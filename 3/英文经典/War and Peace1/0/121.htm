              <p> 　　Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and 
                had not once had time to think of what lay before her.</p>
              <p> 　　In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying 
                carriage, she for the first time vividly imagined what was in 
                store for her there at the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms- 
                with music, flowers, dances, the Emperor, and all the brilliant 
                young people of Petersburg. The prospect was so splendid that 
                she hardly believed it would come true, so out of keeping was 
                it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage. She 
                understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping over 
                the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off 
                her fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in front of her mother, mounted 
                the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then 
                did she remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume 
                the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such 
                an occasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing 
                misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the 
                minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She could not assume 
                that pose, which would have made her ridiculous, and she moved 
                on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might 
                to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that became her 
                best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also 
                talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on 
                the landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, 
                with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her 
                reflection from the others. All was blended into one brilliant 
                procession. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, 
                footsteps, and greetings deafened Natasha, and the light and glitter 
                dazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already 
                been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same 
                words to the various arrivals, &quot;Charme de vous voir,&quot;* 
                greeted the Rostovs and Peronskaya in the same manner. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Delighted to see you.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in 
                her black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess' 
                eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked 
                at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual 
                smile as hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, 
                irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. 
                The host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count 
                which was his daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Charming!&quot; said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.</p>
              <p> 　　In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors 
                awaiting the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of 
                the front rows of that crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several 
                people were asking about her and looking at her. She realized 
                that those noticing her liked her, and this observation helped 
                to calm her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are some like ourselves and some worse,&quot; 
                she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important 
                people at the ball.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired 
                man,&quot; she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of 
                silver-gray curly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing 
                at something he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhova,&quot; 
                said Peronskaya, indicating Helene who had just entered. &quot;How 
                lovely! She is quite equal to Marya Antonovna. See how the men, 
                young and old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they 
                say Prince- is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though 
                not good-looking, are even more run after.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by 
                a very plain daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is a splendid match, a millionairess,&quot; said 
                Peronskaya. &quot;And look, here come her suitors.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Kuragin,&quot; 
                she said, indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who 
                passed by them with head erect, looking at something over the 
                heads of the ladies. &quot;He's handsome, isn't he? I hear they 
                will marry him to that rich girl. But your cousin, Drubetskoy, 
                is also very attentive to her. They say she has millions. Oh yes, 
                that's the French ambassador himself!&quot; she replied to the 
                countess' inquiry about Caulaincourt. &quot;Looks as if he were 
                a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming. 
                No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is 
                still the most beautiful of them all, our Marya Antonovna! And 
                how simply she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles 
                is the universal Freemason,&quot; she went on, indicating Pierre. 
                &quot;Put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through 
                the crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly 
                as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, 
                evidently looking for someone.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, &quot;the 
                buffoon,&quot; as Peronskaya had called him, and knew he was looking 
                for them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at 
                the ball and introduce partners to her.</p>
              <p> 　　But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, 
                dark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by 
                a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natasha 
                at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: 
                it was Bolkonski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, 
                happier, and better-looking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's someone else we know- Bolkonski, do you see, 
                Mamma?&quot; said Natasha, pointing out Prince Andrew. &quot;You 
                remember, he stayed a night with us at Otradnoe.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you know him?&quot; said Peronskaya. &quot;I can't 
                bear him. Il fait a present la pluie et le beau temps.&quot;* 
                He's too proud for anything. Takes after his father. And he's 
                hand in glove with Speranski, writing some project or other. Just 
                look how he treats the ladies! There's one talking to him and 
                he has turned away,&quot; she said, pointing at him. &quot;I'd 
                give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;He is all the rage just now. </p>

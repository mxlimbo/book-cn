              <p> 　　At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports 
                about the war began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal 
                by the Emperor to the people, and of his coming himself from the 
                army to Moscow. And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto 
                or appeal had been received, exaggerated reports became current 
                about them and about the position of Russia. It was said that 
                the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger, it 
                was said that Smolensk had surrendered, that Napoleon had an army 
                of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto 
                was received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at 
                the Rostovs', promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and 
                bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain 
                from Count Rostopchin.</p>
              <p> 　　That Sunday, the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis' 
                private chapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o'clock, 
                when the Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the 
                sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes 
                of the crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, 
                the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching 
                to parade, the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the 
                brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor, 
                that content and discontent with the present, which is most strongly 
                felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, 
                all the Rostovs' acquaintances, were at the Razumovskis' chapel, 
                for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families 
                who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away 
                that summer. As Natasha, at her mother's side, passed through 
                the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, 
                she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's Rostova, the one who...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She's much thinner, but all the same she's pretty!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kuragin and 
                Bolkonski. But she was always imagining that. It always seemed 
                to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what 
                had happened to her. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always 
                was now when she found herself in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac 
                silk dress trimmed with black lace walked- as women can walk- 
                with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and 
                shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she was pretty, but 
                this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary 
                it tormented her more than anything else of late, and particularly 
                so on this bright, hot summer day in town. &quot;It's Sunday again- 
                another week past,&quot; she thought, recalling that she had been 
                here the Sunday before, &quot;and always the same life that is 
                no life, and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy 
                to live. I'm pretty, I'm young, and I know that now I am good. 
                I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,&quot; she thought, 
                &quot;but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to 
                anyone.&quot; She stood by her mother's side and exchanged nods 
                with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies' 
                dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who 
                was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and 
                again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged 
                and was judging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, 
                she felt horrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former 
                purity of her soul was again lost to her.</p>
              <p> 　　A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service 
                with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an 
                effect on the souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary 
                screen were closed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind 
                it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause 
                of which she herself did not understand, made Natasha's breast 
                heave, and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how 
                I may grow good forever, forever!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
              <p> 　　The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar 
                screen and, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from 
                under his dalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, 
                began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer...</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In peace let us pray unto the Lord.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As one community, without distinction of class, without 
                enmity, united by brotherly love- let us pray!&quot; thought Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation 
                of our souls.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell 
                above us,&quot; prayed Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother 
                and Denisov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, 
                she remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to 
                forgive her all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed 
                for those who love us, she prayed for the members of her own family, 
                her father and mother and Sonya, realizing for the first time 
                how wrongly she had acted toward them, and feeling all the strength 
                of her love for them. When they prayed for those who hate us, 
                she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her, in 
                order to pray for them. She included among her enemies the creditors 
                and all who had business dealings with her father, and always 
                at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered 
                Anatole who had done her so much harm- and though he did not hate 
                her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer 
                did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew 
                and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared 
                with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial 
                family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the sign of 
                the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not understand, 
                still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the governing 
                Synod and prayed for it.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole 
                over his breast and said, &quot;Let us commit ourselves and our 
                whole lives to Christ the Lord!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Commit ourselves to God,&quot; Natasha inwardly repeated. 
                &quot;Lord God, I submit myself to Thy will!&quot; she thought. 
                &quot;I want nothing, wish for nothing; teach me what to do and 
                how to use my will! Take me, take me!&quot; prayed Natasha, with 
                impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing herself but letting 
                her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power 
                at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself, from her 
                regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess looked round several times at her daughter's 
                softened face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.</p>
              <p> 　　Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the 
                usual order Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small 
                stool, the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and 
                placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest 
                came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted 
                his hair, and knelt down with an effort. Everybody followed his 
                example and they looked at one another in surprise. Then came 
                the prayer just received from the Synod- a prayer for the deliverance 
                of Russia from hostile invasion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lord God of might, God of our salvation!&quot; began 
                the priest in that voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in 
                which only the Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly 
                on a Russian heart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day 
                in mercy and blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear 
                us, spare us, and have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy 
                land, desiring to lay waste the whole world, rises against us; 
                these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, 
                to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy 
                temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to desecrate our holy 
                shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? 
                How long shall they wield unlawful power?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with 
                Thy might our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander 
                Pavlovich; be mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward 
                him according to his righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy 
                chosen Israel! Bless his counsels, his undertakings, and his work; 
                strengthen his kingdom by Thine almighty hand, and give him victory 
                over his enemy, even as Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, 
                Gideon over Midian, and David over Goliath. Preserve his army, 
                put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves 
                in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength for the fight. 
                Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us; confound and 
                put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may they 
                be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the 
                wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; 
                may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots 
                they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall 
                before Thy servants' feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, 
                Thou art able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and 
                man cannot prevail against Thee!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and 
                loving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from 
                us, but be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness 
                and Thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! 
                Create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, 
                strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with 
                true love one for another, arm us with unity of spirit in the 
                righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our 
                fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against 
                the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put 
                our trust, let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, 
                and give us a token of Thy blessing, that those who hate us and 
                our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish, 
                and may all the nations know that Thou art the Lord and we are 
                Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord, and grant 
                us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice in 
                Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath 
                the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the 
                succor, and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, 
                and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now 
                and forever, world without end. Amen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In Natasha's receptive condition of soul this prayer affected 
                her strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of 
                Moses over Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, 
                and about the destruction of &quot;Thy Jerusalem,&quot; and she 
                prayed to God with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart 
                was overflowing, but without fully understanding what she was 
                asking of God in that prayer. She shared with all her heart in 
                the prayer for the spirit of righteousness, for the strengthening 
                of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation by love. But 
                she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot 
                when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more 
                of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt 
                the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended 
                knees. She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the 
                thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and 
                especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them 
                all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and 
                happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.</p>

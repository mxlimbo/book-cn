            <td> 　　Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummedsteadily 
              and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,beside 
              whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn facewas 
              rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole companyhad 
              settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formedround 
              the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round thebeautiful 
              Princess Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the littlePrincess 
              Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plumpfor her 
              age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and AnnaPavlovna.
              <p>　　The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features 
                andpolished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity 
                but outof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of 
                the circle inwhich he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously 
                serving him upas a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel 
                serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no 
                one who had seenit in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so 
                Anna Pavlovna servedup to her guests, first the vicomte and then 
                the abbe, as peculiarlychoice morsels. The group about Mortemart 
                immediately began discussingthe murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The 
                vicomte said that the Ducd'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, 
                and that there wereparticular reasons for Buonaparte's hatred 
                of him.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,&quot; said 
                Anna Pavlovna,with a pleasant feeling that there was something 
                a la Louis XV inthe sound of that sentence: &quot;Contez nous 
                cela, Vicomte.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingnessto 
                comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyoneto 
                listen to his tale.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;The vicomte knew the duc personally,&quot; whispered 
                Anna Pavlovna to ofthe guests. &quot;The vicomte is a wonderful 
                raconteur,&quot; said she toanother. &quot;How evidently he belongs 
                to the best society,&quot; said she to athird; and the vicomte 
                was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous 
                style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beefon a hot dish.</p>
              <p>　　The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Come over here, Helene, dear,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna 
                to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the 
                center ofanother group.</p>
              <p>　　The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile 
                withwhich she had first entered the room- the smile of a perfectlybeautiful 
                woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmedwith moss 
                and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, andsparkling 
                diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her,not 
                looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciouslyallowing 
                each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure andshapely 
                shoulders, back, and bosom- which in the fashion of those dayswere 
                very much exposed- and she seemed to bring the glamour of aballroom 
                with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was solovely 
                that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but onthe 
                contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all toovictorious 
                beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminishits effect.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;How lovely!&quot; said everyone who saw her; and the 
                vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled 
                by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and 
                beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,&quot; 
                said he,smilingly inclining his head.</p>
              <p>　　The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered 
                a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time thestory 
                was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautifulround 
                arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at herstill 
                more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace. 
                From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, andwhenever 
                the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, atonce 
                adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor'sface, 
                and again relapsed into her radiant smile.</p>
              <p>　　The little princess had also left the tea table and followed 
                Helene.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are 
                you thinkingof?&quot; she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. 
                &quot;Fetch me my workbag.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talkingmerrily 
                to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself inher 
                seat.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Now I am all right,&quot; she said, and asking the vicomte 
                to begin, shetook up her work.</p>
              <p>　　Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circleand 
                moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.</p>
              <p>　　Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance 
                to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact thatin spite 
                of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His featureswere 
                like his sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up 
                bya joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation,and 
                by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on thecontrary 
                was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen self-confidence, 
                while his body was thin and weak. His eyes,nose, and mouth all 
                seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace,and his arms and 
                legs always fell into unnatural positions.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's not going to be a ghost story?&quot; said he, sitting 
                down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as 
                if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why no, my dear fellow,&quot; said the astonished narrator, 
                shrugginghis shoulders.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Because I hate ghost stories,&quot; said Prince Hippolyte 
                in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his 
                words after hehad uttered them.</p>
              <p>　　He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not 
                besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He 
                wasdressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color 
                ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk 
                stockings.</p>
              <p>　　The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, 
                thencurrent, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly 
                toParis to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came 
                uponBonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and 
                that inhis presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the 
                fainting fitsto which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's 
                mercy. The latterspared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently 
                repaid bydeath.</p>
              <p>　　The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the 
                pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the 
                ladieslooked agitated.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Charming!&quot; said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring 
                glance at thelittle princess.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Charming!&quot; whispered the little princess, sticking 
                the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and 
                fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it.</p>
              <p>　　The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared 
                to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept awatchful 
                eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that hewas talking 
                too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried tothe 
                rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout 
                the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested bythe 
                young man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pettheory. 
                Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,which 
                was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the 
                rights ofthe people,&quot; the abbe was saying. &quot;It is only 
                necessary for onepowerful nation like Russia- barbaric as she 
                is said to be- to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of 
                an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance 
                of power of Europe, and it wouldsave the world!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;But how are you to get that balance?&quot; Pierre was 
                beginning.</p>
              <p>　　At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely 
                atPierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. TheItalian's 
                face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected, sugary 
                expression, evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture 
                of thesociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which 
                I havehad the honor of being received, that I have not yet had 
                time to thinkof the climate,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p>　　Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the 
                moreconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them 
                into thelarger circle.</p>

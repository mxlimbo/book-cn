              <p> 　　Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. 
                For three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he 
                lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere.</p>
              <p> 　　It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, 
                who implored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about 
                him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days 
                she would return to Petersburg from abroad.</p>
              <p> 　　Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre 
                respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and, 
                turning the conversation upon Pierre's matrimonial affairs, by 
                way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity 
                to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first 
                rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasili's wife, 
                sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to 
                discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy 
                against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, 
                and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. 
                Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much 
                importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed 
                him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish 
                his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is 
                not to blame,&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his 
                wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not 
                feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would 
                not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was 
                it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife 
                or not?</p>
              <p> 　　Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, 
                Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow 
                to see Joseph Alexeevich. This is what he noted in his diary: 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Moscow, 17th November</p>
              <p> 　　I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write 
                down what I have experienced. Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly 
                and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease 
                of the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word 
                of complaint. From morning till late at night, except when he 
                eats his very plain food, he is working at science. He received 
                me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay. 
                I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem, and 
                he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild smile what 
                I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges. 
                I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had 
                proposed to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, 
                and of my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexeevich, having 
                remained silent and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view 
                of the matter, which at once lit up for me my whole past and the 
                future path I should follow. He surprised me by asking whether 
                I remembered the threefold aim of the order: (1) The preservation 
                and study of the mystery. (2) The purification and reformation 
                of oneself for its reception, and (3) The improvement of the human 
                race by striving for such purification. Which is the principal 
                aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and self-purification. 
                Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances. 
                But at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts 
                of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of this aim, 
                we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity 
                we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the human 
                race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy. 
                Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is attracted 
                by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground Joseph 
                Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the 
                depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs 
                he said to me, &quot;the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have 
                told you, lies in perfecting himself. We often think that by removing 
                all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our 
                aim, but on the contrary, my dear sir, it is only in the midst 
                of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims: (1) 
                Self-knowledge- for man can only know himself by comparison, (2) 
                Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by conflict, and (3) 
                The attainment of the chief virtue- love of death. Only the vicissitudes 
                of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of 
                death or of rebirth to a new life.&quot; These words are all the 
                more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings, 
                Joseph Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death, 
                for which- in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man- 
                he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor 
                then explained to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of 
                creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven 
                are the basis of everything. He advised me not to avoid intercourse 
                with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up only second-grade 
                posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers from 
                pride, to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and self-perfecting. 
                Besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to 
                keep a watch over myself, and to that end he gave me a notebook, 
                the one I am now writing in and in which I will in future note 
                down all my actions. </p>
              <p> 　　Petersburg, 23rd November</p>
              <p> 　　I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me 
                in tears and said that Helene was here and that she implored me 
                to hear her; that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, 
                and much more. I knew that if I once let myself see her I should 
                not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity 
                I did not know whose aid and advice to seek. Had my benefactor 
                been here he would have told me what to do. I went to my room 
                and reread Joseph Alexeevich's letters and recalled my conversations 
                with him, and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a 
                suppliant, and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone- especially 
                to one so closely bound to me- and that I must bear my cross. 
                But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then let union 
                with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and 
                what I wrote to Joseph Alexeevich. I told my wife that I begged 
                her to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have 
                done her, and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to 
                tell her this. She need not know how hard it was for me to see 
                her again. I have settled on the upper floor of this big house 
                and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration. </p>

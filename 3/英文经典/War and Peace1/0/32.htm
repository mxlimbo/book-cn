              <p> 　　The Pavlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. 
                The squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered 
                in the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village 
                were assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov, the squadron commander, 
                known throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov. 
                Cadet Rostov, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, 
                had lived with the squadron commander.</p>
              <p> 　　On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters 
                over the news of Mack's defeat, the camp life of the officers 
                of this squadron was proceeding as usual. Denisov, who had been 
                losing at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rostov rode 
                back early in the morning from a foraging expedition. Rostov in 
                his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, 
                swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement, 
                stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his 
                horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend!&quot; said he to the hussar 
                who rushed up headlong to the horse. &quot;Walk him up and down, 
                my dear fellow,&quot; he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality 
                which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are 
                happy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; answered the Ukrainian gaily, 
                tossing his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mind, walk him up and down well!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko 
                had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's 
                head. It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips 
                and that it paid to serve him. Rostov patted the horse's neck 
                and then his flank, and lingered for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Splendid! What a horse he will be!&quot; he thought 
                with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he 
                ran up the steps of the porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat 
                and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from 
                the cowhouse, looked out, and his face immediately brightened 
                on seeing Rostov. &quot;Schon gut Morgen! Schon gut Morgen!&quot;* 
                he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to greet 
                the young man. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;A very good morning! A very good morning!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Schon fleissig?&quot;* said Rostov with the same gay 
                brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face. &quot;Hoch 
                Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!&quot;*[2] said 
                he, quoting words often repeated by the German landlord. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Busy already?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! 
                Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his 
                cap, and waving it above his head cried:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Und die ganze Welt hoch!&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;And hurrah for the whole world!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and ctied 
                laughing, &quot;Und vivat die ganze Welt!&quot; Though neither 
                the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon 
                from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked 
                at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their 
                heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, 
                the German returning to his cowshed and Rostov going to the cottage 
                he occupied with Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What about your master?&quot; he asked Lavrushka, Denisov's 
                orderly, whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hasn't been in since the evening. Must have been losing,&quot; 
                answered Lavrushka. &quot;I know by now, if he wins he comes back 
                early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means 
                he's lost and will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, bring some.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee. &quot;He's 
                coming!&quot; said he. &quot;Now for trouble!&quot; Rostov looked 
                out of the window and saw Denisov coming home. Denisov was a small 
                man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache 
                and hair. He wore an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down 
                in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of his head. He came 
                up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lavwuska!&quot; he shouted loudly and angrily, &quot;take 
                it off, blockhead!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I am taking it off,&quot; replied Lavrushka's 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, you're up already,&quot; said Denisov, entering 
                the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Long ago,&quot; answered Rostov, &quot;I have already 
                been for the hay, and have seen Fraulein Mathilde.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Weally! And I've been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday 
                like a damned fool!&quot; cried Denisov, not pronouncing his r's. 
                &quot;Such ill luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began 
                and went on. Hullo there! Tea!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short 
                strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle 
                up his thick tangled black hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what devil made me go to that wat?&quot; (an officer 
                nicknamed &quot;the rat&quot;) he said, rubbing his forehead and 
                whole face with both hands. &quot;Just fancy, he didn't let me 
                win a single cahd, not one cahd.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped 
                it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks 
                fly, while he continued to shout.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as 
                one doubles it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw 
                it away. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once 
                looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If at least we had some women here; but there's nothing 
                foh one to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. 
                Hullo, who's there?&quot; he said, turning to the door as he heard 
                a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to 
                a stop, and a respectful cough.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The squadron quartermaster!&quot; said Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov's face puckered still more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wetched!&quot; he muttered, throwing down a purse with 
                some gold in it. &quot;Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much 
                there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow,&quot; he said, 
                and went out to the quartermaster.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov took the money and, mechanically arranging the old 
                and new coins in separate piles, began counting them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! Telyanin! How d'ye do? They plucked me last night,&quot; 
                came Denisov's voice from the next room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where? At Bykov's, at the rat's... I knew it,&quot; 
                replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer 
                of the same squadron, entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp 
                little hand which was offered him. Telyanin for some reason had 
                been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He 
                behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked; Rostov especially 
                detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless 
                antipathy to the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?&quot; 
                he asked. (Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)</p>
              <p> 　　The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight 
                in the face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to 
                another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I saw you riding this morning...&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, he's all right, a good horse,&quot; answered Rostov, 
                though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was 
                not worth half that sum. &quot;He's begun to go a little lame 
                on the left foreleg,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The hoof's cracked! That's nothing. I'll teach you what 
                to do and show you what kind of rivet to use.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, please do,&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret. And 
                it's a horse you'll thank me for.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then I'll have it brought round,&quot; said Rostov wishing 
                to avoid Telyanin, and he went out to give the order.</p>
              <p> 　　In the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the 
                threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On 
                seeing Rostov, Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his 
                shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, 
                he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ugh! I don't like that fellow&quot;' he said, regardless 
                of the quartermaster's presence.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: &quot;Nor 
                do I, but what's one to do?&quot; and, having given his order, 
                he returned to Telyanin.</p>
              <p> 　　Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov 
                had left him, rubbing his small white hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well there certainly are disgusting people,&quot; thought 
                Rostov as he entered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you told them to bring the horse?&quot; asked Telyanin, 
                getting up and looking carelessly about him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denisov 
                about yesterday's order. Have you got it, Denisov?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not yet. But where are you off to?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,&quot; 
                said Telyanin.</p>
              <p> 　　They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant 
                explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage 
                on the table. Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen 
                on a sheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rostov's face and said: 
                &quot;I am witing to her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand 
                and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he 
                wanted to write, told Rostov the contents of his letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, my fwiend,&quot; he said, &quot;we sleep when 
                we don't love. We are childwen of the dust... but one falls in 
                love and one is a God, one is pua' as on the first day of cweation... 
                Who's that now? Send him to the devil, I'm busy!&quot; he shouted 
                to Lavrushka, who went up to him not in the least abashed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It's 
                the quartermaster for the money.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wetched business,&quot; he muttered to himself. &quot;How 
                much is left in the puhse?&quot; he asked, turning to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Seven new and three old imperials.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, it's wetched! Well, what are you standing there 
                for, you sca'cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,&quot; he shouted to 
                Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I have some, 
                you know,&quot; said Rostov, blushing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don't,&quot; 
                growled Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But if you won't accept money from me like a comrade, 
                you will offend me. Really I have some,&quot; Rostov repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I tell you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the 
                pillow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where have you put it, Wostov?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Under the lower pillow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not 
                there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a miwacle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait, haven't you dropped it?&quot; said Rostov, picking 
                up the pillows one at a time and shaking them.</p>
              <p> 　　He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking 
                that you kept it under your head like a treasure,&quot; said Rostov. 
                &quot;I put it just here. Where is it?&quot; he asked, turning 
                to Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I haven't been in the room. It must be where you put 
                it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it isn't?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere 
                and forget it. Feel in your pockets.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, if I hadn't thought of it being a treasure,&quot; 
                said Rostov, &quot;but I remember putting it there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Lavrushka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed 
                and under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the 
                middle of the room. Denisov silently watched Lavrushka's movements, 
                and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was 
                nowhere to be found Denisov glanced at Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wostov, you've not been playing schoolboy twicks...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov felt Denisov's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, 
                and instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed 
                congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. 
                He could not draw breath.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And there hasn't been anyone in the room except the 
                lieutenant and yourselves. It must be here somewhere,&quot; said 
                Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, you devil's puppet, look alive and hunt for 
                it!&quot; shouted Denisov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing 
                at the man with a threatening gesture. &quot;If the purse isn't 
                found I'll flog you, I'll flog you all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began buttoning his coat, 
                buckled on his saber, and put on his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I must have that purse, I tell you,&quot; shouted Denisov, 
                shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against 
                the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Denisov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,&quot; 
                said Rostov, going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denisov 
                paused, thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostov 
                hinted at, seized his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nonsense!&quot; he cried, and the veins on his forehead 
                and neck stood out like cords. &quot;You are mad, I tell you. 
                I won't allow it. The purse is here! I'll flay this scoundwel 
                alive, and it will be found.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know who has taken it,&quot; repeated Rostov in an 
                unsteady voice, and went to the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!&quot; shouted 
                Denisov, rushing at the cadet to restrain him.</p>
              <p> 　　But Rostov pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as 
                though Denisov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly 
                on his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you understand what you're saying?&quot; he said 
                in a trembling voice. &quot;There was no one else in the room 
                except myself. So that if it is not so, then...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He could not finish, and ran out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,&quot; were 
                the last words Rostov heard.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov went to Telyanin's quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The master is not in, he's gone to headquarters,&quot; 
                said Telyanin's orderly. &quot;Has something happened?&quot; he 
                added, surprised at the cadet's troubled face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You've only just missed him,&quot; said the orderly.</p>
              <p> 　　The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, 
                and Rostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. 
                There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented. 
                Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over 
                a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, you've come here too, young man!&quot; he said, 
                smiling and raising his eyebrows.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal 
                to utter the word; and he sat down at the nearest table.</p>
              <p> 　　Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer 
                in the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter 
                of knives and the munching of the lieutenant.</p>
              <p> 　　When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket 
                a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, 
                turned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows 
                gave it to the waiter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please be quick,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　The coin was a new one. Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Allow me to look at your purse,&quot; he said in a low, 
                almost inaudible, voice.</p>
              <p> 　　With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed 
                him the purse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes,&quot; he said, growing 
                suddenly pale, and added, &quot;Look at it, young man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money 
                in it, and looked at Telyanin. The lieutenant was looking about 
                in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there but in 
                these wretched little towns there's nowhere to spend it,&quot; 
                said he. &quot;Well, let me have it, young man, I'm going.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov did not speak.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed 
                you quite decently here,&quot; continued Telyanin. &quot;Now then, 
                let me have it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostov 
                let go of it. Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping 
                it into the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted 
                and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, &quot;Yes, yes, I am 
                putting my purse in my pocket and that's quite simple and is no 
                else's business.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, young man?&quot; he said with a sigh, and from 
                under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostov's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin's eyes 
                to Rostov's and back, and back again and again in an instant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come here,&quot; said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin's 
                arm and almost dragging him to the window. &quot;That money is 
                Denisov's; you took it...&quot; he whispered just above Telyanin's 
                ear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What? How dare you? What?&quot; said Telyanin.</p>
              <p> 　　But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an 
                entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostov heard them, an enormous 
                load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant 
                began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the 
                task he had begun had to be completed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,&quot; 
                muttered Telyanin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small 
                empty room. &quot;We must have an explanation...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know it and shall prove it,&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Every muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to quiver, 
                his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look 
                not rising to Rostov's face, and his sobs were audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count!... Don't ruin a young fellow... here is this 
                wretched money, take it...&quot; He threw it on the table. &quot;I 
                have an old father and mother!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin's eyes, and went 
                out of the room without a word. But at the door he stopped and 
                then retraced his steps. &quot;O God,&quot; he said with tears 
                in his eyes, &quot;how could you do it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count...&quot; said Telyanin drawing nearer to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't touch me,&quot; said Rostov, drawing back. &quot;If 
                you need it, take the money,&quot; and he threw the purse to him 
                and ran out of the inn.</p>

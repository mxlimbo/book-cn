              <p> 　　Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave. 
                Denisov was going home to Voronezh and Rostov persuaded him to 
                travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting 
                a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Denisov 
                had drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting 
                ruts across the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the 
                way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostov, 
                who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable 
                streets, shops, bakers' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!&quot; 
                thought Rostov, when their leave permits had been passed at the 
                town gate and they had entered Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Denisov! We're here! He's asleep,&quot; he added, leaning 
                forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to 
                hasten the speed of the sleigh.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov gave no answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, 
                Zakhar, has his stand, and there's Zakhar himself and still the 
                same horse! And here's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! 
                Can't you hurry up? Now then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which house is it?&quot; asked the driver.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don't 
                you see? That's our house,&quot; said Rostov. &quot;Of course, 
                it's our house! Denisov, Denisov! We're almost there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dmitri,&quot; said Rostov to his valet on the box, &quot;those 
                lights are in our house, aren't they?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir, and there's a light in your father's study.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then they've not gone to bed yet? What do you think? 
                Mind now, don't forget to put out my new coat,&quot; added Rostov, 
                fingering his new mustache. &quot;Now then, get on,&quot; he shouted 
                to the driver. &quot;Do wake up, Vaska!&quot; he went on, turning 
                to Denisov, whose head was again nodding. &quot;Come, get on! 
                You shall have three rubles for vodka- get on!&quot; Rostov shouted, 
                when the sleigh was only three houses from his door. It seemed 
                to him the horses were not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore 
                to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw overhead 
                the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the 
                porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out 
                before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood 
                cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. 
                There was no one in the hall. &quot;Oh God! Is everyone all right?&quot; 
                he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then 
                immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps 
                of the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which 
                always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, 
                turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in 
                the anteroom.</p>
              <p> 　　Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokofy, the footman, 
                who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage 
                from behind, sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He 
                looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference 
                suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gracious heavens! The young count!&quot; he cried, recognizing 
                his young master. &quot;Can it be? My treasure!&quot; and Prokofy, 
                trembling with excitement, rushed toward the drawing-room door, 
                probably in order to announce him, but, changing his mind, came 
                back and stooped to kiss the young man's shoulder.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All well?&quot; asked Rostov, drawing away his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They've just finished supper. 
                Let me have a look at you, your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is everything quite all right?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Lord be thanked, yes!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, who had completely forgotten Denisov, not wishing 
                anyone to forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe 
                through the large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were 
                the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover 
                over it; but someone had already seen the young master, and, before 
                he had reached the drawing room, something flew out from a side 
                door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him. Another 
                and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second 
                door and a third; more hugging, more kissing, more outcries, and 
                tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was Papa, which Natasha, 
                and which Petya. Everyone shouted, talked, and kissed him at the 
                same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed that.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here he is... our own... Kolya,* dear fellow... How 
                he has changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*Nicholas. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And me, kiss me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dearest... and me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhaylovna, Vera, and the old 
                count were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked 
                into the room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, &quot;And me too!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered 
                his face with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, 
                sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and 
                shrieked piercingly.</p>
              <p> 　　All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, 
                and all around were lips seeking a kiss.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with 
                bliss, looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for 
                which she longed. Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, 
                especially at this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She 
                gazed at him, not taking her eyes off him, and smiling and holding 
                her breath. He gave her a grateful look, but was still expectant 
                and looking for someone. The old countess had not yet come. But 
                now steps were heard at the door, steps so rapid that they could 
                hardly be his mother's.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, 
                made since he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran 
                to her. When they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could 
                not lift her face, but only pressed it to the cold braiding of 
                his hussar's jacket. Denisov, who had come into the room unnoticed 
                by anyone, stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vasili Denisov, your son's friend,&quot; he said, introducing 
                himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are most welcome! I know, I know,&quot; said the 
                count, kissing and embracing Denisov. &quot;Nicholas wrote us... 
                Natasha, Vera, look! Here is Denisov!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure 
                of Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Darling Denisov!&quot; screamed Natasha, beside herself 
                with rapture, springing to him, putting her arms round him, and 
                kissing him. This escapade made everybody feel confused. Denisov 
                blushed too, but smiled and, taking Natasha's hand, kissed it.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostovs 
                all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.</p>
              <p> 　　The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it 
                every moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched 
                every movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully 
                adoring eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the 
                places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should 
                bring him his tea, handkerchief, and pipe.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him; but the 
                first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present 
                joy seemed insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, 
                more and yet more.</p>
              <p> 　　Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers 
                slept till ten o'clock.</p>
              <p> 　　In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers, 
                satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two 
                freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. 
                The servants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, 
                and their well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and 
                a smell of tobacco.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hallo, Gwiska- my pipe!&quot; came Vasili Denisov's 
                husky voice. &quot;Wostov, get up!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised 
                his disheveled head from the hot pillow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, is it late?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Late! It's nearly ten o'clock,&quot; answered Natasha's 
                voice. A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and 
                laughter of girls' voices came from the adjoining room. The door 
                was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, 
                of ribbons, black hair, and merry faces. It was Natasha, Sonya, 
                and Petya, who had come to see whether they were getting up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas! Get up!&quot; Natasha's voice was again heard 
                at the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Directly!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in the 
                outer room, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military 
                elder brother, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls 
                to see men undressed, opened the bedroom door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this your saber?&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　The girls sprang aside. Denisov hid his hairy legs under the 
                blanket, looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The 
                door, having let Petya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came 
                from behind it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!&quot; said 
                Natasha's voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this your saber?&quot; asked Petya. &quot;Or is it 
                yours?&quot; he said, addressing the black-mustached Denisov with 
                servile deference.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing 
                gown, and went out. Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was 
                just getting her foot into the other. Sonya, when he came in, 
                was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a 
                balloon and sit down. They were dressed alike, in new pale-blue 
                frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and bright. Sonya ran away, 
                but Natasha, taking her brother's arm, led him into the sitting 
                room, where they began talking. They hardly gave one another time 
                to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little 
                matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. Natasha 
                laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because 
                what they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy 
                and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how nice, how splendid!&quot; she said to everything.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of 
                love, that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his 
                face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen 
                months again brightened his soul and his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but listen,&quot; she said, &quot;now you are quite 
                a man, aren't you? I'm awfully glad you're my brother.&quot; She 
                touched his mustache. &quot;I want to know what you men are like. 
                Are you the same as we? No?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why did Sonya run away?&quot; asked Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How are you going 
                to speak to her- thou or you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As may happen,&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, call her you, please! I'll tell you all about it 
                some other time. No, I'll tell you now. You know Sonya's my dearest 
                friend. Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look 
                here!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar 
                on her long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that 
                part that is covered even by a ball dress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated 
                a ruler in the fire and pressed it there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, 
                in what used to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natasha's 
                wildly bright eyes, Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood 
                which had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the 
                best joys of his life; and the burning of an arm with a ruler 
                as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless, he understood 
                and was not surprised at it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and is that all?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business 
                was just nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves 
                anyone, does it for life, but I don't understand that, I forget 
                quickly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, she loves me and you like that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha suddenly flushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she 
                says you are to forget all that.... She says: 'I shall love him 
                always, but let him be free.' Isn't that lovely and noble! Yes, 
                very noble? Isn't it?&quot; asked Natasha, so seriously and excitedly 
                that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked 
                of before, with tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov became thoughtful.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I never go back on my word,&quot; he said. &quot;Besides, 
                Sonya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, no!&quot; cried Natasha, &quot;she and I have already 
                talked it over. We knew you'd say so. But it won't do, because 
                you see, if you say that- if you consider yourself bound by your 
                promise- it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously. It 
                makes it as if you were marrying her because you must, and that 
                wouldn't do at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them. Sonya 
                had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, 
                when he had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. 
                She was a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in 
                love with him (he did not doubt that for an instant). Why should 
                he not love her now, and even marry her, Rostov thought, but just 
                now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him! 
                &quot;Yes, they have taken a wise decision,&quot; he thought, 
                &quot;I must remain free.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, that's excellent,&quot; said he. &quot;We'll 
                talk it over later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and are you still true to Boris?&quot; he continued.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what nonsense!&quot; cried Natasha, laughing. &quot;I 
                don't think about him or anyone else, and I don't want anything 
                of the kind.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me! Then what are you up now?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now?&quot; repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up 
                her face. &quot;Have you seen Duport?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not seen Duport- the famous dancer? Well then, you won't 
                understand. That's what I'm up to.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do, 
                ran back a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little 
                feet sharply together, and made some steps on the very tips of 
                her toes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;See, I'm standing! See!&quot; she said, but could not 
                maintain herself on her toes any longer. &quot;So that's what 
                I'm up to! I'll never marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only 
                don't tell anyone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in his bedroom, 
                felt envious and Natasha could not help joining in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but don't you think it's nice?&quot; she kept repeating.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha flared up. &quot;I don't want to marry anyone. And 
                I'll tell him so when I see him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me!&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that's all rubbish,&quot; Natasha chattered on. 
                &quot;And is Denisov nice?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible, 
                Denisov?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why terrible?&quot; asked Nicholas. &quot;No, Vaska 
                is a splendid fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You call him Vaska? That's funny! And is he very nice?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, be quick. We'll all have breakfast together.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like 
                a ballet dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can 
                smile. When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room, he reddened. 
                He did not know how to behave with her. The evening before, in 
                the first happy moment of meeting, they had kissed each other, 
                but today they felt it could not be done; he felt that everybody, 
                including his mother and sisters, was looking inquiringly at him 
                and watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed her 
                hand and addressed her not as thou but as you- Sonya. But their 
                eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks 
                asked him to forgive her for having dared, by Natasha's intermediacy, 
                to remind him of his promise, and then thanked him for his love. 
                His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her 
                that one way or another he would never cease to love her, for 
                that would be impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How strange it is,&quot; said Vera, selecting a moment 
                when all were silent, &quot;that Sonya and Nicholas now say you 
                to one another and meet like strangers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Vera's remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, 
                like most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, 
                not only Sonya, Nicholas, and Natasha, but even the old countess, 
                who- dreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from 
                making a brilliant match- blushed like a girl.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov, to Rostov's surprise, appeared in the drawing room 
                with pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just 
                as smart as he made himself when going into battle, and he was 
                more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than Rostov had ever 
                expected to see him. </p>

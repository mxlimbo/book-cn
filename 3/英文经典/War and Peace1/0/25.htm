            <td>　　At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski's estate, 
              thearrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, 
              butthis expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in 
              theold prince's household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich(nicknamed 
              in society, &quot;the King of Prussia&quot;) ever since the EmperorPaul 
              had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuouslywith 
              his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, MademoiselleBourienne. 
              Though in the new reign he was free to return to thecapitals, he 
              still continued to live in the country, remarking thatanyone who 
              wanted to see him could come the hundred miles fromMoscow to Bald 
              Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. Heused to say 
              that there are only two sources of human vice- idlenessand superstition, 
              and only two virtues- activity and intelligence.He himself undertook 
              his daughter's education, and to develop thesetwo cardinal virtues 
              in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometrytill she was twenty, 
              and arranged her life so that her whole timewas occupied. He was 
              himself always occupied: writing his memoirs,solving problems in 
              higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe,working in the 
              garden, or superintending the building that wasalways going on at 
              his estate. As regularity is a prime conditionfacilitating activity, 
              regularity in his household was carried tothe highest point of exactitude. 
              He always came to table underprecisely the same conditions, and 
              not only at the same hour but atthe same minute. With those about 
              him, from his daughter to his serfs,the prince was sharp and invariably 
              exacting, so that without beinga hardhearted man he inspired such 
              fear and respect as few hardheartedmen would have aroused. Although 
              he was in retirement and had now noinfluence in political affairs, 
              every high official appointed to theprovince in which the prince's 
              estate lay considered it his duty tovisit him and waited in the 
              lofty antechamber ante chamber just as thearchitect, gardener, or 
              Princess Mary did, till the prince appearedpunctually to the appointed 
              hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamberexperienced the same feeling 
              of respect and even fear when theenormously high study door opened 
              and showed the figure of a rathersmall old man, with powdered wig, 
              small withered hands, and bushy grayeyebrows which, when he frowned, 
              sometimes hid the gleam of hisshrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.
              <p>　　On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive,Princess 
                Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointedfor 
                the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation andrepeating 
                a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, andevery 
                morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.</p>
              <p>　　An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber 
                rosequietly and said in a whisper: &quot;Please walk in.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princesstimidly 
                opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She pausedat 
                the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and afterglancing 
                round continued his work.</p>
              <p>　　The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant 
                use. Thelarge table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-frontedbookcases 
                with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing whilestanding 
                up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe withtools 
                laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around- allindicated 
                continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion ofthe small 
                foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, andthe firm 
                pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the princestill 
                possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age.After 
                a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from thepedal, 
                wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached tothe 
                lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He nevergave 
                his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristlycheek 
                (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively,said 
                severely:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Quite well? All right then, sit down.&quot; He took the 
                exercise bookcontaining lessons in geometry written by himself 
                and drew up achair with his foot.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;For tomorrow!&quot; said he, quickly finding the page 
                and making ascratch from one paragraph to another with his hard 
                nail.</p>
              <p>　　The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Wait a bit, here's a letter for you,&quot; said the old 
                man suddenly,taking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from 
                a bag hanging abovethe table, onto which he threw it.</p>
              <p>　　At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on 
                theprincess' face. She took it quickly and bent her head over 
                it.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;From Heloise?&quot; asked the prince with a cold smile 
                that showed hisstill sound, yellowish teeth.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, it's from Julie,&quot; replied the princess with 
                a timid glance anda timid smile.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll read,&quot; 
                saidthe prince sternly; &quot;I'm afraid you write much nonsense. 
                I'll read thethird!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Read this if you like, Father,&quot; said the princess, 
                blushing stillmore and holding out the letter.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;The third, I said the third!&quot; cried the prince abruptly, 
                pushingthe letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he 
                drew towardhim the exercise book containing geometrical figures.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, madam,&quot; he began, stooping over the book close 
                to hisdaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on 
                which she sat,so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides 
                by the acrid scent ofold age and tobacco, which she had known 
                so long. &quot;Now, madam, thesetriangles are equal; please note 
                that the angle ABC...&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyesglittering 
                close to her; the red patches on her face came and went,and it 
                was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightenedthat 
                her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father'sfurther 
                explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it wasthe teacher's 
                fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened everyday: the princess' 
                eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hearanything, but 
                was only conscious of her stern father's withered faceclose to 
                her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think onlyof 
                how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problemin 
                peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on whichhe 
                was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to controlhimself 
                and not become vehement, but almost always did becomevehement, 
                scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.</p>
              <p>　　The princess gave a wrong answer.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well now, isn't she a fool!&quot; shouted the prince, 
                pushing the bookaside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, 
                he paced upand down, lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat 
                down again.</p>
              <p>　　He drew up his chair. and continued to explain.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;This won't do, Princess; it won't do,&quot; said he, 
                when Princess Mary,having taken and closed the exercise book with 
                the next day'slesson, was about to leave: &quot;Mathematics are 
                most important, madam!I don't want to have you like our silly 
                ladies. Get used to it andyou'll like it,&quot; and he patted 
                her cheek. &quot;It will drive all thenonsense out of your head.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took 
                anuncut book from the high desk.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise 
                hassent you. Religious! I don't interfere with anyone's belief... 
                Ihave looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after 
                her.</p>
              <p>　　Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scaredexpression 
                that rarely left her and which made her plain, sicklyface yet 
                plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stoodminiature 
                portraits and which was littered with books and papers.The princess 
                was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down thegeometry 
                book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was fromher 
                most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karaginawho 
                had been at the Rostovs' name-day party.</p>
              <p>　　Julie wrote in French:</p>
              <p>　　Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing 
                isseparation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half 
                myhappiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distanceseparating 
                us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heartrebels 
                against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractionsaround 
                me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been inmy 
                heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were 
                Lastsummer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential 
                sofa?Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strengthfrom 
                your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved sowell 
                and seem to see before me as I write?</p>
              <p>　　Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into 
                themirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungracefulfigure 
                and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particularhopelessness 
                at her reflection in the glass. &quot;She flatters me,&quot;thought 
                the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Juliedid 
                not flatter her friend, the princess' eyes- large, deep andluminous 
                (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shaftsof warm 
                light)- were so beautiful that very often in spite of theplainness 
                of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful thanthat 
                of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression 
                ofher own eyes- the look they had when she was not thinking ofherself. 
                As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnaturalexpression 
                as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:</p>
              <p>　　All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers 
                isalready abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting 
                ontheir march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburgand 
                it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chancesof 
                war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying thepeace 
                of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased theAlmighty, 
                in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothingof my 
                brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associationsnearest 
                my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostov, who with hisenthusiasm 
                could not bear to remain inactive and has left theuniversity to 
                join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that inspite 
                of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a greatgrief 
                to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you Last summer, is 
                sonoble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom 
                findsnowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he 
                is so frankand has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that 
                my relations withhim, transient as they were, have been one of 
                the sweetest comforts tomy poor heart, which has already suffered 
                so much. Someday I will tellyou about our parting and all that 
                was said then. That is still toofresh. Ah, dear friend, you are 
                happy not to know these poignantjoys and sorrows. You are fortunate, 
                for the latter are generallythe stronger! I know very well that 
                Count Nicholas is too young everto be more to me than a friend, 
                but this sweet friendship, this poeticand pure intimacy, were 
                what my heart needed. But enough of this!The chief news, about 
                which all Moscow gossips, is the death of oldCount Bezukhov, and 
                his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesseshave received very 
                little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is MonsieurPierre who has 
                inherited all the property and has besides beenrecognized as legitimate; 
                so that he is now Count Bezukhov andpossessor of the finest fortune 
                in Russia. It is rumored that PrinceVasili played a very despicable 
                part in this affair and that hereturned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.</p>
              <p>　　I confess I understand very little about all these matters 
                ofwills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, 
                whomwe all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become CountBezukhov 
                and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, Iam much 
                amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of themammas 
                burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladiesthemselves, 
                toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemedto me 
                a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people haveamused 
                themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don'teven 
                know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me asthe 
                future Countess Bezukhova. But you will understand that I haveno 
                desire for the post. A propos of marriages: do you know that awhile 
                ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna told me, under theseal 
                of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neithermore 
                nor less than with Prince Vasili's son Anatole, whom they wish 
                toreform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee, and it 
                is onyou that his relations' choice has fallen. I don't know what 
                youwill think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know 
                of it.He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. 
                That isall I have been able to find out about him.</p>
              <p>　　But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of 
                paper,and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins'. 
                Read themystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success 
                here.Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human 
                mind tograsp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates 
                the soul.Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my 
                complimentsto Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love 
                you.</p>
              <p>　　 JULIE</p>
              <p>　　P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little 
                wife.</p>
              <p>　　The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and herluminous 
                eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Thenshe 
                suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. Shetook 
                a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This isthe 
                reply she wrote, also in French:</p>
              <p>　　Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given 
                me greatdelight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, 
                of whichyou say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had 
                its usualeffect on you. You complain of our separation. What then 
                should I say,if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who 
                are dear to me?Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would 
                be very sad. Whydo you suppose that I should look severely on 
                your affection forthat young man? On such matters I am only severe 
                with myself. Iunderstand such feelings in others, and if never 
                having felt them Icannot approve of them, neither do I condemn 
                them. Only it seems to methat Christian love, love of one's neighbor, 
                love of one's enemy, isworthier, sweeter, and better than the 
                feelings which the beautifuleyes of a young man can inspire in 
                a romantic and loving young girllike yourself.</p>
              <p>　　The news of Count Bezukhov's death reached us before your letter 
                andmy father was much affected by it. He says the count was the 
                Lastrepresentative but one of the great century, and that it is 
                his ownturn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn 
                come aslate as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!</p>
              <p>　　I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. 
                Healways seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is 
                thequality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the 
                partplayed by Prince Vasili, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dearfriend, 
                our divine Saviour's words, that it is easier for a camel togo 
                through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter theKingdom 
                of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasili but am stillmore 
                sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches- towhat 
                temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desiremost 
                on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. Athousand 
                thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me andwhich 
                has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that amongsome 
                good things it contains others which our weak human understandingcannot 
                grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in readingwhat 
                is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I nevercould 
                understand the fondness some people have for confusing theirminds 
                by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubtsand 
                excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggerationquite 
                contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read theEpistles 
                and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries theycontain; 
                for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know theterrible 
                and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in thisflesh which 
                forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Letus rather 
                confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules whichour divine 
                Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try toconform 
                to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the lesswe 
                let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God,who 
                rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less 
                weseek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, 
                the soonerwill He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine 
                Spirit.</p>
              <p>　　My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told 
                methat he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from 
                PrinceVasili. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I 
                will tell you,dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a 
                divine institutionto which we must conform. However painful it 
                may be to me, shouldthe Almighty lay the duties of wife and wife 
                and mother upon me Ishall try to perform them as faithfully as 
                I can, withoutdisquieting myself by examining my feelings toward 
                him whom He maygive me for husband.</p>
              <p>　　I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedyarrival 
                at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a briefone, 
                however, for he will leave, us again to take part in this unhappywar 
                into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not onlywhere 
                you are- at the heart of affairs and of the world- is the talkall 
                of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature- whichtownsfolk 
                consider characteristic of the country- rumors of war areheard 
                and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches andcountermarches, 
                things of which I understand nothing; and the daybefore yesterday 
                during my daily walk through the village Iwitnessed a heartrending 
                scene.... It was a convoy of conscriptsenrolled from our people 
                and starting to join the army. You shouldhave seen the state of 
                the mothers, wives, and children of the men whowere going and 
                should have heard the sobs. It seems as thoughmankind has forgotten 
                the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preachedlove and forgiveness 
                of injuries- and that men attribute thegreatest merit to skill 
                in killing one another.</p>
              <p>　　Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His 
                mostHoly Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!</p>
              <p>　　MARY</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have alreadydispatched 
                mine. I have written to my poor mother,&quot; said the smilingMademoiselle 
                Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones andwith guttural 
                r's. She brought into Princess Mary's strenuous,mournful, and 
                gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless,lighthearted, 
                and self-satisfied.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Princess, I must warn you,&quot; she added, lowering 
                her voice andevidently listening to herself with pleasure, and 
                speaking withexaggerated grasseyement, &quot;the prince has been 
                scolding MichaelIvanovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. 
                Be prepared.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, dear friend,&quot; replied Princess Mary, &quot;I 
                have asked you never towarn me of the humor my father is in. I 
                do not allow myself to judgehim and would not have others do so.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was 
                fiveminutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went 
                into thesitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and 
                two o'clock,as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the 
                princess playedthe clavichord.</p>

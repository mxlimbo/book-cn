              <p> 　　The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the 
                sides was some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the 
                back was a cloth stretched over boards. In the center of the stage 
                sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl 
                in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of 
                which a piece of green cardboard was glued. They all sang something. 
                When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to 
                the prompter's box and a man with tight silk trousers over his 
                stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and 
                began singing, waving his arms about.</p>
              <p> 　　First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, 
                then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered 
                the hand of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to 
                start singing with her. They sang together and everyone in the 
                theater began clapping and shouting, while the man and woman on 
                the stage- who represented lovers- began smiling, spreading out 
                their arms, and bowing.</p>
              <p> 　　After her life in the country, and in her present serious 
                mood, all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could 
                not follow the opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only 
                the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who 
                moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She 
                knew what it was all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously 
                false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors 
                and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the audience, 
                seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she 
                herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was 
                happening on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natasha 
                seemed feigned. &quot;I suppose it has to be like this!&quot; 
                she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded 
                heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes, 
                especially at Helene in the next box, who- apparently quite unclothed- 
                sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her eyes off the stage. 
                And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and 
                the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little by little began 
                to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for 
                a long while. She did not realize who and where she was, nor what 
                was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the strangest 
                fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind: 
                the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and 
                singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch 
                with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to 
                lean over to Helene and tickle her.</p>
              <p> 　　At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of 
                a song, a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostovs' 
                box creaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. &quot;There's 
                Kuragin!&quot; whispered Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling 
                to the newcomer, and Natasha, following the direction of that 
                look, saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their 
                box with a self-assured yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole 
                Kuragin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in 
                Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant's uniform with one epaulet 
                and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained swagger which 
                would have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and 
                had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored 
                complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was proceeding, 
                he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword and 
                spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high. 
                Having looked at Natasha he approached his sister, laid his well 
                gloved hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning 
                forward asked a question, with a motion toward Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mais charmante!&quot; said he, evidently referring to 
                Natasha, who did not exactly hear his words but understood them 
                from the movement of his lips. Then he took his place in the first 
                row of the stalls and sat down beside Dolokhov, nudging with his 
                elbow in a friendly and offhand way that Dolokhov whom others 
                treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily, smiled, and rested 
                his foot against the orchestra screen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How like the brother is to the sister,&quot; remarked 
                the count. &quot;And how handsome they both are!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Shinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some 
                intrigue of Kuragin's in Moscow, and Natasha tried to overhear 
                it just because he had said she was &quot;charmante.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving 
                about, going out and coming in.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris came to the Rostovs' box, received their congratulations 
                very simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile 
                conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee's invitation to her 
                wedding, and went away. Natasha with a gay, coquettish smile talked 
                to him, and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same 
                Boris with whom she had formerly been in love. In the state of 
                intoxication she was in, everything seemed simple and natural.</p>
              <p> 　　The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, 
                and Natasha gave Boris a similar smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene's box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by 
                the most distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie 
                with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　During the whole of that entr'acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov 
                in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostovs' box. 
                Natasha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. 
                She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she 
                thought was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of 
                the second act Pierre appeared in the stalls. The Rostovs had 
                not seen him since their arrival. His face looked sad, and he 
                had grown still stouter since Natasha last saw him. He passed 
                up to the front rows, not noticing anyone. Anatole went up to 
                him and began speaking to him, looking at and indicating the Rostovs' 
                box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew animated and, hastily passing 
                between the rows, came toward their box. When he got there he 
                leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long time. 
                While conversing with Pierre, Natasha heard a man's voice in Countess 
                Bezukhova's box and something told her it was Kuragin. She turned 
                and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her 
                eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange 
                to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he 
                admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, 
                there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades 
                were raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass 
                came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left 
                wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their 
                hands. They began waving their arms. Then some other people ran 
                in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and 
                was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once, but 
                sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, 
                and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times 
                and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were 
                repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.</p>
              <p> 　　During this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls 
                she saw Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of 
                his chair, staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was 
                captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything 
                wrong in it.</p>
              <p> 　　When the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose, turned 
                to the Rostovs' box- her whole bosom completely exposed- beckoned 
                the old count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to 
                those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,&quot; 
                said she. &quot;The whole town is singing their praises and I 
                don't even know then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was 
                so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed 
                with pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want to become a Moscovite too, now,&quot; said Helene. 
                &quot;How is it you're not ashamed to bury such pearls in the 
                country?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being 
                a fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think- especially 
                what was flattering- quite simply and naturally.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! 
                Though I am not staying here long this time- nor are you- I will 
                try to amuse them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg 
                and wanted to get to know you,&quot; said she to Natasha with 
                her stereotyped and lovely smile. &quot;I had heard about you 
                from my page, Drubetskoy. Have you heard he is getting married? 
                And also from my husband's friend Bolkonski, Prince Andrew Bolkonski,&quot; 
                she went on with special emphasis, implying that she knew of his 
                relation to Natasha. To get better acquainted she asked that one 
                of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the 
                performance, and Natasha moved over to it.</p>
              <p> 　　The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many 
                candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards 
                hung on the walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king 
                and a queen. The king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, 
                sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden 
                who had been first in white and then in light blue, now wore only 
                a smock, and stood beside the throne with her hair down. She sang 
                something mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king waved 
                his arm severely, and men and women with bare legs came in from 
                both sides and began dancing all together. Then the violins played 
                very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare 
                legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the 
                wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, 
                and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. 
                In the stalls everyone clapped and shouted &quot;bravo!&quot; 
                Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals 
                and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly, and this man 
                with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very 
                rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles a 
                year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and galleries 
                began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the man 
                stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other 
                men and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted 
                to the sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly 
                a storm came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were 
                heard in the orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of 
                their number away, and the curtain dropped. Once more there was 
                a terrible noise and clatter among the audience, and with rapturous 
                faces everyone began shouting: &quot;Duport! Duport! Duport!&quot; 
                Natasha no longer thought this strange. She look about with pleasure, 
                smiling joyfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Isn't Duport delightful?&quot; Helene asked her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied Natasha. </p>

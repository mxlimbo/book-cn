              <p> 　　No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha's engagement 
                to Bolkonski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. 
                He said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear 
                the whole burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself 
                forever, but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her 
                perfect freedom. If after six months she felt that she did not 
                love him she would have full right to reject him. Naturally neither 
                Natasha nor her parents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew 
                was firm. He came every day to the Rostovs', but did not behave 
                to Natasha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiar 
                thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand. After their 
                engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural relations sprang 
                up between them. It was as if they had not known each other till 
                now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when 
                as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves 
                now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural 
                and sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse 
                with Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for 
                a long time Natasha trained the family to get used to him, proudly 
                assuring them all that he only appeared to be different, but was 
                really just like all of them, and that she was not afraid of him 
                and no one else ought to be. After a few days they grew accustomed 
                to him, and without restraint in his presence pursued their usual 
                way of life, in which he took his part. He could talk about rural 
                economy with the count, fashions with the countess and Natasha, 
                and about albums and fancywork with Sonya. Sometimes the household 
                both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder 
                at how it had all happened, and at the evident omens there had 
                been of it: Prince Andrew's coming to Otradnoe and their coming 
                to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and Prince Andrew 
                which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew's encounter 
                with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening that 
                it had to be.</p>
              <p> 　　In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which 
                always accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when 
                all sitting together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others 
                would get up and go away and the couple, left alone, still remained 
                silent. They rarely spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew 
                was afraid and ashamed to speak of it. Natasha shared this as 
                she did all his feelings, which she constantly divined. Once she 
                began questioning him about his son. Prince Andrew blushed, as 
                he often did now- Natasha particularly liked it in him- and said 
                that his son would not live with them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Natasha in a frightened tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How I should have loved him!&quot; said Natasha, immediately 
                guessing his thought; &quot;but I know you wish to avoid any pretext 
                for finding fault with us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, 
                and ask his advice about Petya's education or Nicholas' service. 
                The old countess sighed as she looked at them; Sonya was always 
                getting frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to 
                find excuses for leaving them alone, even when they did not wish 
                it. When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell a story very well), 
                Natasha listened to him with pride; when she spoke she noticed 
                with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly 
                at her. She asked herself in perplexity: &quot;What does he look 
                for in me? He is trying to discover something by looking at me! 
                What if what he seeks in me is not there?&quot; Sometimes she 
                fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and 
                then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew 
                laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself 
                entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt 
                nearer to him. Natasha would have been completely happy if the 
                thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not 
                terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale 
                and cold.</p>
              <p> 　　On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew 
                brought with him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs' once 
                since the ball. Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He 
                was talking to the countess, and Natasha sat down beside a little 
                chess table with Sonya, thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come 
                too. He did so.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have known Bezukhov a long time?&quot; he asked. 
                &quot;Do you like him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, he's a dear, but very absurd.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes 
                of his absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented 
                about him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I 
                have known him from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, 
                Natalie,&quot; Prince Andrew said with sudden seriousness- &quot;I 
                am going away and heaven knows what may happen. You may cease 
                to... all right, I know I am not to say that. Only this, then: 
                whatever may happen to you when I am not here...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can happen?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whatever trouble may come,&quot; Prince Andrew continued, 
                &quot;I beg you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to 
                turn to him alone for advice and help! He is a most absent-minded 
                and absurd fellow, but he has a heart of gold.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Neither her father, nor her mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince 
                Andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from her 
                lover would act on Natasha. Flushed and agitated she went about 
                the house all that day, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters 
                as if not understanding what awaited her. She did not even cry 
                when, on taking leave, he kissed her hand for the last time. &quot;Don't 
                go!&quot; she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really 
                ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards. Nor 
                did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat in 
                her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying 
                now and then, &quot;Oh, why did he go away?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those 
                around her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly 
                and became her old self again, but with a change in her moral 
                physiognomy, as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed 
                expression of face.</p>

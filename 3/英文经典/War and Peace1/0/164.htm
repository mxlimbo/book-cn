              <p> 　　From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending 
                to go away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the 
                Rostovs came to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him 
                hasten to carry out his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph 
                Alexeevich's widow, who had long since promised to hand over to 
                him some papers of her deceased husband's.</p>
              <p> 　　When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from 
                Marya Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of 
                great importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed. 
                Pierre had been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that 
                his feeling for her was stronger than a married man's should be 
                for his friend's fiancee. Yet some fate constantly threw them 
                together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can have happened? And what can they want with 
                me?&quot; thought he as he dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna's. 
                &quot;If only Prince Andrew would hurry up and come and marry 
                her!&quot; thought he on his way to the house.</p>
              <p> 　　On the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pierre! Been back long?&quot; someone shouted. Pierre 
                raised his head. In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses 
                that were bespattering the dashboard with snow, Anatole and his 
                constant companion Makarin dashed past. Anatole was sitting upright 
                in the classic pose of military dandies, the lower part of his 
                face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent. His 
                face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, tilted to one side, 
                disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery 
                snow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, indeed, that's a true sage,&quot; thought Pierre. 
                &quot;He sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing 
                troubles him and so he is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. 
                What wouldn't I give to be like him!&quot; he thought enviously.</p>
              <p> 　　In Marya Dmitrievna's anteroom the footman who helped him 
                off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come 
                to her bedroom.</p>
              <p> 　　When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting 
                at the window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced 
                round at him, frowned, and left the room with an expression of 
                cold dignity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Pierre, entering Marya 
                Dmitrievna's room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine doings!&quot; answered Dmitrievna. &quot;For fifty-eight 
                years have I lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she 
                told him, Marya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused 
                Prince Andrew without her parents' knowledge and that the cause 
                of this was Anatole Kuragin into whose society Pierre's wife had 
                thrown her and with whom Natasha had tried to elope during her 
                father's absence, in order to be married secretly.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what 
                was told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince 
                Andrew's deeply loved affianced wife- the same Natasha Rostova 
                who used to be so charming- should give up Bolkonski for that 
                fool Anatole who was already secretly married (as Pierre knew), 
                and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with 
                him, was something Pierre could not conceive and could not imagine.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha, 
                whom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her 
                baseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. &quot;They 
                are all alike!&quot; he said to himself, reflecting that he was 
                not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. 
                But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized 
                with his wounded pride, and the more he pitied his friend the 
                more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that 
                Natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look 
                of cold dignity. He did not know that Natasha's soul was overflowing 
                with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not her 
                fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity 
                and severity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how get married?&quot; said Pierre, in answer to 
                Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;He could not marry- he is married!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Things get worse from hour to hour!&quot; ejaculated 
                Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;A nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she's 
                expecting him- expecting him since yesterday. She must be told! 
                Then at least she won't go on expecting him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After hearing the details of Anatole's marriage from Pierre, 
                and giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, 
                Marya Dmitrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was 
                afraid that the count or Bolkonski, who might arrive at any moment, 
                if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) 
                might challenge Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre 
                to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not 
                dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre- only now realizing 
                the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew- promised 
                to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her 
                wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know 
                nothing either,&quot; she said. &quot;And I will go and tell her 
                it is no use expecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!&quot; 
                she called after Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That 
                morning Natasha had told him that she had rejected Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!&quot; he said to 
                Pierre. &quot;What troubles one has with these girls without their 
                mother! I do so regret having come here.... I will be frank with 
                you. Have you heard she has broken off her engagement without 
                consulting anybody? It's true this engagement never was much to 
                my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but still, with his 
                father's disapproval they wouldn't have been happy, and Natasha 
                won't lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and to 
                take such a step without father's or mother's consent! And now 
                she's ill, and God knows what! It's hard, Count, hard to manage 
                daughters in their mother's absence....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change 
                the subject, but the count returned to his troubles.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya entered the room with an agitated face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha is not quite well; she's in her room and would 
                like to see you. Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks 
                you to come.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkonski's, no doubt 
                she wants to send him a message,&quot; said the count. &quot;Oh 
                dear! Oh dear! How happy it all was!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count 
                left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　When Marya Dmitrievna told Natasha that Anatole was married, 
                Natasha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed 
                by Pierre himself. Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along 
                the corridor to Natasha's room.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, 
                and her eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning 
                look the moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only 
                gazed fixedly at him, and her look asked only one thing: was he 
                a friend, or <br>
                like the others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, 
                he evidently did not exist for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He knows all about it,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna pointing 
                to Pierre and addressing Natasha. &quot;Let him tell you whether 
                I have told the truth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded 
                animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natalya Ilynichna,&quot; Pierre began, dropping his 
                eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing 
                he had to do, &quot;whether it is true or not should make no difference 
                to you, because...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then it is not true that he's married!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it is true.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has he been married long?&quot; she asked. &quot;On 
                your honor?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre gave his word of honor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he still here?&quot; she asked, quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I have just seen him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her 
                hands that they should leave her alone.</p>

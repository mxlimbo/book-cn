              <p> 　　During the entr'acte a whiff of cold air came into Helene's 
                box, the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying 
                not to brush against anyone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me introduce my brother to you,&quot; said Helene, 
                her eyes shifting uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young 
                officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who 
                was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside 
                her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness- ever 
                since the Naryshkins' ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered 
                pleasure of seeing her. Kuragin was much more sensible and simple 
                with women than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and 
                Natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there 
                was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much 
                talk, but that on the contrary his smile was most naive, cheerful, 
                and good-natured.</p>
              <p> 　　Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her 
                how at a previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the 
                stage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you know, Countess,&quot; he said, suddenly addressing 
                her as an old, familiar acquaintance, &quot;we are getting up 
                a costume tournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be 
                great fun. We shall all meet at the Karagins'! Please come! No! 
                Really, eh?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her 
                face, her neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that 
                he was enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made 
                her feel constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at 
                him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily 
                caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this. 
                But looking into his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there 
                was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself 
                and other men. She did not know how it was that within five minutes 
                she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man. When she 
                turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare 
                arm and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, 
                yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had 
                ever been to any man. Natasha kept turning to Helene and to her 
                father, as if asking what it all meant, but Helene was engaged 
                in conversation with a general and did not answer her look, and 
                her father's eyes said nothing but what they always said: &quot;Having 
                a good time? Well, I'm glad of it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole's 
                prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natasha, 
                to break the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked 
                the question and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking 
                to him she was doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though 
                to encourage her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At first I did not like it much, because what makes 
                a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes,* isn't that so? But 
                now I like it very much indeed,&quot; he said, looking at her 
                significantly. &quot;You'll come to the costume tournament, Countess? 
                Do come!&quot; and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping 
                his voice, he added, &quot;You will be the prettiest there. Do 
                come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*Are the pretty women. </p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than 
                he did himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had 
                an improper intention. She did not know what to say and turned 
                away as if she had not heard his remark. But as soon as she had 
                turned away she felt that he was there, behind, so close behind 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?&quot; 
                she asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. 
                She looked straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, 
                and the good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She 
                smiled just as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And 
                again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. 
                Natasha went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive 
                to the world she found herself in. All that was going on before 
                her now seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous 
                thoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the 
                country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging 
                to a remote past.</p>
              <p> 　　In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving 
                his arm about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and 
                he disappeared down below. That was the only part of the fourth 
                act that Natasha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the 
                cause of this was Kuragin whom she could not help watching. As 
                they were leaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called 
                their carriage, and helped them in. As he was putting Natasha 
                in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she 
                turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes, smiling 
                tenderly. </p>
              <p> 　　Only after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to 
                think over what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering 
                Prince Andrew she was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat 
                down after the opera, she gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and 
                ran out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O God! I am lost!&quot; she said to herself. &quot;How 
                could I let him?&quot; She sat for a long time hiding her flushed 
                face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her, 
                but was unable either to understand what had happened or what 
                she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure, and terrible. There 
                in that enormous, illuminated theater where the bare-legged Duport, 
                in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the music on wet 
                boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly naked Helene 
                with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried &quot;bravo!&quot;- 
                there in the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear and 
                simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible. &quot;What 
                is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing 
                of conscience I am feeling now?&quot; she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have 
                told all she was feeling. She knew that Sonya with her severe 
                and simple views would either not understand it at all or would 
                be horrified at such a confession. So Natasha tried to solve what 
                was torturing her by herself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Am I spoiled for Andrew's love or not?&quot; she asked 
                herself, and with soothing irony replied: &quot;What a fool I 
                am to ask that! What did happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, 
                I didn't lead him on at all. Nobody will know and I shall never 
                see him again,&quot; she told herself. &quot;So it is plain that 
                nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew 
                can love me still. But why 'still?' O God, why isn't he here?&quot; 
                Natasha quieted herself for a moment, but again some instinct 
                told her that though all this was true, and though nothing had 
                happened, yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew 
                had perished. And again in imagination she went over her whole 
                conversation with Kuragin, and again saw the face, gestures, and 
                tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.

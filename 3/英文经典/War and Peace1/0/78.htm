              <p> 　　Rostov's share in Dolokhov's duel with Bezukhov was hushed 
                up by the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded 
                to the ranks as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the 
                governor general of Moscow. As a result he could not go to the 
                country with the rest of the family, but was kept all summer in 
                Moscow by his new duties. Dolokhov recovered, and Rostov became 
                very friendly with him during his convalescence. Dolokhov lay 
                ill at his mother's who loved him passionately and tenderly, and 
                old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond of Rostov for his friendship 
                to her Fedya, often talked to him about her son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Count,&quot; she would say, &quot;he is too noble 
                and pure-souled for our present, depraved world. No one now loves 
                virtue; it seems like a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, 
                was it right, was it honorable, of Bezukhov? And Fedya, with his 
                noble spirit, loved him and even now never says a word against 
                him. Those pranks in Petersburg when they played some tricks on 
                a policeman, didn't they do it together? And there! Bezukhov got 
                off scotfree, while Fedya had to bear the whole burden on his 
                shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through! It's true he has been 
                reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there 
                were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as 
                he. And now- this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honor? 
                Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! 
                It's well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn't 
                have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things 
                he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months. 
                And then to call him out, reckoning on Fedya not fighting because 
                he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand 
                Fedya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of 
                you. Few people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly 
                soul!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostov 
                in a way no one would have expected of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know people consider me a bad man!&quot; he said. 
                &quot;Let them! I don't care a straw about anyone but those I 
                love; but those I love, I love so that I would give my life for 
                them, and the others I'd throttle if they stood in my way. I have 
                an adored, a priceless mother, and two or three friends- you among 
                them- and as for the rest I only care about them in so far as 
                they are harmful or useful. And most of them are harmful, especially 
                the women. Yes, dear boy,&quot; he continued, &quot;I have met 
                loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women- 
                countesses or cooks- who were not venal. I have not yet met that 
                divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such 
                a one I'd give my life for her! But those!... and he made a gesture 
                of contempt. &quot;And believe me, if I still value my life it 
                is only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who 
                will regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you don't understand 
                it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, I quite understand, &quot;answered Rostov, 
                who was under his new friend's influence.</p>
              <p> 　　In the autumn the Rostovs returned to Moscow. Early in the 
                winter Denisov also came back and stayed with them. The first 
                half of the winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, 
                was one of the happiest, merriest times for him and the whole 
                family. Nicholas brought many young men to his parents' house. 
                Vera was a handsome girl of twenty; Sonya a girl of sixteen with 
                all the charm of an opening flower; Natasha, half grown up and 
                half child, was now childishly amusing, now girlishly enchanting.</p>
              <p> 　　At that time in the Rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous 
                atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young 
                and very charming girls. Every young man who came to the house- 
                seeing those impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably 
                at their own happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, 
                and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent 
                but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full 
                of hope- experienced the same feeling; sharing with the young 
                folk of the Rostovs' household a readiness to fall in love and 
                an expectation of happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first 
                was Dolokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha. 
                She almost quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted 
                that he was a bad man, and that in the duel with Bezukhov, Pierre 
                was right and Dolokhov wrong, and further that he was disagreeable 
                and unnatural.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's nothing for me to understand,&quot; cried out 
                with resolute self-will, &quot;he is wicked and heartless. There 
                now, I like your Denisov though he is a rake and all that, still 
                I like him; so you see I do understand. I don't know how to put 
                it... with this one everything is calculated, and I don't like 
                that. But Denisov...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Denisov is quite different,&quot; replied Nicholas, 
                implying that even Denisov was nothing compared to Dolokhov- &quot;you 
                must understand what a soul there is in Dolokhov, you should see 
                him with his mother. What a heart!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I don't know about that, but I am uncomfortable 
                with him. And do you know he has fallen in love with Sonya?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What nonsense...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm certain of it; you'll see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's prediction proved true. Dolokhov, who did not usually 
                care for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, 
                and the question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of 
                it) was soon settled. He came because of Sonya. And Sonya, though 
                she would never have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet 
                every time Dolokhov appeared.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov often dined at the Rostovs', never missed a performance 
                at which they were present, and went to Iogel's balls for young 
                people which the Rostovs always attended. He was pointedly attentive 
                to Sonya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she 
                not bear his glances without coloring, but even the old countess 
                and Natasha blushed when they saw his looks.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the 
                irresistible influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov noticed something new in Dolokhov's relations with 
                Sonya, but he did not explain to himself what these new relations 
                were. &quot;They're always in love with someone,&quot; he thought 
                of Sonya and Natasha. But he was not as much at ease with Sonya 
                and Dolokhov as before and was less frequently at home.</p>
              <p> 　　In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of 
                the war with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. 
                Orders were given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand 
                for the regular army, and besides this, nine men in every thousand 
                for the militia. Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in 
                Moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of. For the Rostov 
                family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in 
                the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow, 
                and only awaited the termination of Denisov's furlough after Christmas 
                to return with him to their regiment. His approaching departure 
                did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather gave zest to his 
                pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away from home, 
                at dinners, parties, and balls.</p>

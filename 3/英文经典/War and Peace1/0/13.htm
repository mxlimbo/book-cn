              <p> 　　When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as 
                far as the conservatory. There she paused and stood listening 
                to the conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Boris to 
                come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, 
                ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young 
                man's discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At 
                this Natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed 
                a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to 
                a mirror examined his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered 
                out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood 
                a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the 
                other door. Natasha was about to call him but changed her mind. 
                &quot;Let him look for me,&quot; thought she. Hardly had Boris 
                gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came 
                in at the other door. Natasha checked her first impulse to run 
                out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching- as under 
                an invisible cap- to see what went on in the world. She was experiencing 
                a new and peculiar pleasure. Sonya, muttering to herself, kept 
                looking round toward the drawing-room door. It opened and Nicholas 
                came in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, what is the matter with you? How can you?&quot; 
                said he, running up to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!&quot; sobbed 
                Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, I know what it is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go 
                back to her!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself 
                like that, for a mere fancy?&quot; said Nicholas taking her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natasha, 
                not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with 
                sparkling eyes. &quot;What will happen now?&quot; thought she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone 
                are everything!&quot; said Nicholas. &quot;And I will prove it 
                to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't like you to talk like that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, Sonya!&quot; He 
                drew her to him and kissed her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how nice,&quot; thought Natasha; and when Sonya 
                and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and 
                called Boris to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Boris, come here,&quot; said she with a sly and significant 
                look. &quot;I have something to tell you. Here, here!&quot; and 
                she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs 
                where she had been hiding.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris followed her, smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the something?&quot; asked he.</p>
              <p> 　　She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she 
                had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kiss the doll,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but 
                did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you want to? Well, then, come here,&quot; said 
                she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. 
                &quot;Closer, closer!&quot; she whispered.</p>
              <p> 　　She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity 
                and fear appeared on her flushed face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And me? Would you like to kiss me?&quot; she whispered 
                almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, 
                and almost crying from excitement.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris blushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How funny you are!&quot; he said, bending down to her 
                and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced 
                him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, 
                and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side 
                of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha,&quot; he said, &quot;you know that I love you, 
                but...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are in love with me?&quot; Natasha broke in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... 
                In another four years... then I will ask for your hand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha considered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,&quot; she counted 
                on her slender little fingers. &quot;All right! Then it's settled?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Settled!&quot; replied Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forever?&quot; said the little girl. &quot;Till death 
                itself?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into 
                the adjoining sitting room. </p>

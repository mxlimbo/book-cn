              <p> 　　When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasili and his son were 
                already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and 
                Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, 
                treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, 
                said: &quot;Voila Marie!&quot; Princess Mary saw them all and 
                saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasili's face, serious for 
                an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, 
                and the little princess curiously noting the impression &quot;Marie&quot; 
                produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look 
                which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw 
                something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as 
                she entered the room. Prince Vasili approached first, and she 
                kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered 
                his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him 
                quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see 
                him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched 
                with her lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown 
                hair smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck 
                by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button 
                of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly 
                swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with 
                beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not 
                thinking about her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready 
                or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable 
                in society, of composure and imperturbable self-possession. If 
                a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction 
                and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence 
                and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But 
                Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess' 
                hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a 
                very long time. &quot;If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, 
                let him talk, but I don't want to&quot;' he seemed to say. Besides 
                this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly 
                inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love- a supercilious 
                consciousness of his own superiority. It was was as if he said 
                to them: &quot;I know you, I know you, but why should I bother 
                about you? You'd be only too glad, of course.&quot; Perhaps he 
                did not really think this when he met women- even probably he 
                did not, for in general he thought very little- but his looks 
                and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as 
                if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest 
                him, she turned to his father. The conversation was general and 
                animated, thanks to Princess Lise's voice and little downy lip 
                that lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasili with that 
                playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting 
                in the assumption that between the person they so address and 
                themselves there are some semi-private, long-established jokes 
                and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really 
                exist- just as none existed in this case. Prince Vasili readily 
                adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom 
                she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that 
                had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and 
                even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these 
                merry reminiscences.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company 
                all to ourselves, dear prince,&quot; said the little princess 
                (of course, in French) to Prince Vasili. &quot;It's not as at 
                Annette's* receptions where you always ran away; you remember 
                cette chere Annette!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*Anna Pavlovna. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, but you won't talk politics to me like Annette!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And our little tea table?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is it you were never at Annette's?&quot; the little 
                princess asked Anatole. &quot;Ah, I know, I know,&quot; she said 
                with a sly glance, &quot;your brother Hippolyte told me about 
                your goings on. Oh!&quot; and she shook her finger at him, &quot;I 
                have even heard of your doings in Paris!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And didn't Hippolyte tell you?&quot; asked Prince Vasili, 
                turning to his son and seizing the little princess' arm as if 
                she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her, 
                &quot;didn't he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear 
                princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a pearl 
                among women, Princess,&quot; he added, turning to Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part 
                seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.</p>
              <p> 　　She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since 
                Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole 
                answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with 
                a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the 
                pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he 
                would not find Bald Hills dull either. &quot;Not at all bad!&quot; 
                he thought, examining her, &quot;not at all bad, that little companion! 
                I hope she will bring her along with her when we're married, la 
                petite est gentille.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*The little one is charming. </p>
              <p> 　　The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and 
                considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed 
                him. &quot;What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince 
                Vasili is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine 
                specimen,&quot; he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that 
                the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled 
                question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always 
                deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring 
                himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The 
                prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand 
                that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not 
                only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. 
                Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, 
                was unthinkable to him. &quot;And why should she marry?&quot; 
                he thought. &quot;To be unhappy for certain. There's Lise, married 
                to Andrew- a better husband one would think could hardly be found 
                nowadays- but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry 
                Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They'll take her for her connections 
                and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the 
                happier for it?&quot; So thought Prince Bolkonski while dressing, 
                and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate 
                answer. Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident intention 
                of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for 
                an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. &quot;Well, 
                I've nothing against it,&quot; the prince said to himself, &quot;but 
                he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!&quot; 
                he added aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing 
                rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little 
                princess' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's 
                unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, 
                and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. 
                &quot;Got herself up like a fool!&quot; he thought, looking irritably 
                at her. &quot;She is shameless, and he ignores her!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He went straight up to Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to see you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Friendship laughs at distance,&quot; began Prince Vasili 
                in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. &quot;Here 
                is my second son; please love and befriend him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!&quot; he said. 
                &quot;Well, come and kiss me,&quot; and he offered his cheek.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity 
                and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities 
                his father had told him to expect.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner 
                of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasili, pointed 
                to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. 
                He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but 
                kept glancing at Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so they are writing from Potsdam already?&quot; 
                he said, repeating Prince Vasili's last words. Then rising, he 
                suddenly went up to his daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it for visitors you've got yourself up like that, 
                eh?&quot; said he. &quot;Fine, very fine! You have done up your 
                hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors 
                I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your 
                way of dress without my consent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was my fault, mon pere,&quot; interceded the little 
                princess, with a blush.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You must do as you please,&quot; said Prince Bolkonski, 
                bowing to his daughter-in-law, &quot;but she need not make a fool 
                of herself, she's plain enough as it is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, 
                who was reduced to tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very 
                well,&quot; said Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now you, young prince, what's your name?&quot; said 
                Prince Bolkonski, turning to Anatole, &quot;come here, let us 
                talk and get acquainted.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now the fun begins,&quot; thought Anatole, sitting down 
                with a smile beside the old prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been educated abroad, 
                not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and 
                me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?&quot; 
                asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I have been transferred to the line,&quot; said 
                Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! That's a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to 
                serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow 
                must serve. Well, are you off to the front?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but 
                I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?&quot; said 
                Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I attached to!' 
                Ha, ha, ha!&quot; laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed 
                still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolkonski frowned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You may go,&quot; he said to Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so you've had him educated abroad, Prince Vasili, 
                haven't you?&quot; said the old prince to Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the 
                education there is much better than ours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is 
                changed. The lad's a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with 
                me now.&quot; He took Prince Vasili's arm and led him to his study. 
                As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vasili announced his 
                hopes and wishes to the old prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can't 
                part from her?&quot; said the old prince angrily. &quot;What an 
                idea! I'm ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want 
                to know my son-in-law better. You know my principles- everything 
                aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she is 
                willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I'll see.&quot; 
                The old prince snorted. &quot;Let her marry, it's all the same 
                to me!&quot; he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting 
                from his son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will tell you frankly,&quot; said Prince Vasili in 
                the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning 
                with so keen-sighted companion. &quot;You know, you see right 
                through people. Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted 
                lad; an excellent son or kinsman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right, we'll see!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length 
                of time without male society, on Anatole's appearance all the 
                three women of Prince Bolkonski's household felt that their life 
                had not been real till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, 
                and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which 
                seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by 
                a new brightness, full of significance.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. 
                The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband 
                absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, 
                manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands 
                of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. 
                She drove them away and tried to conceal them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But am I not too cold with him?&quot; thought the princess. 
                &quot;I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel 
                too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think 
                of him and may imagine that I do not like him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial 
                to her new guest. &quot;Poor girl, she's devilish ugly!&quot; 
                thought Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by 
                Anatole's arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome 
                young woman without any definite position, without relations or 
                even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince 
                Bolkonski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess 
                Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian 
                prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to 
                the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall 
                in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian 
                prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt 
                but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. 
                It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her 
                poor mother (sa pauvre mere) appeared, and reproached her for 
                yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story 
                to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. 
                He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear and 
                he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne's head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about 
                Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even 
                for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long 
                been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just 
                grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him 
                as much as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the 
                trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared 
                for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive 
                or any struggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.</p>
              <p> 　　Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role 
                of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered 
                by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides 
                that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative 
                Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was 
                apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the 
                coarsest and most reckless actions.</p>
              <p> 　　After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess 
                Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and 
                in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and 
                beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with 
                a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into 
                a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her 
                made that world still more poetic. But Anatole's expression, though 
                his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements 
                of Mademoiselle Bourienne's little foot, which he was then touching 
                with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was 
                also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was 
                a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How she loves me!&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;How 
                happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and 
                such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?&quot; she thought, 
                not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing 
                at her.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, 
                Anatole kissed Princess Mary's hand. She did not know how she 
                found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face 
                as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess 
                Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand. (This 
                was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with 
                such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the 
                princess a frightened look.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What delicacy! &quot; thought the princess. &quot;Is 
                it possible that Amelie&quot; (Mademoiselle Bourienne) &quot;thinks 
                I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and 
                devotion to me?&quot; She went up to her and kissed her warmly. 
                Anatole went up to kiss the little princess' hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that 
                you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till 
                then!&quot; she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she 
                left the room. </p>

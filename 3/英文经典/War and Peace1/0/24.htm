              <p> 　　There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasili 
                and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of 
                Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre 
                and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw 
                the princess hide something as she whispered:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't bear the sight of that woman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,&quot; 
                said Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna. &quot;Go and take something, 
                my poor Anna Mikhaylovna, or you will not hold out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic 
                squeeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna 
                into the small drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night 
                as a cup of this delicious Russian tea,&quot; Lorrain was saying 
                with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from 
                a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea 
                and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room. Around 
                the table all who were at Count Bezukhov's house that night had 
                gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this small 
                circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During 
                balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, 
                had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they 
                passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls 
                on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly 
                lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. 
                Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small 
                table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the 
                middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, 
                but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement 
                that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was 
                about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though 
                he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his 
                monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception 
                room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest princess. 
                Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short 
                interval followed her. Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside the 
                princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what 
                is not necessary,&quot; said the younger of the two speakers, 
                evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed 
                the door of her room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, my dear princess,&quot; answered Anna Mikhaylovna 
                blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and 
                preventing the other from passing, &quot;won't this be too much 
                for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation 
                at a moment when his soul is already prepared...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar 
                attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, 
                which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching 
                violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what 
                the two ladies were saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she 
                pleases. You know how fond the count is of her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't even know what is in this paper,&quot; said 
                the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasili and pointing 
                to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. &quot;All I know 
                is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper 
                he has forgotten....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna, but the latter sprang 
                so as to bar her path.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know, my dear, kind princess,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna, 
                seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not 
                let go easily. &quot;Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have 
                some pity on him! Je vous en conjure...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle 
                for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident 
                that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering 
                to Anna Mikhaylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her 
                voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out 
                of place in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why don't you speak, cousin?&quot; suddenly shrieked 
                the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her 
                and were startled. &quot;Why do you remain silent when heaven 
                knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the 
                very threshold of a dying man's room? Intriguer!&quot; she hissed 
                viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.</p>
              <p> 　　But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her 
                hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili rose. &quot;Oh!&quot; said he with reproach 
                and surprise, &quot;this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess let go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you too!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. 
                I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Prince,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna, &quot;after 
                such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, 
                tell them your opinion,&quot; said she, turning to the young man 
                who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at 
                the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and 
                at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Remember that you will answer for the consequences,&quot; 
                said Prince Vasili severely. &quot;You don't know what you are 
                doing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vile woman!&quot; shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly 
                at Anna Mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched 
                so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily 
                open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three 
                sisters rushed out wringing her hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you doing!&quot; she cried vehemently. &quot;He 
                is dying and you leave me alone with him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping, 
                quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. 
                The eldest princess and Prince Vasili, recovering themselves, 
                followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with 
                a pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre 
                her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, now you may be glad!&quot; said she; &quot;this 
                is what you have been waiting for.&quot; And bursting into tears 
                she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili came next. He staggered to the sofa on which 
                Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with 
                his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered 
                and shook as if in an ague.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my friend!&quot; said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; 
                and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had 
                never observed in it before. &quot;How often we sin, how much 
                we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend... 
                I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful...&quot; and 
                he burst into tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with 
                slow, quiet steps.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pierre!&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man 
                on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause 
                she said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is no more....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives 
                such relief as tears.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad 
                no one could see his face. Anna Mikhaylovna left him, and when 
                she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to 
                speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are 
                now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not 
                yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will 
                not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must 
                be a man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if 
                I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! 
                You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not 
                to forget Boris. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you 
                will carry out your father's wish?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked 
                in silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, 
                Anna Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs' and went to bed. On 
                waking in the morning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances 
                the details of Count Bezukhov's death. She said the count had 
                died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only 
                touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and 
                son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without 
                tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those 
                awful moments- the father who so remembered everything and everybody 
                at last and last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, 
                or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he 
                with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden 
                his dying father. &quot;It is painful, but it does one good. It 
                uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy 
                son,&quot; said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and 
                Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as 
                a great secret.</p>

              <p> 　　After the definite refusal he had received, Petya went to 
                his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he 
                came in to tea, silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody 
                pretended not to notice anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the 
                Rostovs' domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look 
                at him. That morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging 
                his hair and collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before 
                his looking glass, gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, 
                without saying a word to anyone, took his cap and left the house 
                by the back door, trying to avoid notice. Petya decided to go 
                straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to some 
                gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded 
                by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostov, in spite of his 
                youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be no hindrance 
                to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing, Petya 
                had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.</p>
              <p> 　　It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted 
                for success in reaching the Emperor- he even thought how surprised 
                everyone would be at his youthfulness- and yet in the arrangement 
                of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished 
                to appear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more 
                his attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving 
                toward the Kremlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness 
                and deliberation of a man. As he approached the Kremlin he even 
                began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows 
                in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed 
                to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic 
                intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination 
                he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in, rumbling 
                beneath the archway. Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a footman, 
                two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some time 
                in the gateway, Petya tried to move forward in front of the others 
                without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely 
                working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of 
                him, who was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily 
                shouted at him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don't you 
                see we're all standing still? Then why push?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anybody can shove,&quot; said the footman, and also 
                began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed Petya into 
                a very filthy corner of the gateway.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled 
                up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem 
                like a man's.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that 
                if he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight 
                he would not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible 
                to smarten oneself up or move to another place, because of the 
                crowd. One of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance 
                of the Rostovs', and Petya thought of asking his help, but came 
                to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do. 
                When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd, carrying Petya 
                with it, streamed forward into the Kremlin Square which was already 
                full of people. There were people not only in the square, but 
                everywhere- on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Petya found 
                himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and 
                the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Kremlin.</p>
              <p> 　　For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads 
                were bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Petya 
                was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody 
                shouted, &quot;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&quot; Petya stood on tiptoe 
                and pushed and pinched, but could see nothing except the people 
                about him.</p>
              <p> 　　All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. 
                A tradesman's wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the tears 
                ran down her cheeks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father! Angel! Dear one!&quot; she kept repeating, wiping 
                away her tears with her fingers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah!&quot; was heard on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another 
                rush forward.</p>
              <p> 　　Quite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling 
                his eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting 
                &quot;hurrah!&quot; as if he were prepared that instant to kill 
                himself and everyone else, but on both sides of him other people 
                with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted 
                &quot;hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So this is what the Emperor is!&quot; thought Petya. 
                &quot;No, I can't petition him myself- that would be too bold.&quot; 
                But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward, 
                and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses 
                of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it; but 
                just then the crowd swayed back- the police in front were pushing 
                back those who had pressed too close to the procession: the Emperor 
                was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption- 
                and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs 
                and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before 
                his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a 
                man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back 
                of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock- probably a church 
                clerk and chanter- was holding him under the arm with one hand 
                while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You've crushed the young gentleman!&quot; said the clerk. 
                &quot;What are you up to? Gently!... They've crushed him, crushed 
                him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd 
                spread out again more evenly, and the clerk led Petya- pale and 
                breathless- to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for 
                Petya, and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round 
                him. Those who stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his 
                coat, seated him on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached 
                those others (whoever they might be) who had crushed him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean 
                by it? Killing people! Poor dear, he's as white as a sheet!&quot;- 
                various voices were heard saying.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, 
                the pain had passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness 
                he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see 
                the Emperor who would be returning that way. Petya no longer thought 
                of presenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he 
                would be happy!</p>
              <p> 　　While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption- 
                it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor's 
                arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the 
                Turks- the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling 
                kvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was particularly 
                fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman's 
                wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the 
                shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now 
                got dear. The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary 
                about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. 
                The clerk several times used the word &quot;plenary&quot; (of 
                the service), a word Petya did not understand. Two young citizens 
                were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these 
                conversations, especially the joking with the girls, were such 
                as might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age, but 
                they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation- the pedestal 
                of the cannon- still agitated as before by the thought of the 
                Emperor and by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear 
                he had experienced when he was being crushed, together with that 
                of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the importance 
                of the occasion.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the 
                embankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, 
                and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch 
                the firing. Petya too would have run there, but the clerk who 
                had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him. 
                The firing was still proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting 
                came running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a 
                more leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had 
                run to look at the cannon ran back again. At last four men in 
                uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. &quot;Hurrah! 
                hurrah!&quot; shouted the crowd again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which is he? Which?&quot; asked Petya in a tearful voice, 
                of those around him, but no one answered him, everybody was too 
                excited; and Petya, fixing on one of those four men, whom he could 
                not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated 
                all his enthusiasm on him- though it happened not to be the Emperor- 
                frantically shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and resolved that tomorrow, 
                come what might, he would join the army.</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, 
                and began to disperse. It was already late, and Petya had not 
                eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did 
                not go home but stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, 
                crowd before the palace while the Emperor dined- looking in at 
                the palace windows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike 
                the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the 
                Emperor and the court footmen who served at table, glimpses of 
                whom could be seen through the windows.</p>
              <p> 　　While the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window, 
                said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, 
                rose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Petya among 
                them, rushed toward the balcony.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...&quot; cried the 
                crowd, and Petya with it, and again the women and men of weaker 
                mold, Petya among them, wept with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in 
                his hand broke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the 
                ground. A coachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward 
                and snatched it up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the 
                coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought 
                him and began throwing them down from the balcony. Petya's eyes 
                grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the danger of being 
                crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why, but he 
                had to have a biscuit from the Tsar's hand and he felt that he 
                must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who 
                was catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself 
                defeated though she was lying on the ground- she grabbed at some 
                biscuits but her hand did not reach them. Petya pushed her hand 
                away with his knee, seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be 
                too late, again shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; with a voice already 
                hoarse.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the 
                crowd began to disperse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! I said if only we waited- and so it was!&quot; 
                was being joyfully said by various people.</p>
              <p> 　　Happy as Petya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing 
                that all the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight 
                home from the Kremlin, but called on his friend Obolenski, who 
                was fifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home 
                Petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed 
                to enter the service he would run away. And next day, Count Ilya 
                Rostov- though he had not yet quite yielded- went to inquire how 
                he could arrange for Petya to serve where there would be least 
                danger. </p>

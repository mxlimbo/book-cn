              <p> 　　On the thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, 1809 - 10 
                an old grandee of Catherine's day was giving a ball and midnight 
                supper. The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be 
                present.</p>
              <p> 　　The grandee's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered 
                with innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly 
                lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes 
                but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself 
                stood at the porch. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones 
                arriving, with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats. 
                From the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, 
                while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage 
                steps which were let down for them with a clatter, and then walked 
                hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.</p>
              <p> 　　Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through 
                the crowd and caps were doffed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor?... No, a minister.... prince... ambassador. 
                Don't you see the plumes?...&quot; was whispered among the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone 
                and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.</p>
              <p> 　　A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, 
                who were to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.</p>
              <p> 　　There had been many discussions and preparations for this 
                ball in the Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would 
                not arrive, that the dresses would not be ready, or that something 
                would not be arranged as it should be.</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor 
                at the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation 
                of the countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg 
                high society, was to accompany them to the ball.</p>
              <p> 　　They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens 
                at ten o'clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the 
                girls were not yet dressed.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up 
                at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and 
                activity all day. All her powers since morning had been concentrated 
                on ensuring that they all- she herself, Mamma, and Sonya- should 
                be as well dressed as possible. Sonya and her mother put themselves 
                entirely in her hands. The countess was to wear a claret-colored 
                velvet dress, and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, 
                with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, 
                and ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the 
                openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were 
                already on; the hairdressing was almost done. Sonya was finishing 
                dressing and so was the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled 
                about helping them all, was behindhand. She was still sitting 
                before a looking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her 
                slender shoulders. Sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of 
                the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty 
                finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went 
                through it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's not the way, that's not the way, Sonya!&quot; 
                cried Natasha turning her head and clutching with both hands at 
                her hair which the maid who was dressing it had not time to release. 
                &quot;That bow is not right. Come here!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya sat down and Natasha pinned the ribbon on differently.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Allow me, Miss! I can't do it like that,&quot; said 
                the maid who was holding Natasha's hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That's right, Sonya.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aren't you ready? It is nearly ten,&quot; came the countess' 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have only my cap to pin on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't do it without me!&quot; called Natasha. &quot;You 
                won't do it right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's already ten.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten, and Natasha 
                had still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.</p>
              <p> 　　When her hair was done, Natasha, in her short petticoat from 
                under which her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother's dressing 
                jacket, ran up to Sonya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her 
                mother. Turning her mother's head this way and that, she fastened 
                on the cap and, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the 
                maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt.</p>
              <p> 　　The cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, which was too 
                long. Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off 
                the ends of thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running 
                about between the countess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole 
                of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mavra, quicker, darling!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whenever will you be ready?&quot; asked the count coming 
                to the door. &quot;Here is here is some scent. Peronskaya must 
                be tired of waiting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's ready, Miss,&quot; said the maid, holding up the 
                shortened gauze dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking 
                something off it, as if by this to express a consciousness of 
                the airiness and purity of what she held.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha began putting on the dress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In a minute! In a minute! Don't come in, Papa!&quot; 
                she cried to her father as he opened the door- speaking from under 
                the filmy skirt which still covered her whole face.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count 
                in. He was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, 
                and was perfumed and his hair pomaded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!&quot; cried Natasha, 
                as she stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds 
                of the gauze.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you please, Miss! allow me,&quot; said the maid, 
                who on her knees was pulling the skirt straight and shifting the 
                pins from one side of her mouth to the other with her tongue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Say what you like,&quot; exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing 
                voice as she looked at Natasha, &quot;say what you like, it's 
                still too long.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. 
                The dress was too long.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really, madam, it is not at all too long,&quot; said 
                Mavra, crawling on her knees after her young lady.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, if it's too long we'll take it up... we'll tack 
                it up in one minute,&quot; said the resolute Dunyasha taking a 
                needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still 
                kneeling on the floor, set to work once more.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, 
                in her cap and velvet gown.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oo-oo, my beauty!&quot; exclaimed the count, &quot;she 
                looks better than any of you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside 
                fearing to be rumpled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, your cap, more to this side,&quot; said Natasha. 
                &quot;I'll arrange it,&quot; and she rushed forward so that the 
                maids who were tacking up her skirt could not move fast enough 
                and a piece of gauze was torn off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my 
                fault!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind, I'll run it up, it won't show,&quot; said 
                Dunyasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a beauty- a very queen!&quot; said the nurse as 
                she came to the door. &quot;And Sonya! They are lovely!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages 
                and started. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.</p>
              <p> 　　Peronskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness 
                she had gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with 
                less flurry- for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old 
                body was washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. 
                She had washed behind her ears just as carefully, and when she 
                entered her drawing room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge 
                as maid of honor, her old lady's maid was as full of rapturous 
                admiration as the Rostovs' servants had been.</p>
              <p> 　　She praised the Rostovs' toilets. They praised her taste and 
                toilet, and at eleven o'clock, careful of their coiffures and 
                dresses, they settled themselves in their carriages and drove 
                off. </p>

              <p> 　　Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning 
                to Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found 
                himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. 
                He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, 
                and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic 
                charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented 
                as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which 
                the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported 
                almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations 
                and dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though 
                he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the 
                temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved.</p>
              <p> 　　Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, 
                Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly 
                he tried to rest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he 
                stood gave way under him. At the same time he felt that the deeper 
                the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became 
                to the order. When he had joined the Freemasons he had experienced 
                the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface 
                of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To make quite 
                sure of the firmness the ground, he put his other foot down and 
                sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded 
                knee-deep in the bog.</p>
              <p> 　　Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg- he had of late stood 
                aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost 
                entirely in Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre 
                knew in ordinary life, and it was difficult for him to regard 
                them merely as Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or 
                Ivan Vasilevich D., whom he knew in society mostly as weak and 
                insignificant men. Under the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw 
                the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life. 
                Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up twenty to thirty 
                rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members, 
                of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre remembered 
                the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his 
                belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to 
                dwell arose in his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the 
                first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs 
                of the lodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied 
                with the mystical science of the order: with questions of the 
                threefold designation of God, the three primordial elements- sulphur, 
                mercury, and salt- or the meaning of the square and all the various 
                figures of the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class 
                of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, 
                Pierre thought, Joseph Alexeevich himself, but he did not share 
                their interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others 
                like him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry 
                a straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) 
                who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, 
                and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling 
                about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even 
                the Grand Master of the principal lodge.</p>
              <p> 　　Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers 
                belonged, particularly those who had lately joined. These according 
                to Pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything, 
                nor desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate 
                with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their 
                connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. 
                Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to 
                him based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry 
                itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path 
                and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end 
                of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets 
                of the order.</p>
              <p> 　　In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons 
                knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov had obtained 
                the confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated 
                into many mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was 
                bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage 
                of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all 
                came to see him, tried to ingratiate themselves with him, and 
                it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them 
                and concealing it.</p>
              <p> 　　A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, 
                at which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers 
                what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their 
                order. The meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies 
                Pierre rose and began his address.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear Brothers,&quot; he began, blushing and stammering, 
                with a written speech in his hand, &quot;it is not sufficient 
                to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge- we must 
                act- act! We are drowsing, but we must act.&quot; Pierre raised 
                his notebook and began to read.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the 
                triumph of virtue,&quot; he read, &quot;we must cleanse men from 
                prejudice, diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the 
                times, undertake the education of the young, unite ourselves in 
                indissoluble bonds with the wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome 
                superstitions, infidelity, and folly, and form of those devoted 
                to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed 
                of authority and power.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of 
                virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man 
                may, even in this world, receive a lasting reward for his virtue. 
                But in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political 
                institutions of today. What is to be done in these circumstances? 
                To favor revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... 
                No! We are very far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, 
                for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, 
                and also because wisdom needs no violence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea 
                of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity 
                of conviction- aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and 
                patronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust 
                and attaching them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order 
                have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors 
                of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it. 
                In a word, we must found a form of government holding universal 
                sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying 
                the bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other governments 
                can continue in their customary course and do everything except 
                what impedes the great aim of our order, which is to obtain for 
                virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of Christianity 
                itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit 
                to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, 
                preaching alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth 
                endowed her with special strength, but now we need much more powerful 
                methods. It is now necessary that man, governed by his senses, 
                should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is 
                impossible to eradicate the passions; but we must strive to direct 
                them to a noble aim, and it is therefore necessary that everyone 
                should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue. 
                Our order should provide means to that end.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in 
                every state, each of them again training two others and all being 
                closely united, everything will be possible for our order, which 
                has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This speech not only made a strong impression, but created 
                excitement in the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing 
                in it dangerous designs of Illuminism,* met it with a coldness 
                that surprised Pierre. The Grand Master began answering him, and 
                Pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth. It 
                was long since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties were 
                formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting 
                him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless 
                variety of men's minds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting 
                itself identically to two persons. Even those members who seemed 
                to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations 
                and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted 
                most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood 
                it. </p>
              <p> 　　*The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical 
                institutions. </p>
              <p> 　　At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and 
                ill-will reproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not 
                love of virtue alone, but also a love of strife that had moved 
                him in the dispute. Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly 
                whether his proposal would be accepted. He was told that it would 
                not, and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the 
                lodge and went home. </p>

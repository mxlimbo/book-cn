              <p> 　　Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did 
                not dwell on it long. &quot;Yes, it was a very brilliant ball,&quot; 
                and then... &quot;Yes, that little Rostova is very charming. There's 
                something fresh, original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes 
                her.&quot; That was all he thought about yesterday's ball, and 
                after his morning tea he set to work.</p>
              <p> 　　But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed 
                for work and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own 
                work, as he often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.</p>
              <p> 　　The visitor was Bitski, who served on various committees, 
                frequented all the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee 
                of the new ideas and of Speranski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger- 
                one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes 
                according to the fashion, but who for that very reason appear 
                to be the warmest partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat 
                before he ran into Prince Andrew's room with a preoccupied air 
                and at once began talking. He had just heard particulars of that 
                morning's sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor, 
                and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor's speech had 
                been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as only constitutional 
                monarchs deliver. &quot;The Sovereign plainly said that the Council 
                and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the government 
                must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor said 
                that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published,&quot; 
                recounted Bitski, emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes 
                significantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, yes! Today's events mark an epoch, the greatest 
                epoch in our history,&quot; he concluded.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the 
                Council of State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which 
                he had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event, 
                now that it had taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed 
                quite insignificant. He listened with quiet irony to Bitski's 
                enthusiastic account of it. A very simple thought occurred to 
                him: &quot;What does it matter to me or to Bitski what the Emperor 
                was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me any happier 
                or better?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest 
                Prince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going 
                to dine that evening at Speranski's, &quot;with only a few friends,&quot; 
                as the host had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner 
                in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly 
                interested Prince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speranski 
                in his domestic surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go 
                to it.</p>
              <p> 　　At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house 
                Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining 
                room this small house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness 
                (suggesting that of a monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather 
                late, found the friendly gathering of Speranski's intimate acquaintances 
                already assembled at five o'clock. There were no ladies present 
                except Speranski's little daughter (long-faced like her father) 
                and her governess. The other guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and 
                Stolypin. While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud 
                voices and a ringing staccato laugh- a laugh such as one hears 
                on the stage. Someone- it sounded like Speranski- was distinctly 
                ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski's 
                famous laugh, and this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman 
                made a strange impression on him.</p>
              <p> 　　He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing 
                between two windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres. 
                Speranski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the 
                breast, and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white 
                stock he had worn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood 
                at the table with a beaming countenance. His guests surrounded 
                him. Magnitski, addressing himself to Speranski, was relating 
                an anecdote, and Speranski was laughing in advance at what Magnitski 
                was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnitski's 
                words were again crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep bass 
                guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed 
                softly with a hissing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-pitched 
                staccato manner.</p>
              <p> 　　Still laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand to 
                Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very pleased to see you, Prince,&quot; he said. &quot;One 
                moment...&quot; he went on, turning to Magnitski and interrupting 
                his story. &quot;We have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, 
                with not a word about business!&quot; and turning again to the 
                narrator he began to laugh afresh.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment, 
                regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not 
                Speranski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared 
                mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain 
                and unattractive.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and 
                seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. 
                Before Magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious 
                to relate something still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not 
                relating to the state service, related to people in the service. 
                It seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people 
                was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward 
                them was one of good humored ridicule. Speranski related how at 
                the Council that morning a deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, 
                replied that he thought so too. Gervais gave a long account of 
                an official revision, remarkable for the stupidity of everybody 
                concerned. Stolypin, stuttering, broke into the conversation and 
                began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former 
                order of things- threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation. 
                Magnitski starting quizzing Stolypin about his vehemence. Gervais 
                intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its former lively 
                tone.</p>
              <p> 　　Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find 
                amusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding 
                his wish, tried to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their 
                gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speranski's 
                high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and the incessant 
                laughter grated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not 
                laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the 
                company, but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony 
                with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.</p>
              <p> 　　He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his 
                remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of 
                the water, and he could not jest with them.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it 
                was witty and might have been funny, but it lacked just that something 
                which is the salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that 
                such a thing existed.</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner Speranski's daughter and her governess rose. 
                He patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. 
                And that gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　The men remained at table over their port- English fashion. 
                In the midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon's 
                Spanish affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew 
                began to express a contrary opinion. Speranski smiled and, with 
                an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant 
                course, told a story that had no connection with the previous 
                conversation. For a few moments all were silent.</p>
              <p> 　　Having sat some time at table, Speranski corked a bottle of 
                wine and, remarking, &quot;Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage 
                and pair,&quot; passed it to the servant and got up. All rose 
                and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room. Two 
                letters brought by a courier were handed to Speranski and he took 
                them to his study. As soon as he had left the room the general 
                merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and 
                quietly with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now for the recitation!&quot; said Speranski on returning 
                from his study. &quot;A wonderful talent!&quot; he said to Prince 
                Andrew, and Magnitski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting 
                some humorous verses in French which he had composed about various 
                well-known Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times 
                by applause. When the verses were finished Prince Andrew went 
                up to Speranski and took his leave.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you off to so early?&quot; asked Speranski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I promised to go to a reception.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those 
                mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous 
                of him to have expected anything from Speranski and from any of 
                his own activities connected with him, or ever to have attributed 
                importance to what Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless 
                laughter rang in Prince Andrew's ears long after he had left the 
                house.</p>
              <p> 　　When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life 
                in Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something 
                new. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history 
                of his project of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration 
                and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because 
                another, a very poor one, had already been prepared and submitted 
                to the Emperor. He thought of the meetings of a committee of which 
                Berg was a member. He remembered how carefully and at what length 
                everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those 
                meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to 
                the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on 
                the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles 
                of the Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed 
                of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Bogucharovo, his 
                occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan; he remembered 
                the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally applying 
                to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he 
                felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such 
                useless work. </p>

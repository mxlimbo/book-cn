              <p> 　　Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor 
                near the village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding 
                officer were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various 
                kinds. He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past 
                these crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they 
                were. The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with 
                caleches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers 
                of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole mass droned 
                and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon 
                balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen 
                Heights.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzov?&quot; Rostov 
                kept asking everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.</p>
              <p> 　　At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!&quot; said 
                the soldier, laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.</p>
              <p> 　　Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped 
                the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and 
                began to question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been 
                driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along 
                that very road and that he was dangerously wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It can't be!&quot; said Rostov. &quot;It must have been 
                someone else.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I saw him myself.&quot; replied the man with a self-confident 
                smile of derision. &quot;I ought to know the Emperor by now, after 
                the times I've seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see 
                you.... There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything. How 
                they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle 
                past! It's time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych. I 
                don't think Ilya drives anyone except the Tsar!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when 
                a wounded officer passing by addressed him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is it you want?&quot; he asked. &quot;The commander 
                in chief? He was killed by a cannon ball- struck in the breast 
                before our regiment.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not killed- wounded!&quot; another officer corrected 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who? Kutuzov?&quot; asked Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not Kutuzov, but what's his name- well, never mind... 
                there are not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all 
                the commanders are there,&quot; said the officer, pointing to 
                the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he 
                was now going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was 
                impossible to doubt it now. Rostov rode in the direction pointed 
                out to him, in which he saw turrets and a church. What need to 
                hurry? What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even 
                if they were alive and unwounded?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed 
                at once!&quot; a soldier shouted to him. &quot;They'd kill you 
                there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what are you talking about?&quot; said another. 
                &quot;Where is he to go? That way is nearer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov considered, and then went in the direction where they 
                said he would be killed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am 
                I to try to save myself?&quot; he thought. He rode on to the region 
                where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from 
                Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied that region, and the 
                Russians- the uninjured and slightly wounded- had left it long 
                ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, 
                lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. 
                The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear 
                their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned- or so 
                it seemed to Rostov. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing 
                all these suffering men, and he felt afraid- afraid not for his 
                life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not 
                stand the sight of these unfortunates.</p>
              <p> 　　The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with 
                dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing 
                an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several 
                shots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of 
                the corpses around him merged in Rostov's mind into a single feeling 
                of terror and pity for himself. He remembered his mother's last 
                letter. &quot;What would she feel,&quot; thought he, &quot;if 
                she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring 
                from the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were 
                less disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the 
                musketry fire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and 
                said that the battle was lost. No one whom Rostov asked could 
                tell him where the Emperor or Kutuzov was. Some said the report 
                that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, 
                and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that 
                the Emperor's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle 
                with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who 
                had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor's 
                suite. One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters 
                behind the village to the left, and thither Rostov rode, not hoping 
                to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had 
                ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian 
                troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two 
                men on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his 
                hat seemed familiar to Rostov; the other on a beautiful chestnut 
                horse (which Rostov fancied he had seen before) rode up to the 
                ditch, struck his horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein 
                leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled from the bank 
                under the horse's hind hoofs. Turning the horse sharply, he again 
                jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with 
                the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same. 
                The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily 
                riveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head 
                and hand and by that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented 
                and adored monarch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it can't be he, alone in the midst of this empty 
                field!&quot; thought Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned his 
                head and Rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved 
                on his memory. The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his 
                eyes hollow, but the charm, the mildness of his features, was 
                all the greater. Rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors 
                about the Emperor being wounded were false. He was happy to be 
                seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go straight 
                to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver.</p>
              <p> 　　But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not 
                utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around 
                for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment 
                comes and he is alone with her, so Rostov, now that he had attained 
                what he had longed for more than anything else in the world, did 
                not know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred 
                to him why it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible 
                to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage 
                of his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant 
                or painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can 
                I say to him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry 
                at the mere sight of him?&quot; Not one of the innumerable speeches 
                addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination 
                could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for quite other 
                conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment 
                of victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds 
                and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while 
                dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions 
                for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the 
                battle is lost? No, certainly I must not approach him, I must 
                not intrude on his reflections. Better die a thousand times than 
                risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him,&quot; Rostov 
                decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode 
                away, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still remained 
                in the same attitude of indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly 
                away, Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing 
                the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and 
                assisted him to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing 
                to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von 
                Toll remained beside him. Rostov from a distance saw with envy 
                and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor 
                and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes with 
                his hand and pressed von Toll's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I might have been in his place!&quot; thought Rostov, 
                and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode 
                on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.</p>
              <p> 　　His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own 
                weakness was the cause his grief.</p>
              <p> 　　He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the 
                sovereign. It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the 
                Emperor and he had not made use of it.... &quot;What have I done?&quot; 
                thought he. And he turned round and galloped back to the place 
                where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the 
                ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were passing by. From 
                one of the drivers he learned that Kutuzov's staff were not far 
                off, in the village the vehicles were going to. Rostov followed 
                them. In front of him walked Kutuzov's groom leading horses in 
                horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old, 
                bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tit! I say, Tit!&quot; said the groom.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot; answered the old man absent-mindedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you fool!&quot; said the old man, spitting angrily. 
                Some time passed in silence, and then the same joke was repeated. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all 
                points. More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of 
                the French.</p>
              <p> 　　Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other 
                columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly 
                confused masses.</p>
              <p> 　　The remains of Langeron's and Dokhturov's mingled forces were 
                crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village 
                of Augesd.</p>
              <p> 　　After five o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot 
                cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard 
                from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, 
                directed at our retreating forces.</p>
              <p> 　　In the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions 
                kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing 
                our troops. It was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where 
                for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in 
                his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with 
                shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fish 
                in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years 
                Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven 
                their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty 
                with flour whitening their carts- on that narrow dam amid the 
                wagons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and between the 
                wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, 
                crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing 
                one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves 
                in the same way.</p>
              <p> 　　Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, 
                or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some 
                and splashing with blood those near them.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov- now an officer- wounded in the arm, and on foot, 
                with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of 
                his company, represented all that was left of that whole regiment. 
                Impelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach 
                to the dam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a 
                horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging 
                it out. A cannon ball killed someone behind them, another fell 
                in front and splashed Dolokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing 
                forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and 
                again stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, 
                remain here another two minutes and it is certain death,&quot; 
                thought each one.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way 
                to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, 
                and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Turn this way!&quot; he shouted, jumping over the ice 
                which creaked under him; &quot;turn this way!&quot; he shouted 
                to those with the gun. &quot;It bears!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain 
                that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but 
                very soon even under his weight alone. The men looked at him and 
                pressed to the bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general 
                on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened 
                his mouth to address Dolokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so 
                low above the crowd that everyone ducked. It flopped into something 
                moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood. 
                Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don't you 
                hear? Go on!&quot; innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the 
                ball had struck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, 
                or why, they were shouting.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned 
                off onto the ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running 
                onto the frozen pond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost 
                soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tried to right 
                himself but fell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank 
                back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still 
                came the shouts: &quot;Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go 
                on!&quot; And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers 
                near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them 
                turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that 
                had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some 
                forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning 
                one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and 
                flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among 
                the crowd that covered the dam, the pond, and the bank. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not 
                altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little 
                princess was in her sister-in-law's room. Prince Andrew in a traveling 
                coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the 
                rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and 
                seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. 
                Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; 
                a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish 
                pistols and a saber- a present from his father who had brought 
                it from the siege of Ochakov. All these traveling effects of Prince 
                Andrew's were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers 
                carefully tied with tapes.</p>
              <p> 　　When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, 
                men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of 
                mind. At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. 
                Prince Andrew's face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his 
                hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the 
                room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his 
                head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his 
                wife?- perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen 
                in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly 
                unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover 
                of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable 
                expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hear you have given orders to harness,&quot; she cried, 
                panting (she had apparently been running), &quot;and I did so 
                wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we 
                may again be parted. You are not angry with me for coming? You 
                have changed so, Andrusha,&quot; she added, as if to explain such 
                a question.</p>
              <p> 　　She smiled as she uttered his pet name, &quot;Andrusha.&quot; 
                It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome 
                man should be Andrusha- the slender mischievous boy who had been 
                her playfellow in childhood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And where is Lise?&quot; he asked, answering her question 
                only by a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa 
                in my room. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,&quot; 
                said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother. &quot;She 
                is quite a child: such a dear, merry child. I have grown so fond 
                of her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical 
                and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free 
                from them, Andrew? Don't forget that she has grown up and been 
                educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. 
                We should enter into everyone's situation. Tout comprendre, c'est 
                tout pardonner.* Think it must be for her, poor thing, after what 
                she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left 
                alone the country, in her condition! It's very hard.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*To understand all is to forgive all. </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile 
                at those we think we thoroughly understand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You live in the country and don't think the life terrible,&quot; 
                he replied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I... that's different. Why speak of me? I don't want 
                any other life, and can't, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: 
                for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the 
                best years of her life, all alone- for Papa is always busy, and 
                I... well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining 
                a woman used to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she's 
                much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, 
                I don't need her, and she's even in my way. You know I always 
                was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... 
                Father likes her very much. She and Michael Ivanovich are the 
                two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has 
                been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: 'We don't love 
                people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good 
                we have done them.' Father took her when she was homeless after 
                losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father 
                likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and 
                reads splendidly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character 
                sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn't it?&quot; Prince 
                Andrew asked suddenly.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this 
                question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For me? For me?... Trying for me!...&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he's 
                getting very trying,&quot; said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking 
                lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind 
                of intellectual pride,&quot; said the princess, following the 
                train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation- 
                &quot;and that's a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even 
                if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man 
                as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. 
                I only wish you were all as happy as I am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her brother shook his head incredulously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you 
                the truth, Andrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects. 
                I don't understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail 
                to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That 
                is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can 
                see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter 
                of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk 
                with.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting 
                your powder,&quot; said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear 
                me. Andrew...&quot; she said timidly after a moment's silence, 
                &quot;I have a great favor to ask of you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it, dear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No- promise that you will not refuse! It will give you 
                no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort 
                me. Promise, Andrusha!...&quot; said she, putting her hand in 
                her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside 
                it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must 
                not be shown before the request was granted.</p>
              <p> 　　She looked timidly at her brother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Even if it were a great deal of trouble...&quot; answered 
                Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. 
                Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father's 
                father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars.&quot; (She still 
                did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) &quot;So 
                you promise?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course. What is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise 
                me you will never take it off. Do you promise?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break 
                my neck... To please you...&quot; said Prince Andrew. But immediately, 
                noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister's 
                face, he repented and added: &quot;I am glad; really, dear, I 
                am very glad.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Against your will He will save and have mercy on you 
                and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,&quot; 
                said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up 
                in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced 
                icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver 
                chain.</p>
              <p> 　　She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please, Andrew, for my sake!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those 
                eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. 
                Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew 
                understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look 
                of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on 
                his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you, my dear.&quot; She kissed him on the forehead 
                and sat down again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous 
                as you always used to be. Don't judge Lise harshly,&quot; she 
                began. &quot;She is so sweet, so good-natured, and her position 
                now is a very hard one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, 
                Masha, or blamed her. Why do you say all this to me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Red patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent 
                as if she felt guilty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have said nothing to you, but you have already been 
                talked to. And I am sorry for that,&quot; he went on.</p>
              <p> 　　The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. 
                She tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed 
                right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had 
                spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded 
                it, and had complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her 
                husband. After crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt 
                sorry for his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Know this, Masha: I can't reproach, have not reproached, 
                and never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach 
                myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be 
                so in whatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want 
                to know the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! 
                Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don't know...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, 
                kissed her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, 
                and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister 
                but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or- go and wake 
                and I'll come in a moment. Petrushka!&quot; he called to his valet: 
                &quot;Come here, take these away. Put this on the seat and this 
                to the right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and 
                said: &quot;Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to 
                God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your 
                prayer would have been answered.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, may be!&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Go, Masha; 
                I'll come immediately.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected 
                one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an 
                ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! I thought you were in your room,&quot; she said, 
                for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger 
                suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked 
                at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such 
                contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a 
                word. When he reached his sister's room his wife was already awake 
                and her merry voice, hurrying one word after another, came through 
                the open door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as if 
                after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, with false 
                curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying 
                to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh 
                Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence 
                of others some five times. He entered the room softly. The little 
                princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her 
                work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences 
                and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and 
                asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered him 
                and continued her chatter.</p>
              <p> 　　The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was 
                an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage 
                pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. 
                The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its 
                lofty windows. The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting 
                to bid good-by to the young prince. The members of the household 
                were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivanovich, Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew 
                had been called to his father's study as the latter wished to 
                say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them to come out.</p>
              <p> 　　When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age 
                spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one 
                but his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Going?&quot; And he went on writing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've come to say good-by.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kiss me here,&quot; and he touched his cheek: &quot;Thanks, 
                thanks!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you thank me for?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman's 
                apron strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!&quot; 
                And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. 
                &quot;If you have anything to say, say it. These two things can 
                be done together,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her 
                on your hands...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... 
                Let him be here....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, 
                fixed his stern eyes on his son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know that no one can help if nature does not do her 
                work,&quot; said Prince Andrew, evidently confused. &quot;I know 
                that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her 
                fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had 
                a dream and is frightened.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hm... Hm...&quot; muttered the old prince to himself, 
                finishing what he was writing. &quot;I'll do it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son 
                began to laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a bad business, eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is bad, Father?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The wife!&quot; said the old prince, briefly and significantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand!&quot; said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it can't be helped, lad,&quot; said the prince. 
                &quot;They're all like that; one can't unmarry. Don't be afraid; 
                I won't tell anyone, but you know it yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook 
                it, looked straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed 
                to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood 
                him. The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching 
                up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his 
                accustomed rapidity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do everything. 
                Make your mind easy,&quot; said he in abrupt sentences while sealing 
                his letter.</p>
              <p> 　　Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that 
                his father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter 
                to his son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Listen!&quot; said he; &quot;don't worry about your 
                wife: what can be done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter 
                to Michael Ilarionovich.* I have written that he should make use 
                of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: 
                a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write and tell 
                me how he receives you. If he is all right- serve him. Nicholas 
                Bolkonski's son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. 
                Now come here.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*Kutuzov. </p>
              <p> 　　He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, 
                but his son was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the 
                desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise 
                book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall probably die before you. So remember, these 
                are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here 
                is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who 
                writes a history of Suvorov's wars. Send it to the Academy. Here 
                are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find 
                them useful.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live 
                a long time yet. He felt that he must not say it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will do it all, Father,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now, good-by!&quot; He gave his son his hand to 
                kiss, and embraced him. &quot;Remember this, Prince Andrew, if 
                they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...&quot; he paused 
                unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: 
                &quot;but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas 
                Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You need not have said that to me, Father,&quot; said 
                the son with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man was silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I also wanted to ask you,&quot; continued Prince Andrew, 
                &quot;if I'm killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken 
                away from you- as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... 
                Please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not let the wife have him?&quot; said the old man, and 
                laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　They stood silent, facing one another. The old man's sharp 
                eyes were fixed straight on his son's. Something twitched in the 
                lower part of the old prince's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We've said good-by. Go!&quot; he suddenly shouted in 
                a loud, angry voice, opening his door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? What?&quot; asked both princesses when they 
                saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the 
                old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting 
                in an angry voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well!&quot; he said, turning to his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　And this &quot;Well!&quot; sounded coldly ironic, as if he 
                were saying,: &quot;Now go through your performance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, already!&quot; said the little princess, turning 
                pale and looking with dismay at her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his 
                shoulder.</p>
              <p> 　　He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked 
                into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Adieu, Mary,&quot; said he gently to his sister, taking 
                her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with 
                rapid steps.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                chafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, 
                still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door 
                through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the 
                cross in his direction. From the study, like pistol shots, came 
                the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly 
                had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and 
                the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked 
                out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gone? That's all right!&quot; said he; and looking angrily 
                at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly 
                and slammed the door. </p>

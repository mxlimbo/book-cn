              <p> 　　Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, 
                and not waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off 
                for home.</p>
              <p> 　　It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey 
                he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made 
                so strange and memorable an impression on him. In the forest the 
                harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six 
                weeks before, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the 
                young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general 
                beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately 
                green with fluffy young shoots.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, 
                but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling 
                the road and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was 
                dark in the shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet 
                and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in 
                blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their voices reverberated 
                now near, now far away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew. &quot;But where is it?&quot; he again wondered, 
                gazing at the left side of the road, and without recognizing it 
                he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, 
                quite transfigured, spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green 
                foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the 
                evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts 
                and sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the hard 
                century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had sprouted 
                such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it is the same oak,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, 
                and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling 
                of joy and renewal. All the best moments of his life suddenly 
                rose to his memory. Austerlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife's 
                dead reproachful face, Pierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled 
                by the beauty of the night, and that night itself and the moon, 
                and.... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, life is not over at thirty-one!&quot; Prince Andrew 
                suddenly decided finally and decisively. &quot;It is not enough 
                for me to know what I have in me- everyone must know it: Pierre, 
                and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky, everyone 
                must know me, so that my life may not be lived for myself alone 
                while others live so apart from it, but so that it may be reflected 
                in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg 
                that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. 
                A whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing 
                it to be essential for him to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter 
                the service, kept springing up in his mind. He could not now understand 
                how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an 
                active share in life, just as a month before he had not understood 
                how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his 
                head. It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life 
                must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of 
                work and again played an active part in life. He did not even 
                remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical 
                arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself 
                if he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself 
                to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility 
                of happiness or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. 
                After that journey to Ryazan he found the country dull; his former 
                pursuits no longer interested him, and often when sitting alone 
                in his study he got up, went to the mirror, and gazed a long time 
                at his own face. Then he would turn away to the portrait of his 
                dead Lise, who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and 
                gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She did not now say those 
                former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily, and 
                inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his arms behind 
                him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as he reflected 
                on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a crime, 
                which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with 
                fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman's beauty 
                and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he 
                was particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear,&quot; Princess Mary entering at such a moment 
                would say, &quot;little Nicholas can't go out today, it's very 
                cold.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If it were hot,&quot; Prince Andrew would reply at such 
                times very dryly to his sister, &quot;he could go out in his smock, 
                but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes, which were designed 
                for that purpose. That is what follows from the fact that it is 
                cold; and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at 
                home,&quot; he would add with extreme logic, as if punishing someone 
                for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him.</p>
              <p> 　　At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual 
                work dries men up. </p>

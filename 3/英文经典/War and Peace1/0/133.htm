              <p> 　　The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor- idleness- 
                was a condition of the first man's blessedness before the Fall. 
                Fallen man has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs 
                on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the 
                sweat of our brows, but because our moral nature is such that 
                we cannot be both idle and at ease. An inner voice tells us we 
                are in the wrong if we are idle. If man could find a state in 
                which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty, he 
                would have found one of the conditions of man's primitive blessedness. 
                And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is 
                the lot of a whole class- the military. The chief attraction of 
                military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory 
                and irreproachable idleness.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the 
                full when, after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd 
                regiment, in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken 
                over from Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow 
                acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was 
                liked and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, 
                and was well contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found 
                in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother 
                that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder, 
                and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort 
                his old parents.</p>
              <p> 　　Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting 
                to take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all 
                the entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. 
                He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool 
                of life, with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened 
                out, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its 
                ties, society, and with Sonya's love and his promise to her. It 
                was all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he replied to 
                his mother in cold, formal letters in French, beginning: &quot;My 
                dear Mamma,&quot; and ending: &quot;Your obedient son,&quot; which 
                said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received letters 
                from his parents, in which they told him of Natasha's engagement 
                to Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in a year's time because 
                the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and mortified 
                Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Natasha, for whom 
                he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost 
                to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted 
                not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkonski that connection 
                with him was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved 
                Natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father. 
                For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave 
                in order to see Natasha before she was married, but then came 
                the maneuvers, and considerations about Sonya and about the confusion 
                of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off. But in the spring 
                of that year, he received a letter from his mother, written without 
                his father's knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return. 
                She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand, their 
                whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have 
                to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted Mitenka so much, 
                and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him 
                and things were going from bad to worse. &quot;For God's sake, 
                I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and 
                the whole family wretched,&quot; wrote the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of 
                a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.</p>
              <p> 　　The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, 
                at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; 
                but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, 
                an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for 
                a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, 
                he informed Lavrushka (Denisov's servant who had remained with 
                him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was 
                applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as 
                it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having 
                heard from the staff- and this interested him extremely- whether 
                he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St. 
                Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he 
                would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish 
                Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had 
                betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible 
                as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of 
                the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans 
                who had given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) 
                would take place without him- he knew he must go away from this 
                good, bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and 
                confused. A week later he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades- 
                not only those of his own regiment, but the whole brigade- gave 
                Rostov a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a 
                head, and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers. 
                Rostov danced the Trepak with Major Basov; the tipsy officers 
                tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostov; the soldiers of the third 
                squadron tossed him too, and shouted &quot;hurrah!&quot; and then 
                they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first 
                post station.</p>
              <p> 　　During the first half of the journey- from Kremenchug to Kiev- 
                all Rostov's thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind 
                him, with the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway 
                he began to forget his three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, 
                and to wonder anxiously how things would be at Otradnoe and what 
                he would find there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer 
                he approached it- far stronger, as though this feeling of his 
                was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in 
                inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At the last 
                post station before Otradnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble 
                tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps 
                of his home.</p>
              <p> 　　After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of 
                unsatisfied expectation- the feeling that &quot;everything is 
                just the same, so why did I hurry?&quot;- Nicholas began to settle 
                down in his old home world. His father and mother were much the 
                same, only a little older. What was new in them was a certain 
                uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to be, 
                and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state 
                of their affairs. Sonya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing 
                prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but that 
                was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas 
                returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had 
                a gladdening effect on him. Petya and Natasha surprised Nicholas 
                most. Petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, 
                and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for 
                Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever 
                he looked at her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're not the same at all,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How? Am I uglier?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!&quot; 
                he whispered to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, yes!&quot; cried Natasha, joyfully.</p>
              <p> 　　She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his 
                visit to Otradnoe and showed him his last letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, are you glad?&quot; Natasha asked. &quot;I am 
                so tranquil and happy now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very glad,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;He is an excellent 
                fellow.... And are you very much in love?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How shall I put it?&quot; replied Natasha. &quot;I was 
                in love with Boris, with my teacher, and with Denisov, but this 
                is quite different. I feel at peace and settled. I know that no 
                better man than he exists, and I am calm and contented now. Not 
                at all as before.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of 
                the marriage for a year; but Natasha attacked her brother with 
                exasperation, proving to him that it could not be otherwise, and 
                that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father's 
                will, and that she herself wished it so.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You don't at all understand,&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.</p>
              <p> 　　Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not 
                seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced 
                husband. She was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful 
                as of old. This amazed Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski's 
                courtship skeptically. He could not believe that her fate was 
                sealed, especially as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. 
                It always seemed to him that there was something not quite right 
                about this intended marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why this delay? Why no betrothal?&quot; he thought. 
                Once, when he had touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, 
                to his surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the 
                depth of her soul she too had doubts about this marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see he writes,&quot; said she, showing her son a 
                letter of Prince Andrew's, with that latent grudge a mother always 
                has in regard to a daughter's future married happiness, &quot;he 
                writes that he won't come before December. What can be keeping 
                him? Illness, probably! His health is very delicate. Don't tell 
                Natasha. And don't attach importance to her being so bright: that's 
                because she's living through the last days of her girlhood, but 
                I know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him! 
                However, God grant that everything turns out well!&quot; (She 
                always ended with these words.) &quot;He is an excellent man!&quot;</p>

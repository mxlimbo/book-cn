              <p> ¡¡¡¡From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with 
                Natasha's grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet 
                that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new 
                was appearing on his own horizon- from that day the problem of 
                the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly 
                tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question 
                &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Wherefore?&quot; which had come to him 
                amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question 
                or by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When he 
                listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when 
                he read or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified 
                as formerly, and did not ask himself why men struggled so about 
                these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible- but 
                he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts 
                vanished- not because she had answered the questions that had 
                haunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him 
                instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity 
                in which no one could be justified or guilty- a realm of beauty 
                and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness 
                presented itself to him, he said to himself:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, 
                and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does 
                that matter? She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, 
                and I love her, and no one will ever know it.&quot; And his soul 
                felt calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the 
                same idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent 
                at the Rostovs' there were other hours he had to spend somehow, 
                and the habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed 
                a current that bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when 
                more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and 
                Natasha's health began to improve and she no longer aroused in 
                him the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, 
                which he could not explain, took possession of him. He felt that 
                the condition he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe 
                was coming which would change his whole life, and he impatiently 
                sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One 
                of his brother Masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy 
                concerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation of St. John.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said: </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the 
                number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
                is Six hundred threescore and six. And in the fifth verse of the 
                same chapter: </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things 
                and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty 
                and two months. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values 
                as the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and 
                the others tens, will have the following significance: </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡a¡¡¡¡ b¡¡¡¡ c¡¡¡¡ d¡¡¡¡ e¡¡¡¡ f¡¡¡¡ g¡¡¡¡ h¡¡¡¡ i¡¡¡¡ k</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡11¡¡¡¡ 2¡¡¡¡ 3¡¡¡¡ 4¡¡¡¡ 5¡¡¡¡ 6¡¡¡¡ 7¡¡¡¡ 8¡¡¡¡ 9¡¡¡¡ 10</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡ l¡¡¡¡m¡¡¡¡n¡¡¡¡o¡¡¡¡p¡¡¡¡¡¡q¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡r¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡s</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡20¡¡¡¡ 30¡¡¡¡ 40¡¡¡¡ 50¡¡¡¡ 60¡¡¡¡ 70¡¡¡¡ 80¡¡¡¡ 90</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡t¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡u¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡v¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡w¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡x¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡y</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ 100¡¡¡¡110¡¡¡¡120¡¡¡¡130¡¡¡¡140¡¡¡¡150</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡Z¡z</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡160 </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Writing the words L'Empereur Napoleon in numbers, it appears 
                that the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon therefore the beast 
                foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system 
                to the words quarante-deux,* which was the term allowed to the 
                beast that &quot;spoke great things and blasphemies,&quot; the 
                same number 666 was obtained; from which it followed that the 
                limit fixed for Napoleon's power had come in the year 1812 when 
                the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre 
                very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to 
                the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the 
                same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to 
                find an answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the 
                words L'Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their 
                numbers, but the sums were either more or less than 666. Once 
                when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in French, 
                Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come 
                right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the 
                s and adding de and the article le, still without obtaining the 
                desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the answer to the 
                question were contained in his name, his nationality would also 
                be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding 
                up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five 
                was represented by e, the very letter elided from the article 
                le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, 
                Pierre got the answer he sought. L'russe Besuhof made 666. This 
                discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected 
                with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, 
                but he did not doubt that connection for a moment. His love for 
                Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666, L'Empereur 
                Napoleon, and L'russe Besuhof- all this had to mature and culminate, 
                to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow habits 
                in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great 
                achievement and great happiness. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡*Forty-two. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, 
                Pierre had promised the Rostovs to bring them, from Count Rostopchin 
                whom he knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news 
                from the army. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopchin's 
                he met there a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of 
                his own, who often danced at Moscow balls.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Do, please, for heaven's sake, relieve me of something!&quot; 
                said the courier. &quot;I have a sackful of letters to parents.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father. 
                Pierre took that letter, and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor's 
                appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, 
                and his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, 
                Pierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, 
                and rewarded, the name of Nicholas Rostov, awarded a St. George's 
                Cross of the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostrovna affair, 
                and in the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkonski, appointed 
                to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though he did not want 
                to remind the Rostovs of Bolkonski, Pierre could not refrain from 
                making them happy by the news of their son's having received a 
                decoration, so he sent that printed army order and Nicholas' letter 
                to the Rostovs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other 
                orders to take with him when he went to dinner.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡His conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter's tone 
                of anxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually 
                of how badly things were going in the army, the rumors of the 
                discovery of spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating 
                that Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the 
                autumn, and the talk of the Emperor's being expected to arrive 
                next day- all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation 
                and expectation in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever 
                since the appearance of the comet, and especially since the beginning 
                of the war.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have 
                done so had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of 
                the Society of Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which 
                preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, 
                by the fact that when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who 
                had donned uniform and were talking patriotism, he somehow felt 
                ashamed to take the step. But the chief reason for not carrying 
                out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that 
                he was L'russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast, 666; that 
                his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of 
                the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined 
                from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything, 
                but wait for what was bound to come to pass. </p>

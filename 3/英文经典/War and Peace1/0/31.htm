              <p> 　　On returning from the review, Kutuzov took the Austrian general 
                into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some 
                papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, 
                and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who 
                was in command of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkonski came 
                into the room with the required papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian 
                member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which 
                a plan was spread out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!...&quot; said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if 
                by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he 
                went on with the conversation in French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All I can say, General,&quot; said he with a pleasant 
                elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen 
                to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutuzov 
                himself listened with pleasure to his own voice. &quot;All I can 
                say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, 
                the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled 
                long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe 
                me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to 
                hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a 
                better informed and more skillful general- of whom Austria has 
                so many- and to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances 
                are sometimes too strong for us, General.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, &quot;You 
                are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don't even care whether 
                you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And 
                that is the whole point.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option 
                but to reply in the same tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary,&quot; he said, in a querulous and angry 
                tone that contrasted with his flattering words, &quot;on the contrary, 
                your excellency's participation in the common action is highly 
                valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving 
                the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels 
                they have been accustomed to win in their battles,&quot; he concluded 
                his evidently prearranged sentence.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov bowed with the same smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter 
                with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, 
                I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so 
                skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained 
                a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,&quot; said Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of 
                an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the 
                unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutuzov's suggestion 
                of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov went 
                on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say 
                that he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter 
                he had received from Mack's army informed him of a victory and 
                stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give me that letter,&quot; said Kutuzov turning to Prince 
                Andrew. &quot;Please have a look at it&quot;- and Kutuzov with 
                an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian 
                general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand's 
                letter: </p>
              <p> 　　We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand 
                men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross 
                the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived 
                of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that 
                should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, 
                throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river 
                lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct 
                his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore 
                confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will 
                be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily 
                find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves. </p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked 
                at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising 
                one to expect the worst,&quot; said the Austrian general, evidently 
                wishing to have done with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily 
                looked round at the aide-de-camp.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, General,&quot; interrupted Kutuzov, also 
                turning to Prince Andrew. &quot;Look here, my dear fellow, get 
                from Kozlovski all the reports from our scouts. Here are two letters 
                from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke 
                Ferdinand and here are these,&quot; he said, handing him several 
                papers, &quot;make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, 
                showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian 
                army, and then give it to his excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood 
                from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov 
                would have liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with 
                a bow to both, stepped softly over the carpet and went out into 
                the waiting room.</p>
              <p> 　　Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left 
                Russia, he had changed greatly during that period. In the expression 
                of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was 
                left of his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked 
                like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on 
                others, but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work. His 
                face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around 
                him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him 
                very kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above 
                the other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him 
                the more serious commissions. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his 
                old comrade, Prince Andrew's father. </p>
              <p> 　　Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his 
                industry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate 
                to have such a subordinate by me. </p>
              <p> 　　On Kutuzov's staff, among his fellow officers and in the army 
                generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, 
                two quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged 
                him to be different from themselves and from everyone else, expected 
                great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, 
                and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, 
                the majority, disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, 
                and disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew knew how 
                to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming out of Kutuzov's room into the waiting room with the 
                papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp 
                on duty, Kozlovski, who was sitting at the window with a book.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Prince?&quot; asked Kozlovski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we 
                are not advancing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Any news from Mack?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If it were true that he has been beaten, news would 
                have come.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Probably,&quot; said Prince Andrew moving toward the 
                outer door.</p>
              <p> 　　But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, 
                with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage 
                round his head, who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, 
                slamming the door. Prince Andrew stopped short.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Commander in Chief Kutuzov?&quot; said the newly arrived 
                general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to 
                both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The commander in chief is engaged,&quot; said Kozlovski, 
                going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way 
                to the door. &quot;Whom shall I announce?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski, 
                who was rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The commander in chief is engaged,&quot; repeated Kozlovski 
                calmly.</p>
              <p> 　　The general's face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. 
                He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, 
                tore out the leaf, gave it to Kozlovski, stepped quickly to the 
                window, and threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the 
                room as if asking, &quot;Why do they look at me?&quot; Then he 
                lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, 
                but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, 
                producing a queer sound which immediately broke off. The door 
                of the private room opened and Kutuzov appeared in the doorway. 
                The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running 
                away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his 
                thin legs, went up to Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,&quot; he uttered in a 
                broken voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly 
                immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like 
                a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head 
                respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room 
                before him, and closed the door himself behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had 
                been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved 
                to be correct. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in 
                various directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, 
                who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the 
                enemy.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief 
                interest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack 
                and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half 
                the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the 
                Russian army's position, and vividly imagined what awaited it 
                and the part he would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful 
                agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria 
                and that in a week's time he might, perhaps, see and take part 
                in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suvorov met 
                them. He feared that Bonaparte's genius might outweigh all the 
                courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time could not 
                admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.</p>
              <p> 　　Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went 
                toward his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every 
                day. In the corridor he met Nesvitski, with whom he shared a room, 
                and the wag Zherkov; they were as usual laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you so glum?&quot; asked Nesvitski noticing 
                Prince Andrew's pale face and glittering eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's nothing to be gay about,&quot; answered Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov, there came 
                toward them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian 
                general who on Kutuzov's staff in charge of the provisioning of 
                the Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had 
                arrived the previous evening. There was room enough in the wide 
                corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, 
                but Zherkov, pushing Nesvitski aside with his arm, said in a breathless 
                voice,</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They're coming!... they're coming!... Stand aside, make 
                way, please make way!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to 
                avoid embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkov 
                there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed 
                unable to suppress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency,&quot; said he in German, stepping forward 
                and addressing the Austrian general, &quot;I have the honor to 
                congratulate you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then 
                with the other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.</p>
              <p> 　　The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, 
                seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give 
                him a moment's attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that 
                he was listening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has 
                arrived, quite well, only a little bruised just here,&quot; he 
                added, pointing with a beaming smile to his head.</p>
              <p> 　　The general frowned, turned away, and went on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gott, wie naiv!&quot;* said he angrily, after he had 
                gone a few steps. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Good God, what simplicity!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, 
                but Bolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry 
                look and turned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation aroused by 
                the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought 
                of what lay before the Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkov's 
                untimely jest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,&quot; 
                he said sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, &quot;I 
                can't prevent your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to 
                play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nesvitski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that 
                they gazed at Bolkonski silently with wide-open eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's the matter? I only congratulated them,&quot; 
                said Zherkov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not jesting with you; please be silent!&quot; cried 
                Bolkonski, and taking Nesvitski's arm he left Zherkov, who did 
                not know what to say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, what's the matter, old fellow?&quot; said Nesvitski 
                trying to soothe him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's the matter?&quot; exclaimed Prince Andrew standing 
                still in his excitement. &quot;Don't you understand that either 
                we are officers serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in 
                the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, 
                or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master's business. 
                Quarante mille hommes massacres et l'armee de nos allies detruite, 
                et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire,&quot;* he said, as if strengthening 
                his views by this French sentence. &quot;C' est bien pour un garcon 
                de rein comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas 
                pour vous, pas pour vous.*[2] Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself 
                in this way,&quot; he added in Russian- but pronouncing the word 
                with a French accent- having noticed that Zherkov could still 
                hear him. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies 
                destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow 
                of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for you.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, 
                but he turned and went out of the corridor. </p>

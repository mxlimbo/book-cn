              <p> 　　The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting 
                the young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who 
                was four years older than her sister and behaved already like 
                a grown-up person), were Nicholas and Sonya, the niece. Sonya 
                was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which 
                were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round 
                her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in 
                the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. 
                By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility 
                of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, 
                she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises 
                to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it 
                proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, 
                but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes 
                watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate 
                girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant 
                impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled 
                down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her 
                cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha and Boris, escape 
                from the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah yes, my dear,&quot; said the count, addressing the 
                visitor and pointing to Nicholas, &quot;his friend Boris has become 
                an officer, and so for friendship's sake he is leaving the university 
                and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my 
                dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in 
                the Archives Department! Isn't that friendship?&quot; remarked 
                the count in an inquiring tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But they say that war has been declared,&quot; replied 
                the visitor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They've been saying so a long while,&quot; said the 
                count, &quot;and they'll say so again and again, and that will 
                be the end of it. My dear, there's friendship for you,&quot; he 
                repeated. &quot;He's joining the hussars.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not at all from friendship,&quot; declared Nicholas, 
                flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. &quot;It 
                is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is 
                my vocation.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they 
                were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Schubert, the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars, is dining 
                with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas 
                back with him. It can't be helped!&quot; said the count, shrugging 
                his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently 
                distressed him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have already told you, Papa,&quot; said his son, &quot;that 
                if you don't wish to let me go, I'll stay. But I know I am no 
                use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government 
                clerk.- I don't know how to hide what I feel.&quot; As he spoke 
                he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth 
                at Sonya and the young lady visitor.</p>
              <p> 　　The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready 
                at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish 
                nature.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right!&quot; said the old count. &quot;He 
                always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; 
                they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. 
                Well, well, God grant it,&quot; he added, not noticing his visitor's 
                sarcastic smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned 
                to young Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' on Thursday. 
                It was so dull without you,&quot; said she, giving him a tender 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish 
                smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation 
                without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed 
                the heart of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the 
                midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately 
                angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain 
                the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. 
                All Nicholas' animation vanished. He waited for the first pause 
                in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the 
                room to find Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How plainly all these young people wear their hearts 
                on their sleeves!&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas 
                as he went out. &quot;Cousinage- dangereux voisinage;&quot;* she 
                added. </p>
              <p> 　　*Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said the countess when the brightness these 
                young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if 
                answering a question no one had put but which was always in her 
                mind, &quot;and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had 
                to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really 
                the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always 
                anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls 
                and boys.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It all depends on the bringing up,&quot; remarked the 
                visitor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you're quite right,&quot; continued the countess. 
                &quot;Till now I have always, thank God, been my children's friend 
                and had their full confidence,&quot; said she, repeating the mistake 
                of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets 
                from them. &quot;I know I shall always be my daughters' first 
                confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does 
                get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he will all the same 
                never be like those Petersburg young men.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,&quot; chimed 
                in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing 
                by deciding that everything was splendid. &quot;Just fancy: wants 
                to be an hussar. What's one to do, my dear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a charming creature your younger girl is,&quot; 
                said the visitor; &quot;a little volcano!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, a regular volcano,&quot; said the count. &quot;Takes 
                after me! And what a voice she has; though she's my daughter, 
                I tell the truth when I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! 
                We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Isn't she too young? I have heard that it harms the 
                voice to train it at that age.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh no, not at all too young!&quot; replied the count. 
                &quot;Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And she's in love with Boris already. Just fancy!&quot; 
                said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Boris' and went 
                on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: 
                &quot;Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid 
                it... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly&quot; 
                (she meant that they would be kissing), &quot;but as it is, I 
                know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her 
                own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil 
                her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister 
                I was stricter.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I was brought up quite differently,&quot; remarked 
                the handsome elder daughter, Countess Vera, with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles generally 
                do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, 
                expression. Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at 
                learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what 
                she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone- 
                the visitors and countess alike- turned to look at her as if wondering 
                why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;People are always too clever with their eldest children 
                and try to make something exceptional of them,&quot; said the 
                visitor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess 
                was too clever with Vera,&quot; said the count. &quot;Well, what 
                of that? She's turned out splendidly all the same,&quot; he added, 
                winking at Vera.</p>
              <p> 　　The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return 
                to dinner.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What manners! I thought they would never go,&quot; said 
                the countess, when she had seen her guests out. </p>

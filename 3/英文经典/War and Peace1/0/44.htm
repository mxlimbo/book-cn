              <p> 　　Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, 
                Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff 
                officer had told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, 
                and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. 
                Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he 
                stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed 
                his measured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers 
                and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen's bonfires. 
                To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly 
                constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers' 
                voices in eager conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position 
                and the greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery. 
                Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village 
                of Schon Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and 
                right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the 
                greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and 
                behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid the smoke, 
                was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see 
                it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a 
                rather steep incline which dominated the French position. Our 
                infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons. 
                In the center, where Tushin's battery stood and from which Prince 
                Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct 
                descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern. 
                On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked 
                the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French 
                line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily 
                outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and 
                deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. 
                Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, 
                sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes on two points, 
                intending to mention them to Bagration. His idea was, first, to 
                concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to 
                withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, 
                being always near the commander in chief, closely following the 
                mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying historical 
                accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the course 
                of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined 
                only important possibilities: &quot;If the enemy attacks the right 
                flank,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;the Kiev grenadiers and 
                the Podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from 
                the center come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully 
                make a flank counterattack. If they attack our center we, having 
                the center battery on this high ground, shall withdraw the left 
                flank under its cover, and retreat to the dip by echelons.&quot; 
                So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the gun, he 
                had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often 
                happens had not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, 
                however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its 
                tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, friend,&quot; said a pleasant and, as it seemed 
                to Prince Andrew, a familiar voice, &quot;what I say is that if 
                it were possible to know what is beyond death, none of us would 
                be afraid of it. That's so, friend.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: &quot;Afraid or 
                not, you can't escape it anyhow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,&quot; 
                said a third manly voice interrupting them both. &quot;Of course 
                you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everything 
                along with you- vodka and snacks.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer, 
                laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, one is afraid,&quot; continued the first speaker, 
                he of the familiar voice. &quot;One is afraid of the unknown, 
                that's what it is. Whatever we may say about the soul going to 
                the sky... we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin,&quot; 
                it said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, &quot;that's the captain 
                who stood up in the sutler's hut without his boots.&quot; He recognized 
                the agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Some herb vodka? Certainly!&quot; said Tushin. &quot;But 
                still, to conceive a future life...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; 
                nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon 
                ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded 
                into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing 
                up a mass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible 
                impact.</p>
              <p> 　　And immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of 
                his mouth and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out 
                of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing 
                infantry officer who hurried off to his company, buttoning up 
                his coat as he ran. </p>

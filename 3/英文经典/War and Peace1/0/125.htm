              <p> 　　Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited 
                before, and among them at the Rostovs' with whom he had renewed 
                acquaintance at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness 
                which demanded the call, he wanted to see that original, eager 
                girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her 
                own home.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing 
                a dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even 
                prettier than in her ball dress. She and all the Rostov family 
                welcomed him as an old friend, simply and cordially. The whole 
                family, whom he had formerly judged severely, now seemed to him 
                to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count's 
                hospitality and good nature, which struck one especially in Petersburg 
                as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew could not 
                refuse to stay to dinner. &quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;they 
                are capital people, who of course have not the slightest idea 
                what a treasure they possess in Natasha; but they are kindly folk 
                and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic, 
                charming girl, overflowing with life!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world 
                completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a 
                different world, that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window 
                that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him. Now 
                this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien 
                to him, but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment.</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew's request, went to 
                the clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window 
                talking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase 
                he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing 
                he had thought impossible for him. He looked at Natasha as she 
                sang, and something new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt 
                happy and at the same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep 
                about yet he was ready to weep. What about? His former love? The 
                little princess? His disillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... 
                Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the 
                terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable 
                within him and that limited and material something that he, and 
                even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while 
                she sang.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him and asked 
                how he liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, 
                feeling that she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking 
                at her, and said he liked her singing as he liked everything she 
                did.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew left the Rostovs' late in the evening. He went 
                to bed from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. 
                Having lit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay 
                down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul 
                was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room 
                into God's own fresh air. It did not enter his head that he was 
                in love with Natasha; he was not thinking about her, but only 
                picturing her to himself, and in consequence all life appeared 
                in a new light. &quot;Why do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow, 
                confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open 
                to me?&quot; said he to himself. And for the first time for a 
                very long while he began making happy plans for the future. He 
                decided that he must attend to his son's education by finding 
                a tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire 
                from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and 
                <br>
                Italy. &quot;I must use my freedom while I feel so much strength 
                and youth in me,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Pierre was right 
                when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness 
                in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead 
                bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!&quot; 
                thought he.</p>

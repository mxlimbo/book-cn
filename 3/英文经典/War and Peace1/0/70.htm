              <p> 　　On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostov was 
                welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their 
                darling Nikolenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, 
                and polite young man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant 
                of hussars, a good dancer, and one of the best matches in the 
                city.</p>
              <p> 　　The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money 
                enough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and 
                so Nicholas, acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding 
                breeches of the latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, 
                and boots of the latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and 
                small silver spurs, passed his time very gaily. After a short 
                period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life, Nicholas 
                found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he had 
                grown up and matured very much. His despair at failing in a Scripture 
                examination, his borrowing money from Gavril to pay a sleigh driver, 
                his kissing Sonya on the sly- he now recalled all this as childishness 
                he had left immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, 
                in a jacket laced with silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, 
                awarded to soldiers for bravery in action, and in the company 
                of well-known, elderly, and respected racing men was training 
                a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one of the 
                boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at 
                the Arkharovs' ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski, 
                visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a colonel 
                of forty to whom Denisov had introduced</p>
              <p> 　　His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. 
                But still, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing 
                him, he often spoke about him and about his love for him, letting 
                it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something 
                in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand, 
                and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in 
                Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of as the &quot;angel incarnate.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　During Rostov's short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the 
                army, he did not draw closer to Sonya, but rather drifted away 
                from her. She was very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply 
                in love with him, but he was at the period of youth when there 
                seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing 
                and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his freedom which 
                he needs for so many other things. When he thought of Sonya, during 
                this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, &quot;Ah, there will 
                be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not 
                yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I 
                want to, but now I have no time.&quot; Besides, it seemed to him 
                that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. 
                He went to balls and into ladies' society with an affectation 
                of doing so against his will. The races, the English Club, sprees 
                with Denisov, and visits to a certain house- that was another 
                matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!</p>
              <p> 　　At the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was very 
                busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English 
                Club.</p>
              <p> 　　The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, 
                giving orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist, 
                the Club's head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, 
                veal, and fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and 
                on the committee of the Club from the day it was founded. To him 
                the Club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of 
                Bagration, for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on 
                an open-handed, hospitable scale, and still fewer men would be 
                so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources 
                what might be needed for the success of the fete. The club cook 
                and the steward listened to the count's orders with pleased faces, 
                for they knew that under no other management could they so easily 
                extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing several 
                thousand rubles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, mind and have cocks' comb in the turtle soup, 
                you know!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall we have three cold dishes then?&quot; asked the 
                cook.</p>
              <p> 　　The count considered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We can't have less- yes, three... the mayonnaise, that's 
                one,&quot; said he, bending down a finger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then am I to order those large sterlets?&quot; asked 
                the steward.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take less. Ah, 
                dear me! I was forgetting. We must have another entree. Ah, goodness 
                gracious!&quot; he clutched at his head. &quot;Who is going to 
                get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh, Dmitri! Gallop off to our Moscow 
                estate,&quot; he said to the factotum who appeared at his call. 
                &quot;Hurry off and tell Maksim, the gardener, to set the serfs 
                to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must be brought 
                here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots here 
                on Friday.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his 
                &quot;little countess&quot; to have a rest, but remembering something 
                else of importance, he returned again, called back the cook and 
                the club steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep 
                and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young 
                count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently 
                rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my boy, my head's in a whirl!&quot; said the old 
                man with a smile, as if he felt a little confused before his son. 
                &quot;Now, if you would only help a bit! I must have singers too. 
                I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldn't we get the gypsy 
                singers as well? You military men like that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagration worried himself 
                less before the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now,&quot; 
                said his son with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The old count pretended to be angry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful 
                expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father 
                and son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktist?&quot; 
                said he. &quot;Laughing at us old fellows!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's so, your excellency, all they have to do is to 
                eat a good dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that's 
                not their business!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's it, that's it!&quot; exclaimed the count, and 
                gaily seizing his son by both hands, he cried, &quot;Now I've 
                got you, so take the sleigh and pair at once, and go to Bezukhob's, 
                and tell him 'Count Ilya has sent you to ask for strawberries 
                and fresh pineapples.' We can't get them from anyone else. He's 
                not there himself, so you'll have to go in and ask the princesses; 
                and from there go on to the Rasgulyay- the coachman Ipatka knows- 
                and look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who danced at Count Orlov's, 
                you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to 
                me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?&quot; 
                asked Nicholas, laughing. &quot;Dear, dear!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike, 
                preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, 
                Anna Mikhaylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count 
                in his dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused 
                and begged her to excuse his costume.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No matter at all, my dear count,&quot; she said, meekly 
                closing her eyes. &quot;But I'll go to Bezukhov's myself. Pierre 
                has arrived, and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. 
                I have to see him in any case. He has forwarded me a letter from 
                Boris. Thank God, Boris is now on the staff.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna's taking upon 
                herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage 
                for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell Bezukhov to come. I'll put his name down. Is his 
                wife with him?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness 
                was depicted on her face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,&quot; she 
                said. &quot;If what we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little 
                we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness! 
                And such a lofty angelic soul as young Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him 
                from my heart, and shall try to give him what consolation I can.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wh-what is the matter?&quot; asked both the young and 
                old Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dolokhov, Mary Ivanovna's son,&quot; she said in a mysterious 
                whisper, &quot;has compromised her completely, they say. Pierre 
                took him up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... 
                she has come here and that daredevil after her!&quot; said Anna 
                Mikhaylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary 
                intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the &quot;daredevil,&quot; 
                as she called Dolokhov. &quot;They say Pierre is quite broken 
                by his misfortune.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Club- 
                it will all blow over. It will be a tremendous banquet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Next day, the third of March, soon after one o'clock, two 
                hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests 
                were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, 
                Prince Bagration, to dinner.</p>
              <p> 　　On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, 
                Moscow had been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so 
                used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would 
                simply not believe it, while others sought some extraordinary 
                explanation of so strange an event. In the English Club, where 
                all who were distinguished, important, and well informed forgathered 
                when the news began to arrive in December, nothing was said about 
                the war and the last battle, as though all were in a conspiracy 
                of silence. The men who set the tone in conversation- Count Rostopchin, 
                Prince Yuri Dolgorukov, Valuev, Count Markov, and Prince Vyazemski- 
                did not show themselves at the Club, but met in private houses 
                in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions 
                from others- Ilya Rostov among them- remained for a while without 
                any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders. 
                The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss 
                the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent. But 
                after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs 
                who guided the Club's opinion reappeared, and everybody began 
                speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the incredible, 
                unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything 
                became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began 
                to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, 
                a defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski 
                and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kutuzov's incapacity, and (it was 
                whispered) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had 
                trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the army, the 
                Russian army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had achieved 
                miracles of valor.The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. 
                But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration, distinguished by 
                his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz, where 
                he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten 
                back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced 
                to Bagration's being selected as Moscow's hero was the fact that 
                he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In 
                his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier 
                without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated 
                by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov. 
                Moreover, paying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing 
                disapproval and dislike of Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary 
                to invent him,&quot; said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words 
                of Voltaire. Kutuzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him 
                in whispers, calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.</p>
              <p> 　　All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov's saying: &quot;If you 
                go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,&quot; 
                suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former 
                victories; and the words of Rostopchin, that French soldiers have 
                to be incited to battle by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical 
                arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than 
                to advance, but that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained 
                and held back! On all sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard 
                of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men 
                at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had killed five 
                Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg was 
                mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded 
                in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone forward. 
                Of Bolkonski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him intimately 
                regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife with 
                his eccentric father. </p>

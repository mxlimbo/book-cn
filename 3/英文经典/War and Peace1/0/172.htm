              <p> 　　Davout was to Napoleon what Arakcheev was to Alexander- though 
                not a coward like Arakcheev, he was as precise, as cruel, and 
                as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.</p>
              <p> 　　In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves 
                are necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, 
                always appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence 
                and their proximity to the head of the government may be. This 
                inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakcheev, who tore 
                out a grenadier's mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves 
                rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated 
                man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful position 
                with Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and 
                gentle.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a 
                peasant's hut, writing- he was auditing accounts. Better quarters 
                could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those 
                men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions 
                to have a justification for being gloomy. For the same reason 
                they are always hard at work and in a hurry. &quot;How can I think 
                of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a 
                barrel and working in a dirty shed?&quot; the expression of his 
                face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men, 
                when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their 
                own dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure 
                when Balashev was brought in. He became still more absorbed in 
                his task when the Russian general entered, and after glancing 
                over his spectacles at Balashev's face, which was animated by 
                the beauty of the morning and by his talk with Murat, he did not 
                rise or even stir, but scowled still more and sneered malevolently.</p>
              <p> 　　When he noticed in Balashev's face the disagreeable impression 
                this reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked 
                what he wanted.</p>
              <p> 　　Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only 
                because Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the 
                Emperor Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened 
                to inform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, 
                Davout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is your dispatch?&quot; he inquired. &quot;Give 
                it to me. I will send it to the Emperor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally 
                to the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your Emperor's orders are obeyed in your army, but here,&quot; 
                said Davout, &quot;you must do as you're told.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious 
                of his dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call 
                the officer on duty.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter 
                and laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still 
                hanging on it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet 
                and read the inscription.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect 
                or not,&quot; protested Balashev, &quot;but permit me to observe 
                that I have the honor to be adjutant general to His Majesty....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure 
                from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev's 
                face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will be treated as is fitting,&quot; said he and, 
                putting the packet in his pocket, left the shed.</p>
              <p> 　　A minute later the marshal's adjutant, de Castres, came in 
                and conducted Balashev to the quarters assigned him.</p>
              <p> 　　That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the 
                barrels.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev 
                to come to him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to 
                move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move, 
                and to talk to no one except Monsieur de Castres.</p>
              <p> 　　After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his 
                impotence and insignificance- particularly acute by contrast with 
                the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved- and after 
                several marches with the marshal's baggage and the French army, 
                which occupied the whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna- 
                now occupied by the French- through the very gate by which he 
                had left it four days previously.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, 
                came to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's wish 
                to honor him with an audience.</p>
              <p> 　　Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment 
                had stood in front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, 
                and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened 
                in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of 
                hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, 
                and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were 
                standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, 
                Rustan. Napoleon received Balashev in the very house in Vilna 
                from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission. </p>

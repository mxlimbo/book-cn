              <p> 　　After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even 
                dull. He was worried by the impending necessity of interfering 
                in the stupid business matters for which his mother had called 
                him home. To throw off this burden as quickly as possible, on 
                the third day after his arrival he went, angry and scowling and 
                without answering questions as to where he was going, to Mitenka's 
                lodge and demanded an account of everything. But what an account 
                of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the frightened 
                and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation and the examination of 
                the accounts with Mitenka did not last long. The village elder, 
                a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in 
                the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count's 
                voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then 
                words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I'll hack the dog to 
                pieces! I'm not my father!... Robbing us!...&quot; and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young 
                count, red in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka 
                out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to 
                him behind with great agility at convenient moments between the 
                words, shouting, &quot;Be off! Never let me see your face here 
                again, you villain!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into 
                the shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge 
                for culprits at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from 
                the town, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe, 
                hiding from Mitenka, knew of its protective qualities.)</p>
              <p> 　　Mitenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened 
                faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling 
                and where the steward's high bedstead stood with its patchwork 
                quilt.</p>
              <p> 　　The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, 
                passed by with resolute strides and went into the house.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened 
                at the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs 
                would certainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as 
                to the effect this excitement might have on her son. She went 
                several times to his door on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted 
                one pipe after another.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed 
                smile, said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! 
                Mitenka has told me all about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I knew,&quot; thought Nicholas, &quot;that I should 
                never understand anything in this crazy world.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. 
                But they were carried forward- and you did not look at the other 
                page.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! 
                And what I have done, I have done; but, if you like, I won't speak 
                to him again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, my dear boy&quot; (the count, too, felt embarrassed. 
                He knew he had mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame 
                toward his children, but he did not know how to remedy it). &quot;No, 
                I beg you to attend to the business. I am old. I...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. 
                I understand it all less than you do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and 
                carryings forward from page to page,&quot; he thought. &quot;I 
                used to understand what a 'corner' and the stakes at cards meant, 
                but carrying forward to another page I don't understand at all,&quot; 
                said he to himself, and after that he did not meddle in business 
                affairs. But once the countess called her son and informed him 
                that she had a promissory note from Anna Mikhaylovna for two thousand 
                rubles, and asked him what he thought of doing with it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;You say it rests 
                with me. Well, I don't like Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like 
                Boris, but they were our friends and poor. Well then, this!&quot; 
                and he tore up the note, and by so doing caused the old countess 
                to weep tears of joy. After that, young Rostov took no further 
                part in any business affairs, but devoted himself with passionate 
                enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit- the chase- for which 
                his father kept a large establishment.</p>

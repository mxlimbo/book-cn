              <p> 　　It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep, when 
                the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little 
                town of Ostrovna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began 
                hurriedly getting ready and again boiled again boiled some muddy 
                water in the samovar. But Rostov went off to his squadron without 
                waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the 
                clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes 
                that were still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight 
                of the dawn, Rostov and Ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening 
                leather hood of the doctor's cart, from under the apron of which 
                his feet were sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife's 
                nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She really is a dear little thing,&quot; said Rostov 
                to Ilyin, who was following him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A charming woman!&quot; said Ilyin, with all the gravity 
                of a boy of sixteen.</p>
              <p> 　　Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. 
                The command was heard to &quot;mount&quot; and the soldiers crossed 
                themselves and mounted. Rostov riding in front gave the order 
                &quot;Forward!&quot; and the hussars, with clanking sabers and 
                subdued talk, their horses' hoofs splashing in the mud, defiled 
                in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees 
                on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone 
                on in front.</p>
              <p> 　　Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were 
                scudding before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. 
                That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became 
                clearly visible, still wet with the night's rain; the drooping 
                branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung 
                down bright drops of water to one side. The soldiers' faces were 
                more and more clearly visible. Rostov, always closely followed 
                by Ilyin, rode along the side of the road between two rows of 
                birch trees.</p>
              <p> 　　When campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of 
                riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses 
                and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, 
                mettlesome, Donets horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, 
                and when he rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse 
                was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, 
                of the doctor's wife, but not once of the impending danger.</p>
              <p> 　　Formerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt afraid; 
                now he had not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not 
                because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow 
                used to danger), but because he had learned how to manage his 
                thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed when going into 
                action to think about anything but what would seem most likely 
                to interest him- the impending danger. During the first period 
                of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself 
                with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time 
                it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under the birch 
                trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his 
                hand, sometimes touching his horse's side with his foot, or, without 
                turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding 
                behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he were 
                merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face 
                of Ilyin, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from 
                experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the 
                cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath 
                the clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty 
                of the summer morning after the storm; drops still continued to 
                fall, but vertically now, and all was still. The whole sun appeared 
                on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that 
                hung above it. A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still 
                from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything 
                grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply 
                to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.</p>
              <p> 　　Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance 
                of that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping 
                from Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.</p>
              <p> 　　The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery- 
                which had also quickened their pace- rode down a hill, and passing 
                through an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses 
                began to lather and the men to flush.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Halt! Dress your ranks!&quot; the order of the regimental 
                commander was heard ahead. &quot;Forward by the left. Walk, march!&quot; 
                came the order from in front.</p>
              <p> 　　And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left 
                flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the 
                front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: 
                they were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, 
                our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly 
                illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow 
                dale, could be seen the enemy's columns and guns. Our advanced 
                line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots 
                with the enemy in the dale.</p>
              <p> 　　At these sounds, long unheard, Rostov's spirits rose, as at 
                the strains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the 
                shots, now together, now several quickly one after another. Again 
                all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking 
                on detonators and exploding them.</p>
              <p> 　　The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. 
                A cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind 
                the squadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, 
                and rode up the hill to the guns.</p>
              <p> 　　After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Form column! Prepare to charge!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow 
                the cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their 
                spears fluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry 
                which was seen below to the left.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were 
                ordered up the hill to support the battery. As they took the places 
                vacated by the Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and 
                whistling, but fell spent without taking effect.</p>
              <p> 　　The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even 
                more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous 
                sounds of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle 
                opening out before him from the hill, and with his whole soul 
                followed the movement of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to 
                the French dragoons, something confused happened there amid the 
                smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, 
                not to the place they had occupied but more to the left, and among 
                the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them, 
                in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could be 
                seen. </p>

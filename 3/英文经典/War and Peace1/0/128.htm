              <p>CHAPTER XXII </p>
              <p> 　　Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew 
                dined with the Rostovs and spent the rest of the day there.</p>
              <p> 　　Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew 
                came, and without concealing it he tried to be with Natasha all 
                day. Not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured 
                Natasha, but in the whole house, there was a feeling of awe at 
                something important that was bound to happen. The countess looked 
                with sad and sternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked 
                to Natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation about 
                trifles as soon as he looked her way. Sonya was afraid to leave 
                Natasha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them. 
                Natasha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when she remained 
                alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by his 
                timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but 
                could not bring himself to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess 
                went up to Natasha and whispered: &quot;Well, what?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma! For heaven's sake don't ask me anything now! 
                One can't talk about that,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　But all the same that night Natasha, now agitated and now 
                frightened, lay long time in her mother's bed gazing straight 
                before her. She told her how he had complimented her, how he told 
                her he was going abroad, asked her where they were going to spend 
                the summer, and then how he had asked her about Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But such a... such a... never happened to me before!&quot; 
                she said. &quot;Only I feel afraid in his presence. I am always 
                afraid when I'm with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that 
                it's the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, my love; I am frightened myself,&quot; answered 
                her mother. &quot;Now go!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the same I shan't sleep. What silliness, to sleep! 
                Mummy! Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,&quot; 
                she said, surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of 
                in herself. &quot;And could we ever have thought!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to Natasha that even at the time she first saw Prince 
                Andrew at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as 
                if she feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again 
                the very man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she 
                had done so) and of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent 
                to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And it had to happen that he should come specially to 
                Petersburg while we are here. And it had to happen that we should 
                meet at that ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything 
                led up to this! Already then, directly I saw him I felt something 
                peculiar.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What else did he say to you? What are those verses? 
                Read them...&quot; said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to 
                some verses Prince Andrew had written in Natasha's album.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't, Natasha! Pray to God. 'Marriages are made in 
                heaven,'&quot; said her mother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!&quot; 
                cried Natasha, shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing 
                her mother.</p>
              <p> 　　At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and 
                telling him of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make 
                her his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　That day Countess Helene had a reception at her house. The 
                French ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood 
                who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant 
                ladies and gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked 
                through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, 
                and morose air.</p>
              <p> 　　Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous 
                depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since 
                the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly 
                been made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he 
                had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and 
                dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener 
                than before. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between 
                his protegee Natasha and Prince Andrew accentuated his gloom by 
                the contrast between his own position and his friend's. He tried 
                equally to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natasha and 
                Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him insignificant 
                in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what? presented 
                itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic 
                labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. 
                Toward midnight, after he had left the countess' apartments, he 
                was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the 
                original transaction of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a 
                table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke, when someone 
                came in. It was Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, it's you!&quot; said Pierre with a preoccupied, 
                dissatisfied air. &quot;And I, you see, am hard at it.&quot; He 
                pointed to his manuscript book with that air of escaping from 
                the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed 
                life on his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing 
                his sad look, smiled at him with the egotism of joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, dear heart,&quot; said he, &quot;I wanted to tell 
                you about it yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never 
                experienced anything like it before. I am in love, my friend!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person 
                down on the sofa beside Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With Natasha Rostova, yes?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have 
                believed it, but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented 
                myself and suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment 
                for anything in the world, I have not lived till now. At last 
                I live, but I can't live without her! But can she love me?... 
                I am too old for her.... Why don't you speak?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? I? What did I tell you?&quot; said Pierre suddenly, 
                rising and beginning to pace up and down the room. &quot;I always 
                thought it.... That girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... 
                My dear friend, I entreat you, don't philosophize, don't doubt, 
                marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier 
                man than you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what of her?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She loves you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't talk rubbish...&quot; said Prince Andrew, smiling 
                and looking into Pierre's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She does, I know,&quot; Pierre cried fiercely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But do listen,&quot; returned Prince Andrew, holding 
                him by the arm. &quot;Do you know the condition I am in? I must 
                talk about it to someone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,&quot; said Pierre, 
                and his face really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened 
                gladly to Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, 
                quite a different, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his 
                contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person 
                to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told 
                all that was in his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans 
                for an extended future, said he could not sacrifice his own happiness 
                to his father's caprice, and spoke of how he would either make 
                his father consent to this marriage and love her, or would do 
                without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that had 
                mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent 
                of himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should not have believed anyone who told me that I 
                was capable of such love,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;It is 
                not at all the same feeling that I knew in the past. The whole 
                world is now for me divided into two halves: one half is she, 
                and there all is joy, hope, light: the other half is everything 
                where she is not, and there is all gloom and darkness....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Darkness and gloom,&quot; reiterated Pierre: &quot;yes, 
                yes, I understand that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. 
                And I am very happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for 
                my sake.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Pierre assented, looking at his friend 
                with a touched and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince 
                Andrew's lot appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own. </p>

              <p> 　　At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops 
                of the center, the reserves, and Bagration's right flank had not 
                yet moved, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, 
                and artillery, which were to be the first to descend the heights 
                to attack the French right flank and drive it into the Bohemian 
                mountains according to plan, were already up and astir. The smoke 
                of the campfires, into which they were throwing everything superfluous, 
                made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly 
                drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit 
                and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering 
                round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, 
                chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they did not 
                want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides 
                were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as 
                heralds of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed 
                himself near a commanding officer's quarters, the regiment began 
                to move: the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into 
                their boots, their bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, 
                and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled 
                on their swords and pouches, and moved along the ranks shouting. 
                The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons 
                and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and regimental 
                commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, 
                orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, 
                and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The column 
                moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses 
                around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the 
                place they were leaving or that to which they were going.</p>
              <p> 　　A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his 
                regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has 
                walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, 
                just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, 
                and rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him 
                the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Ivan 
                Mitrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same commanders. The 
                sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is 
                sailing, but on the day of battle- heaven knows how and whence- 
                a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere 
                of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive and 
                solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the 
                day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests 
                of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly 
                ask concerning what is going on around them.</p>
              <p> 　　The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light 
                they could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic 
                trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any 
                side, one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But 
                the columns advanced for a long time, always in the same fog, 
                descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, 
                going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the 
                enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, 
                behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were moving in 
                the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that to the 
                unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going 
                too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, the Kurskies have also gone past,&quot; was 
                being said in the ranks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, 
                lads! Last night I looked at the campfires and there was no end 
                of them. A regular Moscow!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks 
                or talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council 
                of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and 
                so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried 
                out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always 
                do when going into action, especially to an attack. But when they 
                had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part 
                of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some 
                dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness 
                is communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly 
                is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, 
                and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army 
                been alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long 
                time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general 
                conviction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally 
                attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that 
                a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we 
                already come up against the French?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, one can't hear them. They'd be firing if we had.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here 
                we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It's 
                all those damned Germans' muddling! What stupid devils!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, they're 
                crowding up behind. And now here we stand hungry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry 
                are blocking the way,&quot; said an officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, those damned Germans! They don't know their own 
                country!&quot; said another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What division are you?&quot; shouted an adjutant, riding 
                up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Eighteenth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then why are you here? You should have gone on long 
                ago, now you won't get there till evening.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What stupid orders! They don't themselves know what 
                they are doing!&quot; said the officer and rode off.</p>
              <p> 　　Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in 
                Russian.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tafa-lafa! But what he's jabbering no one can make out,&quot; 
                said a soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. &quot;I'd 
                shoot them, the scoundrels!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but 
                we haven't got halfway. Fine orders!&quot; was being repeated 
                on different sides.</p>
              <p> 　　And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started 
                began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements 
                and at the Germans.</p>
              <p> 　　The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry 
                was moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that 
                our center was too far separated from our right flank and the 
                cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand 
                cavalry crossed in front of the infantry, who had to wait.</p>
              <p> 　　At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide 
                and a Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry 
                should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher 
                command, was to blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless 
                and dispirited. After an hour's delay they at last moved on, descending 
                the hill. The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more 
                densely below, where they were descending. In front in the fog 
                a shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying 
                intervals- trata... tat- and then more and more regularly and 
                rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.</p>
              <p> 　　Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and 
                having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word 
                from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late 
                spreading through the ranks, and above all being unable to see 
                anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians 
                exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted, 
                receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who 
                wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable 
                to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for 
                the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into 
                the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov was, stood on 
                the Pratzen Heights.</p>
              <p> 　　Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick 
                fog; on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be 
                seen of what was going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces 
                were, as we supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near 
                by in that sea of mist, no one knew till after eight o'clock.</p>
              <p> 　　It was nine o'clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like 
                a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz 
                where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite 
                light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun's vast orb 
                quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that 
                milky sea of mist. The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself 
                with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows 
                of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take 
                up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so 
                close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could 
                distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue 
                cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small 
                gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently 
                at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on 
                which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and he listened 
                to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of 
                his face- which in those days was still thin- moved. His gleaming 
                eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His predictions were being 
                justified. Part of the Russian force had already descended into 
                the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these 
                Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the 
                key to the position. He saw over the mist that in a hollow between 
                two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their 
                bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one direction 
                toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the 
                mist. From information he had received the evening before, from 
                the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during 
                the night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, 
                and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed 
                him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving 
                near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that 
                that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully 
                attacked. But still he did not begin the engagement.</p>
              <p> 　　Today was a great day for him- the anniversary of his coronation. 
                Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, 
                and in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the 
                field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and 
                everything succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights 
                visible above the mist, and his cold face wore that special look 
                of confident, self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face 
                of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing 
                to distract his attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, 
                now at the sun floating up out of the mist.</p>
              <p> 　　When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields 
                and mist were aglow with dazzling light- as if he had only awaited 
                this to begin the action- he drew the glove from his shapely white 
                hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action 
                to begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off 
                in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces 
                of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights 
                which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving 
                down the valley to their left. </p>

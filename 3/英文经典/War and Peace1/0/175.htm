              <p> 　　After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went 
                to Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to 
                meet Anatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On 
                reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had 
                already left the city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that 
                Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained 
                an appointment from the Minister of War and went to join the army 
                in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov, his 
                former commander who was always well disposed toward him, and 
                Kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in 
                Moldavia, to which the old general had been appointed commander 
                in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an appointment on 
                the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge 
                Kuragin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh 
                cause it might compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he 
                wanted to meet Kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext 
                for a duel. But he again failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for 
                soon after Prince Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. 
                In a new country, amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life 
                easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken faith with him- 
                which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its 
                effects- the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying 
                to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized so 
                highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the 
                thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky 
                on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, 
                and which had filled his solitude at Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland 
                and Rome, but he even dreaded to recall them and them and the 
                bright and boundless horizons they had revealed. He was now concerned 
                only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past 
                interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those 
                past interests were closed to him. It was as if that lofty, infinite 
                canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly 
                turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in which 
                all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service 
                was the simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov's 
                staff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance 
                and surprised Kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. 
                Not having found Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think 
                it necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same 
                he knew that however long it might be before he met Kuragin, despite 
                his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to 
                convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict 
                with him- he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able 
                to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help 
                snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not 
                yet avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his 
                heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed 
                to obtain in Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather 
                vainglorious and ambitious activity.</p>
              <p> 　　In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached 
                Bucharest- where Kutuzov had been living for two months, passing 
                his days and nights with a Wallachian woman- Prince Andrew asked 
                Kutuzov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was 
                already weary of Bolkonski's activity which seemed to reproach 
                his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission 
                to Barclay de Tolly.</p>
              <p> 　　Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped 
                at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly 
                on his way, being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad. During 
                the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, 
                he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in 
                the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck 
                him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged 
                and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates 
                with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the 
                house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The 
                same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness 
                reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same 
                walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat 
                older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden getting 
                on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of 
                her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                was the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment 
                of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She 
                had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. 
                Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing 
                a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, 
                but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and 
                pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only 
                by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side 
                of his mouth; in character he was the same as ever, only showing 
                still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening 
                in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown, 
                become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, 
                quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little 
                mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not 
                obey the law of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. 
                But though externally all remained as of old, the inner relations 
                of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew had seen them 
                last. The household was divided into two alien and hostile camps, 
                who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he 
                was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince, Madmoiselle 
                Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Mary, Dessalles, 
                little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.</p>
              <p> 　　During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, 
                but they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a 
                visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his 
                presence made them all feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this 
                at dinner on the first day, he was taciturn, and the old prince 
                noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments 
                directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince Andrew went 
                to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the young 
                Count Kamensky's campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to 
                talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and 
                her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only 
                person really attached to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because 
                of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, 
                and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little 
                Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented 
                his daughter and that her life was very hard, but he also knew 
                that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it. 
                &quot;Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me 
                about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool 
                who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance 
                and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn't understand, 
                so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,&quot; thought the 
                old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put up with 
                his daughter's unreasonable character.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you ask me,&quot; said Prince Andrew, without looking 
                up (he was censuring his father for the first time in his life), 
                &quot;I did not wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will 
                give you my frank opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and 
                discord between you and Mary, I can't blame her for it at all. 
                I know how she loves and respects you. Since you ask me,&quot; 
                continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable- as he was always 
                liable to do of late- &quot;I can only say that if there are any 
                misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who 
                is not fit to be my sister's companion.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural 
                smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince 
                Andrew could not get accustomed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've already been 
                talking it over! Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I did not want to judge,&quot; said Prince Andrew, 
                in a hard and bitter tone, &quot;but you challenged me, and I 
                have said, and always shall say, that Mary is not to blame, but 
                those to blame- the one to blame- is that Frenchwoman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!&quot; 
                said the old man in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, 
                with some embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: 
                &quot;Be off, be off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded 
                him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who 
                did not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                and Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. 
                Next day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms. 
                The boy, curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, 
                sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began telling him the story 
                of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without finishing the story. 
                He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his 
                knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for 
                having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first 
                time in his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find 
                neither. What meant still more to him was that he sought and did 
                not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he 
                had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his 
                knee.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, go on!&quot; said his son.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee 
                and went out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, 
                and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid 
                which he had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its 
                former intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories 
                and to find some work as soon as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you've decided to go, Andrew?&quot; asked his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God that I can,&quot; replied Prince Andrew. &quot;I 
                am very sorry you can't.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; replied Princess Mary. &quot;Why 
                do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and 
                he is so old? Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about 
                you....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and 
                her tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing 
                the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what- what 
                trash- can cause people misery!&quot; he said with a malignity 
                that alarmed Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　She understood that when speaking of &quot;trash&quot; he 
                referred not only to Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her 
                misery, but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!&quot; she 
                said, touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone 
                through her tears. &quot;I understand you&quot; (she looked down). 
                &quot;Don't imagine that sorrow is the work of men. Men are His 
                tools.&quot; She looked a little above Prince Andrew's head with 
                the confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place 
                where a familiar portrait hangs. &quot;Sorrow is sent by Him, 
                not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If 
                you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have 
                no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman's 
                virtue. But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,&quot; 
                he replied, and though till that moment he had not been thinking 
                of Kuragin, all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his 
                heart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If Mary is already persuading me forgive, it means that 
                I ought long ago to have punished him,&quot; he thought. And giving 
                her no further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive 
                moment when he would meet Kuragin who he knew was now in the army.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that 
                she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without 
                being reconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would 
                probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly 
                write to his father, but that the longer he stayed now the more 
                embittered their differences would become.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from 
                God, and men are never to blame,&quot; were the last words he 
                heard from his sister when he took leave of her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then it must be so!&quot; thought Prince Andrew as he 
                drove out of the avenue from the house at Bald Hills. &quot;She, 
                poor innocent creature, is left to be victimized by an old man 
                who has outlived his wits. The old man feels he is guilty, but 
                cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices in life, 
                in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And 
                I am off to the army. Why? I myself don't know. I want to meet 
                that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and 
                laugh at me!</p>
              <p> 　　These conditions of life had been the same before, but then 
                they were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. 
                Only senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves 
                one after another to Prince Andrew's mind. </p>

              <p> 　　The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the 
                outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting 
                mixed, and retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his 
                fear, uttered the senseless cry, &quot;Cut off!&quot; that is 
                so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd 
                with a feeling of panic.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Surrounded! Cut off? We're lost!&quot; shouted the fugitives.</p>
              <p> 　　The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the 
                general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, 
                and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years' service 
                who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters 
                for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting 
                the recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, 
                and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, 
                he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, 
                galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, 
                but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know what was 
                happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he 
                had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years' 
                service, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.</p>
              <p> 　　Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field 
                behind the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were 
                running and descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation 
                which decides the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly 
                crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would 
                they, disregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate 
                shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite 
                his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to 
                his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers 
                all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying 
                orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles 
                was evidently culminating in a panic.</p>
              <p> 　　The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting 
                and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed 
                lost. But at that moment the French who were attacking, suddenly 
                and without any apparent reason, ran back and disappeared from 
                the outskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in 
                the copse. It was Timokhin's company, which alone had maintained 
                its order in the wood and, having lain in ambush in a ditch, now 
                attacked the French unexpectedly. Timokhin, armed only with a 
                sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such 
                mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French 
                had thrown down their muskets and run. Dolokhov, running beside 
                Timokhin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first 
                to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives 
                returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly 
                cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve 
                units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental 
                commander and Major Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge, letting 
                the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up 
                and took hold of the commander's stirrup, almost leaning against 
                him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no 
                knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder 
                a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer's sword in 
                his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently 
                into the commander's face, and his lips were smiling. Though the 
                commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov, 
                he could not help taking notice of the soldier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, here are two trophies,&quot; said Dolokhov, 
                pointing to the French sword and pouch. &quot;I have taken an 
                officer prisoner. I stopped the company.&quot; Dolokhov breathed 
                heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences. &quot;The 
                whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember this, 
                your excellency!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right,&quot; replied the commander, and 
                turned to Major Ekonomov.</p>
              <p> 　　But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around 
                his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his 
                hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, 
                your excellency!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Tushin's battery had been forgotten and only at the very end 
                of the action did Prince Bagration, still hearing the cannonade 
                in the center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince 
                Andrew also, to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible. 
                When the supports attached to Tushin's battery had been moved 
                away in the middle of the action by someone's order, the battery 
                had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because 
                the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery 
                to continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, 
                the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose 
                that here- in the center- the main Russian forces were concentrated. 
                Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion 
                had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns 
                on the hillock.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded 
                in setting fire to Schon Grabern.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at them scurrying! It's burning! Just see the smoke! 
                Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!&quot; exclaimed the 
                artillerymen, brightening up.</p>
              <p> 　　All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired 
                in the direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other 
                on, the soldiers cried at each shot: &quot;Fine! That's good! 
                Look at it... Grand!&quot; The fire, fanned by the breeze, was 
                rapidly spreading. The French columns that had advanced beyond 
                the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure, 
                the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began 
                firing them at Tushin's battery.</p>
              <p> 　　In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck 
                in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only 
                noticed this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell 
                among our guns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing 
                off a munition-wagon driver's leg. Their spirits once roused were, 
                however, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses 
                were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded 
                were carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun 
                battery. Tushin's companion officer had been killed at the beginning 
                of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men 
                of the guns' crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were 
                still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French 
                appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.</p>
              <p> 　　Little Tushin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his 
                orderly to &quot;refill my pipe for that one!&quot; and then, 
                scattering sparks from it, ran forward shading his eyes with his 
                small hand to look at the French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Smack at 'em, lads!&quot; he kept saying, seizing the 
                guns by the wheels and working the screws himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always 
                made him jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from 
                gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders 
                about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, 
                and shouting in his feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. 
                His face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed 
                or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting 
                angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about 
                lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome 
                fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a 
                head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer- 
                all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing 
                situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected 
                on theirs.</p>
              <p> 　　Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration 
                and activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant 
                sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly 
                wounded never occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more 
                and more elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time 
                ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired 
                the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on was 
                well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of everything, 
                considered everything, and did everything the best of officers 
                could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium 
                or drunkenness.</p>
              <p> 　　From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the 
                whistle and thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed 
                and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from 
                the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs 
                of smoke on the enemy's side (always followed by a ball flying 
                past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the 
                sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken 
                possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. 
                The enemy's guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which 
                occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There... he's puffing again,&quot; muttered Tushin to 
                himself, as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in 
                a streak to the left by the wind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now look out for the ball... we'll throw it back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you want, your honor?&quot; asked an artilleryman, 
                standing close by, who heard him muttering.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing... only a shell...&quot; he answered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come along, our Matvevna!&quot; he said to himself. 
                &quot;Matvevna&quot;* was the name his fancy gave to the farthest 
                gun of the battery, which was large and of an old pattern. The 
                French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants. In that 
                world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun's crew 
                was &quot;uncle&quot;; Tushin looked at him more often than at 
                anyone else and took delight in his every movement. The sound 
                of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, 
                seemed like someone's breathing. He listened intently to the ebb 
                and flow of these sounds. </p>
              <p> 　　*Daughter of Matthew. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! Breathing again, breathing!&quot; he muttered to 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who 
                was throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, Matvevna, dear old lady, don't let me down!&quot; 
                he was saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar 
                voice called above his head: &quot;Captain Tushin! Captain!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tushin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who 
                had turned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in 
                a gasping voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, 
                and you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are they down on me?&quot; thought Tushin, looking 
                in alarm at his superior.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I... don't...&quot; he muttered, holding up two fingers 
                to his cap. &quot;I...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. 
                A cannon ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend 
                over his horse. He paused, and just as he was about to say something 
                more, another ball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped 
                off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Retire! All to retire!&quot; he shouted from a distance.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived 
                with the same order.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up 
                to the space where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed 
                horse with a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the 
                harnessed horses. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. 
                Among the limbers lay several dead men. One ball after another 
                passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run 
                down his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid roused him 
                again. &quot;I cannot be afraid,&quot; thought he, and dismounted 
                slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did not leave 
                the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their positions 
                and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Tushin, stepping 
                across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he 
                attended to the removal of the guns.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,&quot; 
                said an artilleryman to Prince Andrew. &quot;Not like your honor!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin. They were both so busy 
                as to seem not to notice one another. When having limbered up 
                the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they 
                began moving down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn 
                were left behind), Prince Andrew rode up to Tushin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, till we meet again...&quot; he said, holding out 
                his hand to Tushin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, my dear fellow,&quot; said Tushin. &quot;Dear 
                soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!&quot; and for some unknown reason 
                tears suddenly filled his eyes.</p>

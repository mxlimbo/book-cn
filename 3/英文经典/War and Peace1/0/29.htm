              <p> 　　In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages 
                and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments 
                freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of 
                Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. 
                Braunau was the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had 
                just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting 
                to be inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian 
                appearance of the locality and surroundings- fruit gardens, stone 
                fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance- and despite the 
                fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) 
                were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any 
                Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart 
                of Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening of the last day's march an order had been received 
                that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the 
                march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental 
                commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be 
                in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between 
                the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, 
                on the principle that it is always better to &quot;bow too low 
                than not bow low enough.&quot; So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile 
                march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing 
                their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated 
                and reckoned, and by morning the regiment- instead of the straggling, 
                disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before- 
                presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom 
                knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap 
                in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally 
                was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to 
                look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean 
                shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, 
                &quot;awl, soap, and all,&quot; as the soldiers say. There was 
                only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. 
                It was the state of the soldiers' boots. More than half the men's 
                boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault 
                of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands 
                boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the 
                regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.</p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, 
                and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and 
                wider from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on 
                a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded 
                and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie 
                down on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man happily 
                performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked 
                about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, 
                slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired 
                his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed 
                by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military 
                matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part 
                of his thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?&quot; he said, addressing 
                one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward 
                (it was plain that they both felt happy). &quot;We had our hands 
                full last night. However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, 
                eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin 
                Meadow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot; asked the commander.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers 
                had been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an 
                aide-decamp followed by a Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not 
                been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander 
                in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which 
                it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and 
                without any preparation whatever.</p>
              <p> 　　A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov 
                the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with 
                the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not 
                considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments 
                in support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched 
                state in which the troops arrived from Russia. With this object 
                he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it 
                was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would be. Though 
                the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless 
                delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats 
                and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise 
                be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander hung 
                his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his 
                arms with a choleric gesture.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A fine mess we've made of it!&quot; he remarked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that 
                if it was said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?&quot; said 
                he reproachfully to the battalion commander. &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; 
                he added, stepping resolutely forward. &quot;Company commanders!&quot; 
                he shouted in a voice accustomed to command. &quot;Sergeants major!... 
                How soon will he be here?&quot; he asked the aide-de-camp with 
                a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he 
                was referring to.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In an hour's time, I should say.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall we have time to change clothes?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know, General....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered 
                the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders 
                ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling 
                (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly 
                the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent 
                began to sway and stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers 
                were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk 
                of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping 
                their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.</p>
              <p> 　　In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had 
                become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked 
                with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined 
                it from a distance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whatever is this? This!&quot; he shouted and stood still. 
                &quot;Commander of the third company!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... 
                commander to the general... third company to the commander.&quot; 
                The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for 
                the missing officer.</p>
              <p> 　　When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination 
                in a cry of: &quot;The general to the third company,&quot; the 
                missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he 
                was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted 
                awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general. The captain's 
                face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat 
                a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness 
                of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched 
                nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he came 
                up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What 
                is this?&quot; shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward 
                his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company 
                in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. 
                &quot;What have you been after? The commander in chief is expected 
                and you leave your place? Eh? I'll teach you to dress the men 
                in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, 
                pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in 
                this pressure lay his only hope of salvation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, why don't you speak? Whom have you got there dressed 
                up as a Hungarian?&quot; said the commander with an austere gibe.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what 
                about your excellency?... nobody knows.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, who has 
                been reduced to the ranks,&quot; said the captain softly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or 
                into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation 
                uniform like the others.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the 
                march.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you young men,&quot; 
                said the regimental commander cooling down a little. &quot;Leave 
                indeed.... One says a word to you and you... What?&quot; he added 
                with renewed irritation, &quot;I beg you to dress your men decently.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed 
                his jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his 
                own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to 
                find a further excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer 
                for an unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, 
                he reached the third company.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your leg? Your leg?&quot; 
                shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while 
                there were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray 
                uniform.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight 
                with his clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change 
                his coat... the ras...&quot; he did not finish.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...&quot; 
                Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not bound to endure insults,&quot; Dolokhov concluded 
                in loud, ringing tones.</p>
              <p> 　　The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became 
                silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,&quot; 
                he said as he turned away. </p>

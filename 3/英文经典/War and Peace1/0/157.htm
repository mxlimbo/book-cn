              <p> 　　The day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody 
                came to see them. Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something 
                which they concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking 
                about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted 
                and offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and 
                twice that day sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain 
                whether he had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now 
                than during her first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining 
                for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview 
                with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety 
                of which she did not understand the cause. She continually fancied 
                that either he would never come or that something would happen 
                to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by herself 
                calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she 
                began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of 
                Princess Mary, of the theater, and of Kuragin mingled with her 
                thoughts. The question again presented itself whether she was 
                not guilty, whether she had not already broken faith with Prince 
                Andrew, and again she found herself recalling to the minutest 
                detail every word, every gesture, and every shade in the play 
                of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse 
                in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To the 
                family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less 
                tranquil and happy than before.</p>
              <p> 　　On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to 
                Mass at her parish church- the Church of the Assumption built 
                over the graves of victims of the plague.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't like those fashionable churches,&quot; she said, 
                evidently priding herself on her independence of thought. &quot;God 
                is the same every where. We have an excellent priest, he conducts 
                the service decently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. 
                What holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir? I don't 
                like it, it's just self-indulgence!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. 
                Her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither 
                she nor the servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and 
                went to church. At her table there were extra dishes at dinner, 
                and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig. But 
                in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in Marya 
                Dmitrievna's broad, stern face, which on that day wore an invariable 
                look of solemn festivity.</p>
              <p> 　　After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining 
                room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, 
                a servant announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna 
                rose with a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she 
                paid calls, and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas 
                Bolkonski to have an explanation with him about Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet 
                waited on the Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, 
                having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied 
                herself trying on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice 
                without sleeves and only tacked together, and was turning her 
                head to see in the glass how the back fitted, she heard in the 
                drawing room the animated sounds of her father's voice and another's- 
                a woman's- that made her flush. It was Helene. Natasha had not 
                time to take off the bodice before the door opened and Countess 
                Bezukhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar, 
                came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, my enchantress!&quot; she cried to the blushing 
                Natasha. &quot;Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my 
                dear count,&quot; said she to Count Rostov who had followed her 
                in. &quot;How can you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No, I won't 
                let you off! Mademoiselle George will recite at my house tonight 
                and there'll be some people, and if you don't bring your lovely 
                girls- who are prettier than Mademoiselle George- I won't know 
                you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you. 
                You must come. You positively must! Between eight and nine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied 
                respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside 
                the looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. 
                She did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually 
                praising Natasha's beauty. She looked at Natasha's dresses and 
                praised them, as well as a new dress of her own made of &quot;metallic 
                gauze,&quot; which she had received from Paris, and advised Natasha 
                to have one like it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But anything suits you, my charmer!&quot; she remarked.</p>
              <p> 　　A smile of pleasure never left Natasha's face. She felt happy 
                and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess 
                Bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and 
                important and was now so kind to her. Natasha brightened up and 
                felt almost in love with this woman, who was so beautiful and 
                so kind. Helene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha 
                and wished to give her a good time. Anatole had asked her to bring 
                him and Natasha together, and she was calling on the Rostovs for 
                that purpose. The idea of throwing her brother and Natasha together 
                amused her.</p>
              <p> 　　Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with 
                Natasha for drawing Boris away, she did not think of that now, 
                and in her own way heartily wished Natasha well. As she was leaving 
                the Rostovs she called her protegee aside.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My brother dined with me yesterday- we nearly died of 
                laughter- he ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! 
                He is madly, quite madly, in love with you, my dear.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!&quot; said 
                Helene. &quot;You must certainly come. If you love somebody, my 
                charmer, that is not a reason to shut yourself up. Even if you 
                are engaged, I am sure your fiance would wish you to go into society 
                rather than be bored to death.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre- 
                that good Pierre- have talked and laughed about this. So it's 
                all right.&quot; And again, under Helene's influence, what had 
                seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural. &quot;And she is 
                such a grande dame, so kind, and evidently likes me so much. And 
                why not enjoy myself?&quot; thought Natasha, gazing at Helene 
                with wide-open, wondering eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, 
                having evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince's. She was 
                still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the 
                affair calmly. In answer to the count's inquiries she replied 
                that things were all right and that she would tell about it next 
                day. On hearing of Countess Bezukhova's visit and the invitation 
                for that evening, Marya Dmitrievna remarked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and 
                don't advise you to; however, if you've promised- go. It will 
                divert your thoughts,&quot; she added, addressing Natasha. </p>

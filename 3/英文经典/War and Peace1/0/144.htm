              <p> 　　When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovna's, Natasha, 
                who always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame 
                Schoss should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sonya with 
                Nicholas and the maids.</p>
              <p> 　　On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of 
                racing and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light 
                into Sonya's face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache 
                for his former and his present Sonya from whom he had resolved 
                never to be parted again. He looked and recognizing in her both 
                the old and the new Sonya, and being reminded by the smell of 
                burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air 
                with a full breast and, looking at the ground flying beneath him 
                and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in fairyland.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, is it well with thee?&quot; he asked from time 
                to time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes!&quot; she replied. &quot;And with thee?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman 
                and ran for a moment to Natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha!&quot; he whispered in French, &quot;do you 
                know I have made up my mind about Sonya?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you told her?&quot; asked Natasha, suddenly beaming 
                all over with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those 
                eyebrows!... Natasha- are you glad?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with 
                you. I did not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. 
                What a heart she has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was 
                ashamed to be happy while Sonya was not,&quot; continued Natasha. 
                &quot;Now I am so glad! Well, run back to her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!&quot; cried 
                Nicholas, peering into her face and finding in his sister too 
                something new, unusual, and bewitchingly tender that he had not 
                seen in her before. &quot;Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;You have done splendidly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Had I seen her before as she is now,&quot; thought Nicholas, 
                &quot;I should long ago have asked her what to do and have done 
                whatever she told me, and all would have been well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you are glad and I have done right?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time 
                ago about it. Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she 
                say such a thing! I nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let 
                anyone say anything bad of Sonya, for there is nothing but good 
                in her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then it's all right?&quot; said Nicholas, again scrutinizing 
                the expression of his sister's face to see if she was in earnest. 
                Then he jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back 
                to his sleigh. The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache 
                and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood, was still 
                sitting there, and that Circassian was Sonya, and that Sonya was 
                certainly his future happy and loving wife.</p>
              <p> 　　When they reached home and had told their mother how they 
                had spent the evening at the Melyukovs', the girls went to their 
                bedroom. When they had undressed, but without washing off the 
                cork mustaches, they sat a long time talking of their happiness. 
                They talked of how they would live when they were married, how 
                their husbands would be friends, and how happy they would be. 
                On Natasha's table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had 
                prepared beforehand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It 
                would be too good!&quot; said Natasha, rising and going to the 
                looking glasses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him,&quot; said 
                Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking 
                glasses, and sat down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I see someone with a mustache,&quot; said Natasha, seeing 
                her own face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You mustn't laugh, Miss,&quot; said Dunyasha.</p>
              <p> 　　With Sonya's help and the maid's, Natasha got the glass she 
                held into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed 
                a serious expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking 
                at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting 
                (from tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, 
                in that last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she 
                was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a 
                coffin, she saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly and moved 
                away from the looking glasses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is it others see things and I don't?&quot; she said. 
                &quot;You sit down now, Sonya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do 
                it for me.... Today I feel so frightened!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, 
                and began looking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something,&quot; whispered 
                Dunyasha; &quot;while you do nothing but laugh.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya heard this and Natasha's whisper:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know she will. She saw something last year.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　For about three minutes all were silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course she will!&quot; whispered Natasha, but did 
                not finish... suddenly Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding 
                and covered her eyes with her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Natasha!&quot; she cried.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Did you see? Did you? What was it?&quot; exclaimed Natasha, 
                holding up the looking glass.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink 
                and to get up when she heard Natasha say, &quot;Of course she 
                will!&quot; She did not wish to disappoint either Dunyasha or 
                Natasha, but it was hard to sit still. She did not herself know 
                how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You saw him?&quot; urged Natasha, seizing her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,&quot; Sonya could not 
                help saying, not yet knowing whom Natasha meant by him, Nicholas 
                or Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why shouldn't I say I saw something? Others do see! 
                Besides who can tell whether I saw anything or not?&quot; flashed 
                through Sonya's mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I saw him,&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How? Standing or lying?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw 
                him lying down.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew lying? Is he ill?&quot; asked Natasha, her frightened 
                eyes fixed on her friend.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, 
                and he turned to me.&quot; And when saying this she herself fancied 
                she had really seen what she described.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and then, Sonya?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;After that, I could not make out what there was; something 
                blue and red...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! 
                O, God, how afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...&quot; 
                Natasha began, and without replying to Sonya's words of comfort 
                she got into bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed 
                and motionless, gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.</p>

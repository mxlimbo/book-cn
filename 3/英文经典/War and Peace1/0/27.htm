              <p> 　　At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered 
                the dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and 
                Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with 
                his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer's was 
                admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual 
                was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that 
                honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social 
                distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials 
                to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivanovich (who 
                always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) 
                to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more 
                than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivanovich was 
                &quot;not a whit worse than you or I.&quot; At dinner the prince 
                usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivanovich more often than 
                to anyone else.</p>
              <p> 　　In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house 
                was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen- 
                one behind each chair- stood waiting for the prince to enter. 
                The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the 
                table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from 
                the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter. Prince 
                Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing 
                the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkonski, opposite which 
                hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently 
                by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling 
                prince, in a crown- an alleged descendant of Rurik and ancestor 
                of the Bolkonskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical 
                tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a 
                portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How thoroughly like him that is!&quot; he said to Princess 
                Mary, who had come up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not 
                understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did 
                inspired her with reverence and was beyond question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everyone has his Achilles' heel,&quot; continued Prince 
                Andrew. &quot;Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such 
                nonsense!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's 
                criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps 
                were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly 
                and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting 
                the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his 
                house. At that moment the great clock struck two and another with 
                a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood 
                still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy 
                eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little 
                princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the 
                sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all 
                around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly 
                on the back of her neck.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm glad, glad, to see you,&quot; he said, looking attentively 
                into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. 
                &quot;Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ianovich!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A 
                footman moved the chair for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ho, ho!&quot; said the old man, casting his eyes on 
                her rounded figure. &quot;You've been in a hurry. That's bad!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his 
                lips only and not with his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as 
                possible,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his 
                words. She was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her 
                about her father, and she began to smile and talk. He asked about 
                mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered 
                away giving him greetings from various people and retailing the 
                town gossip.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband 
                and she has cried her eyes out,&quot; she said, growing more and 
                more lively.</p>
              <p> 　　As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more 
                sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and 
                had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed 
                Michael Ivanovich.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having 
                a bad time of it. Prince Andrew&quot; (he always spoke thus of 
                his son) &quot;has been telling me what forces are being collected 
                against him! While you and I never thought much of him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when &quot;you and I&quot; 
                had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he 
                was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince's favorite topic, 
                he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would 
                follow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a great tactician!&quot; said the prince to his 
                son, pointing to the architect.</p>
              <p> 　　And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, 
                and the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed 
                convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies 
                who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte 
                was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there 
                were no longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him; but 
                he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties 
                in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which 
                the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real. 
                Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father's ridicule of the new 
                men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The past always seems good,&quot; said he, &quot;but 
                did not Suvorov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from 
                which he did not know how to escape?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who told you that? Who?&quot; cried the prince. &quot;Suvorov!&quot; 
                And he jerked away his plate, which Tikhon briskly caught. &quot;Suvorov!... 
                Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvorov; Moreau!... 
                Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; 
                but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It 
                would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you'll 
                find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvorov couldn't 
                manage them so what chance has Michael Kutuzov? No, my dear boy,&quot; 
                he continued, &quot;you and your generals won't get on against 
                Buonaparte; you'll have to call in the French, so that birds of 
                a feather may fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent 
                to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,&quot; 
                he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to 
                enter the Russian service.... &quot;Wonderful!... Were the Potemkins, 
                Suvorovs, and Orlovs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have 
                all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, 
                but we'll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great 
                commander among them! Hm!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't at all say that all the plans are good,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew, &quot;I am only surprised at your opinion 
                of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same 
                Bonaparte is a great generall&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Michael Ivanovich!&quot; cried the old prince to the 
                architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: 
                &quot;Didn't I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, 
                he says same thing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To be sure, your excellency.&quot; replied the architect.</p>
              <p> 　　The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 
                He has got splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. 
                And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world 
                began everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one- except 
                one another. He made his reputation fighting them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according 
                to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. 
                His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments 
                were presented he was as little able as his father to change his 
                opinion. He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily 
                wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so 
                many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all 
                the recent European military and political events.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You think I'm an old man and don't understand the present 
                state of affairs?&quot; concluded his father. &quot;But it troubles 
                me. I don't sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander 
                of yours shown his skill?&quot; he concluded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That would take too long to tell,&quot; answered the 
                son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then go to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                here's another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,&quot; 
                he exclaimed in excellent French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dieu sait quand reviendra&quot;... hummed the prince 
                out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest 
                of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now 
                at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left 
                the table she took her sister-in-law's arm and drew her into another 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a clever man your father is,&quot; said she; &quot;perhaps 
                that is why I am afraid of him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, he is so kind!&quot; answered Princess Mary. </p>

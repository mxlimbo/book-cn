          <td>1802.-- 
            <p>]This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend 
              in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came 
              within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside public 
              house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart 
              of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked: </p>
            <p>`Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're allas three wick after other 
              folk wi' ther harvest.' </p>
            <p>`Gimmerton ?` I repeated--my residence in that locality had already 
              grown dim and dreamy. `Ah! I know. How far is it from this?' </p>
            <p>`Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered. 
            </p>
            <p>A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was 
              scarcely noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night 
              under my own roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily 
              to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble 
              of invading the neighbourhood again. Having rested a while, I directed 
              my servant to inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue 
              to our beasts, we managed the distance in some three hours. </p>
            <p>I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey 
              church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished 
              a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, 
              warm weather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder 
              me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen 
              it nearer August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month 
              among its solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing 
              more divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, 
              bold swells of heath. </p>
            <p>I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; 
              but the family had retreated' into the back premises, I judged, 
              by one thin, blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney, and they 
              did not hear. I rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of 
              nine or ten sat knitting, and an old woman reclined on the house 
              steps, smoking a meditative pipe. </p>
            <p>`Is Mrs Dean within?' I demanded of the dame. </p>
            <p>`Mistress Dean? Nay!' she answered, `shoo doesn't bide here: shoo's 
              up at th' Heights.' </p>
            <p>`Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued. </p>
            <p>`Ea, Aw keep th' house,' she replied. </p>
            <p>`Well, I'm Mr Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge 
              me in, I wonder? I wish to stay here all night.' </p>
            <p>`T' maister!' she cried in astonishment. `Whet, whoiver knew yah 
              wur coming? Yah sud ha' send word. They's nowt norther dry nor mensful 
              abaht t' place: nowt there isn't!' </p>
            <p>She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and 
              I entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, 
              that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bid 
              her be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime, she must 
              try to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and 
              a bedroom to sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and 
              dry sheets were necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though 
              she thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, 
              and malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired, 
              confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return. Wuthering 
              Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An afterthought brought 
              me back, when I had quitted the court. </p>
            <p>`All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman. </p>
            <p>`Eea, f'r owt Ee knaw,' she answered, skurrying away with a pan 
              of hot cinders. </p>
            <p>I would have asked why Mrs Dean had deserted the Grange, but it 
              was impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and 
              made my exit, rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking 
              sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, 
              and the other brightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the 
              stony by-road branching off to Mr Heathcliff's dwelling. Before 
              I arrived in sight of it, all that remained of day was a beamless 
              amber light along the west: but I could see every pebble on the 
              path, and every blade of grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither 
              to climb the gate nor to knock--it yielded to my hand. That is an 
              improvement, I thought. And I noticed another, by the aid of my 
              nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air 
              from amongst the homely fruit trees. </p>
            <p>Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case 
              in a coal district, a fine, red fire illumined the chimney: the 
              comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. 
              But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large, that the inmates 
              have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly, 
              what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one 
              of the windows. I could both see them and hear them talk before 
              I entered, and looked and listened in consequence; being moved thereto 
              by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered. 
            </p>
            <p>`Con-trary!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell--`That for 
              the third time, you dunce! I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, 
              or I'll pull your hair!' </p>
            <p>`Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 
              `And now, kiss me, for minding so well.' </p>
            <p>`No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.' </p>
            <p>The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably 
              dressed and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome 
              features glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering 
              from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled 
              him by a smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such 
              signs of inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining 
              ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent 
              to superintend his studies; and her face--it was lucky he could 
              not see her face, or he would never have been so steady. I could: 
              and I bit my lip in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might 
              have had of doing something besides staring at its smiling beauty. 
            </p>
            <p>The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil 
              claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses: which, however, 
              he generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their 
              conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk 
              on the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's 
              heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions, 
              if I showed my `unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and 
              feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge 
              in the kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also, 
              and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing 
              a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of 
              scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents. </p>
            <p>`Aw'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev `em swearing i' my lugs frough 
              morn to neeght, nur hearken yah, hahsiver!' said the tenant of the 
              kitchen, in answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's. `It's a blazing 
              shaime, ut Aw cannut oppen t' blessed Book, bud yah set up them 
              glories tuh Sattan, un' all t' flaysome wickednesses ut iver wer 
              born intuh t' warld! Oh! yah'er a raight nowt; un' shoo's another; 
              un' that poor lad'll be lost atween ye. Poor lad!' he added, with 
              a groan; `he's witched: Aw'm sartin on't! O Lord, judge `em, fur 
              they's norther law nur justice amang wer rullers!' </p>
            <p>`No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted 
              the singer. `But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, 
              and never mind me. This is &quot;Fairy Annie's `Wedding&quot;--a 
              bonny tune--it goes to a dance.' </p>
            <p>Mrs Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognizing 
              me directly, she jumped to her feet, crying: </p>
            <p>`Why, bless you, Mr Lockwood! How could you think of returning 
              in this way? All's shut up at Thrushcross Grange. You should have 
              given us notice!' </p>
            <p>`I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall 
              stay,' I answered. `I depart again tomorrow. And how are you transplanted 
              here, Mrs Dean? tell me that.' </p>
            <p>`Zillah left, and Mr Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you 
              went to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! 
              Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?' </p>
            <p>`From the Grange,' I replied; `and while they make me lodging room 
              there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I 
              don't think of having another opportunity in a hurry.' </p>
            <p>`What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 
              `He's gone out at present, and won't return soon.' </p>
            <p>`About the rent,' I answered. </p>
            <p>`Oh! then it is with Mrs Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 
              `or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, 
              and I act for her: there's nobody else.' </p>
            <p>I looked surprised. </p>
            <p>`Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued. 
            </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished. `How long ago?' </p>
            <p>`Three months since: but sit down and let me take your hat, and 
              I'll tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have 
              you?' </p>
            <p>`I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. 
              I never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You 
              say you don't expect them back for some time--the young people?' 
            </p>
            <p>`No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: 
              but they don't care for me. At least have a drink of our old ale; 
              it will do you good: you seem weary.' </p>
            <p>She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph 
              asking whether `it warn't a crying scandal that she should have 
              fellies at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out uh' 
              t' maister's cellar! He fair shaamed to `bide still and see it.' 
            </p>
            <p>She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing 
              a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness. 
              And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of HeathclifFs history. 
              He had a `queer' end, as she expressed it. </p>
            <p>I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your 
              leaving us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. 
              My first interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered 
              so much since our separation. Mr Heathcliff did not explain his 
              reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told 
              me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make 
              the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was 
              enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day. She seemed 
              pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a 
              great number of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement 
              at the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable 
              comfort. The delusion did not last long. Catherine, contented at 
              first, in a brief space grew irritable and restless. For one thing, 
              she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and it fretted her 
              sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on; for 
              another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her frequently, 
              and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling with 
              Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude. I did 
              not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek 
              the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself; 
              and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, 
              or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing 
              him--and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after 
              a while she changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting 
              him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; 
              expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived--how 
              he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing. </p>
            <p>`He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, `or 
              a carthorse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! 
              What a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? 
              And, if you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!' </p>
            <p>Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor 
              look again. </p>
            <p>`He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued. `He twitched his 
              shoulder as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.' </p>
            <p>`Mr Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don't 
              behave!' I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched 
              his fist, as if tempted to use it. </p>
            <p>`I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she 
              exclaimed, on another occasion. `He is afraid I shall laugh at him. 
              Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; 
              and because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was 
              he not a fool?' </p>
            <p>`Were not you naughty?' I said; `answer me that.' </p>
            <p>`Perhaps I was,' she went on; `but I did not expect him to be so 
              silly. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll 
              try!' </p>
            <p>She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, 
              and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I shall put it here,' she said, `in the table drawer; 
              and I'm going to bed.' </p>
            <p>Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. 
              But he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, 
              to her great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering 
              sulkiness and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening 
              him off improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her 
              ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued 
              other stationary employments I could not well do in the parlour, 
              she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. `When 
              Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting part, 
              and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was 
              as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in 
              wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, 
              one on each side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand 
              her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing 
              his best to seem to disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed 
              his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased 
              me to talk to her, and ran off into the court or garden, the moment 
              I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and said she was tired 
              of living: her life was useless. </p>
            <p>Mr Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had 
              almost banished Earnshaw out of his apartment. Owing to an accident 
              at the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture 
              in the kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; 
              a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before 
              he could reach home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was 
              condemned to the fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. 
              It suited Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her 
              hate her room upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to 
              find out business below, that she might accompany me. </p>
            <p>On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; 
              and, in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. 
              Earnshaw sat, morose as usual, at the chimney-corner, and my little 
              mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the 
              window panes; varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, 
              and whispered ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience 
              in the direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked 
              into the grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting 
              my light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention 
              on her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin: </p>
            <p>`I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that I'm glad--that I should 
              like you to be my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, 
              and so rough.' </p>
            <p>Hareton returned no answer. </p>
            <p>`Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued. `Get off 
              wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness. </p>
            <p>`Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand 
              and abstracting it from his mouth. </p>
            <p>Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind 
              the fire. He swore at her and seized another. </p>
            <p>`Stop,' she cried, `you must listen to me first; and I can't speak 
              while those clouds are floating in my face.' </p>
            <p>`Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed ferociously, `and let 
              me be!' </p>
            <p>`No,' she persisted, `I won't: I can't tell what to do to make 
              you talk to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I 
              call you stupid, I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise 
              you. Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton! you are my cousin, 
              and you shall own me. </p>
            <p>`I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your 
              damned mocking tricks!' he answered. `I'll go to hell, body and 
              soul, before I look sideways after you again. Side out O' t' gait, 
              now; this minute!' </p>
            <p>Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her 
              lip, and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal 
              a growing tendency to sob. </p>
            <p>`You should be friends with your cousin, Mr Hareton,' I interrupted, 
              `since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal 
              of good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.' 
            </p>
            <p>`A companion?' he cried; `when she hates me, and does not think 
              me fit to wipe her shoon! Nay! if it made me a king, I'd not be 
              scorned for seeking her goodwill any more.' </p>
            <p>`It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, 
              no longer disguising her trouble. `You hate me as much as Mr Heathcliff 
              does, and more.' </p>
            <p>`You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw: `why have I made him angry, 
              by taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered 
              at and despised me, and--Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, 
              and say you worried me out of the kitchen!' </p>
            <p>`I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 
              `and I was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, 
              and beg you to forgive me: what can I do besides?' </p>
            <p>She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened 
              and scowled like a thunder cloud, and kept his fists resolutely 
              clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct, 
              must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that 
              prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, 
              she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The little 
              rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her 
              former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head reprovingly, 
              and then she blushed and whispered: </p>
            <p>`Well! what should I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake hands, 
              and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that I like him--that 
              I want to be friends.' </p>
            <p>Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very 
              careful, for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and 
              when he did raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes. 
            </p>
            <p>Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in 
              white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribband, and addressed 
              it to `Mr Hareton Earnshaw', she desired me to be her ambassadress, 
              and convey the present to its destined recipient. </p>
            <p>`And tell him, if he'll take it I'll come and teach him to read 
              it right,' she said; `and, if he refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and 
              never tease him again.' </p>
            <p>I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my 
              employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his 
              knee. He did not strike off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine 
              leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slightest 
              rustle of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly 
              seated herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: 
              all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he 
              could not summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply 
              to her questioning look, and her murmured petition. </p>
            <p>`Say you forgive me, Hareton, do? You can make me so happy by speaking 
              that little word.' </p>
            <p>He muttered something inaudible. </p>
            <p>`And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine interrogatively. </p>
            <p>`Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered; 
              `and the more, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.' </p>
            <p>`So you won't be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, 
              and creeping close up. </p>
            <p>I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round 
              again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page 
              of the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified 
              on both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies. 
            </p>
            <p>The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and 
              their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph 
              came home. He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of 
              Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning 
              her hand on his shoulder; and confounded at his favourite's endurance 
              of her proximity: it affected him too deeply to allow an observation 
              on the subject that night. His emotion was only revealed by the 
              immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly spread his large Bible on 
              the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, 
              the produce of the day's transactions. At length, he summoned Hareton 
              from his seat. </p>
            <p>`Tak' these in tuh t' maister, lad,' he said, `un' bide thar. Aw's 
              gang up tuh my awn rahm. This hoile's norther mensful nor seemly 
              fur us: we mun side aht and seearch another.' </p>
            <p>`Come, Catherine,' I said, `we must &quot;side out&quot; too; I've 
              done my ironing, are you ready to go?' </p>
            <p>`It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly. `Hareton, 
              I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring some 
              more tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>`Ony books ut yah leave, Aw suall tak' intuh th' hahse,' said Joseph, 
              `un it'll be mitch if yah find em agean; soa, yah muh plase yourseln!' 
            </p>
            <p>Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling 
              as she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, 
              I venture to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; 
              except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to Linton. </p>
            <p>The intimacy thus commenced, grew rapidly; though it encountered 
              temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a 
              wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; 
              but both their minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring 
              to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they 
              contrived in the end to reach it. </p>
            <p>You see, Mr Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs Heathcliff's 
              heart. But now, I'm glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes 
              will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding 
              day: there won't be a happier woman than myself in England! </p>

          <td>Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as 
            I proposed; my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from 
            her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman 
            was not conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood 
            open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked, 
            and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden beds; he unchained it, 
            and I entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. 
            I took particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best, 
            apparently, to make the least of his advantages. 
            <p>I asked if Mr Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he 
              would be in at dinner time. It was eleven o'clock, and I announced 
              my intention of going in and waiting for him, at which he immediately 
              flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, 
              not as a substitute for the host. </p>
            <p>We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful 
              in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked 
              more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She 
              hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment 
              with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; 
              never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment. 
            </p>
            <p>`She does not seem so amiable', I thought, `as Mrs Dean would persuade 
              me to believe. She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.' </p>
            <p>Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. `Remove 
              them yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had 
              done; and retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to 
              carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her 
              lap. I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; 
              and, as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs Dean's note on to her knee, 
              unnoticed by Hareton--but she asked aloud, `What is that?' and chucked 
              it off. </p>
            <p>`A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' 
              I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest 
              it should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have 
              gathered it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized 
              and put it in his waistcoat, saying Mr Heathcliff should look at 
              it first. Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, 
              very stealthily, drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it 
              to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling a while to keep down 
              his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor 
              beside her, as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused 
              it eagerly; then she but a few questions to me concerning the inmates, 
              rational and irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards 
              the hills, murmured in soliloquy: </p>
            <p>`I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to 
              be climbing up there! Oh! I'm tired--I'm stalled, Hareton!' And 
              she leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn 
              and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: 
              neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her. </p>
            <p>`Mrs Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, `you are 
              not aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I 
              think it strange you won't come and speak to me. My housekeeper 
              never wearies of talking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly 
              disappointed if I return with no news of or from you, except that 
              you received her letter and said nothing!' </p>
            <p>She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked: </p>
            <p>`Does Ellen like you?' </p>
            <p>`Yes, very well,' I replied unhesitatingly. </p>
            <p>`You must tell her,' she continued, `that I would answer her letter, 
              but l have no materials for writing: not even a book from which 
              I might tear a leaf.' </p>
            <p>`No books!' I exclaimed. `How do you contrive to live here without 
              them? if l may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with 
              a large library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my 
              books away, and I should be desperate!' </p>
            <p>`I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; `and Mr 
              Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my 
              books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched 
              through Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and 
              once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin 
              and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought 
              the last here--and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver 
              spoons, for the mere love of stealing! They are of no use to you; 
              or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot 
              enjoy them nobody else shall. Perhaps your envy counselled Mr Heathcliff 
              to rob me of my treasures? But I've most of them written on my brain 
              and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!' </p>
            <p>Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of 
              his private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial 
              of her accusations.' </p>
            <p>`Mr Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' 
              I said, coming to his rescue. `He is not envious but emulous of 
              your attainments. He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.' </p>
            <p>`And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine. 
              `Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty 
              blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did 
              yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you 
              turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then 
              cursing because you couldn't read their explanations!' </p>
            <p>The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed 
              at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. 
              I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs Dean's anecdote of 
              his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been 
              reared, I observed: </p>
            <p>`But, Mrs Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and each 
              stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned 
              instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.' </p>
            <p>`Oh!' she replied, `I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, 
              he has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous 
              to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, 
              both prose and verse, were consecrated to me by other associations; 
              and I hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, 
              of all, he has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most 
              to repeat, as if out of deliberate malice.' </p>
            <p>Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a 
              severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task 
              to suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his 
              embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the 
              external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the 
              room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in 
              his hands, which he threw into Catherine's lap, exclaiming: </p>
            <p>`Take them! I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!' 
            </p>
            <p>`I won't have them now,' she answered. `I shall connect them with 
              you, and hate them.' </p>
            <p>She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read 
              a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and 
              threw it from her. `And listen,' she continued provokingly, commencing 
              a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion. </p>
            <p>But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and 
              not altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy 
              tongue. The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin 
              s sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument 
              was the only mode he had of balancing the account, and repaying 
              its effects on the inflicter. He afterwards gathered the books and 
              hurled them on the fire. I read in his countenance what anguish 
              it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they 
              consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and 
              the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from 
              them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies 
              also. He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments, 
              till Catherine crossed his path. Shame at her scorn, and hope of 
              her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and, 
              instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his 
              endeavours to rise himself had produced just the contrary result. 
            </p>
            <p>`Yes; that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from 
              them!' cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the 
              conflagration with indignant eyes. </p>
            <p>`You'd better hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely. </p>
            <p>And his agitation precluding further speech, he advanced hastily 
              to the entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had 
              crossed the doorstones, Mr Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered 
              him, and laying hold of his shoulder, asked: </p>
            <p>&quot;What's to do now, my lad?' </p>
            <p>`Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and 
              anger in solitude. </p>
            <p>Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed. </p>
            <p>`It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that 
              I was behind him. `But when I look for his father in his face, I 
              find her every day more. How the devil is he so like? I can hardly 
              bear to see him.' </p>
            <p>He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was 
              a restless, anxious expression in his countenance I had never remarked 
              there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, 
              on perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the 
              kitchen, so that I remained alone. </p>
            <p>`I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr Lockwood,' he said, 
              in reply to my greeting; `from selfish motives partly: I don't think 
              I could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I've wondered 
              more than once what brought you here. </p>
            <p>`An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; `or else an idle whim 
              is going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London, next week; 
              and I must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain 
              Thrushcross Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. 
              1 believe I shall not live there any more.' </p>
            <p>`Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are 
              you?' he said. `But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place 
              you won't occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting 
              my due from anyone.' </p>
            <p>`I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably 
              irritated. `Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I 
              drew my notebook from my pocket. </p>
            <p>`No, no,' he replied coolly; `you'll leave sufficient behind to 
              cover your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry. 
              Sit down and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from 
              repeating his visit can generally be made welcome. Catherine, bring 
              the things in: where are you?' </p>
            <p>Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks. </p>
            <p>`You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff aside, 
              `and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.' </p>
            <p>She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation 
              to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably 
              cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them. 
            </p>
            <p>With Mr Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton, 
              absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, 
              and bid adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get 
              a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received 
              orders to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the 
              door, so I could not fulfil my wish. </p>
            <p>`How dreary life gets over in that house!' l reflected, while riding 
              down the road. `What a realization of something more romantic than 
              a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs Linton Heathcliff, had she 
              and I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated 
              together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!' </p>

          <td>`These things happened last winter, sir,' said Mrs Dean; `hardly 
            more than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve 
            months' end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating 
            them! Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger? You're too young 
            to rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy 
            no one could see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but 
            why do you look so lively and interested, when I talk about her? and 
            why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and 
            why--' 
            <p>`Stop, my good friend!' I cried. `It may be very possible that 
              I should love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to 
              venture my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my 
              home is not here. I'm of the busy world, and to its arms I must 
              return. Go on. Was Catherine obedient to her father's commands?' 
            </p>
            <p>`She was,' continued the housekeeper. `Her affection for him was 
              still the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: 
              he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure 
              amid perils and foes, where his remembered words would be the only 
              aid that he could bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days 
              afterwards: </p>
            <p>`&quot;I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, 
              what you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there 
              a prospect of improvement, as he grows a man?'' </p>
            <p>` ``He's very delicate, sir,'' I replied; ``and scarcely likely 
              to reach manhood; but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; 
              and if Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would 
              not be beyond her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly 
              indulgent. However, master, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted 
              with him, and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years 
              and more to his being of age.'' ' </p>
            <p>Edgar sighed; and walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton 
              Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, 
              and we could just distinguish the two fir trees in the yard, and 
              the sparely scattered gravestones. </p>
            <p>`I've prayed often', he half soliloquized, `for the approach of 
              what is coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought 
              the memory of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would 
              be less sweet than the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, 
              or, possibly, weeks, to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! 
              Ellen, I've been very happy with my little Cathy: through winter 
              nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side. But I've 
              been as happy musing by myself among those stones, under that old 
              church: lying, through the long June evenings, on the green mound 
              of her mother's grave and wishing--yearning for the time when I 
              might lie beneath it. What can I do for Cathy? How must I quit her? 
              I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's son; nor for 
              his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss. I'd 
              not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing 
              me of my last blessing! But should Linton be unworthy--only a feeble 
              tool to his father--I cannot abandon her to him! And, hard though 
              it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her 
              sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die. Darling! 
              I'd rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.' 
            </p>
            <p>Resign her to God, as it is, sir,' I answered, `and if we should 
              lose you--which may He forbid--under His providence, I'll stand 
              her friend and counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good 
              girl: I don't fear that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who 
              do their duty are always finally rewarded.' </p>
            <p>Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though 
              he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her inexperienced 
              notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek 
              was often flushed, and his eyes were bright: she felt sure of his 
              recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: 
              it was raining, and I observed: </p>
            <p>`You'll surely not go out tonight, sir?' </p>
            <p>He answered: </p>
            <p>`No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.' </p>
            <p>He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; 
              and, had the invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father 
              would have permitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he 
              returned an answer, intimating that Mr Heathcliff objected to his 
              calling at the Grange; but his uncle's kind remembrance delighted 
              him, and he hoped to meet him, sometimes, in his rambles, and personally 
              to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly 
              divided. </p>
            <p>That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff 
              knew he could plead eloquently enough for Catherine's company, then. 
            </p>
            <p>`I do not ask', he said, `that she may visit here; but, am I never 
              to see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and 
              you forbid her to come to mine? Do now and then, ride with her towards 
              the Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! 
              We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not 
              angry with me; you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. 
              Dear uncle! send me a kind note tomorrow, and leave to join you 
              anywhere you please, except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an 
              interview would convince you that my father's character is not mine: 
              he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have 
              faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, 
              and for her sake, you should also. You inquire after my health--it 
              is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and doomed 
              to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will 
              like me, how can I be cheerful and well?' </p>
            <p>Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his 
              request; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer, 
              perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing 
              at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he 
              was able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his 
              family. Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably 
              have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: 
              but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted 
              on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning 
              his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly 
              uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of 
              being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated 
              that Mr Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he 
              was purposely deceiving him with empty promises. </p>
            <p>Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and, between them, they at length 
              persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk 
              together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors 
              nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining; and though 
              he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's 
              fortune, he had a natural desire that she might retain--or at least 
              return in a short time to--the house of her ancestors; and he considered 
              her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he 
              had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; 
              nor had anyone; I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no 
              one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among 
              us. I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were false, and 
              that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned riding and 
              walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object. 
              I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically 
              and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had treated him, 
              to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more 
              imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with 
              defeat by death. </p>

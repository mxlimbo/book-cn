          <td>Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, 
            but the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still 
            uncleared. Mr Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among 
            the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves, they stayed till 
            dusk, and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught 
            a bad cold, that settling obstinately on his lungs, confined him indoors 
            throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission. 
            <p>Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably 
              sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted 
              on her reading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship 
              no longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, 
              with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two 
              or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow 
              her footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable 
              than his. </p>
            <p>On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh 
              watery afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, 
              withered leaves, and the cold, blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark 
              grey streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant 
              rain--I requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I 
              was certain of showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a 
              cloak, and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the 
              bottom of the park; a formal walk which she generally affected if 
              low-spirited--and that she invariably was when Mr Edgar had been 
              worse than ordinary, a thing never known from his confession, but 
              guessed both by her and me, from his increased silence and the melancholy 
              of his countenance. She went sadly on: there was no running or bounding 
              now, though the chill wind might well have tempted her to a race. 
              And often, from the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a 
              hand, and brushing something off her cheek. I gazed round for a 
              means of diverting her thoughts. On one side of the road rose a 
              high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots 
              half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for 
              the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal. In 
              summer, Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and 
              sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and 
              I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still 
              considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an 
              elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. 
              From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing 
              nothing except singing old songs--my nursery lore--to herself, or 
              watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones 
              to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, 
              happier than words can express. </p>
            <p>`Look, miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of 
              one twisted tree. `Winter is not here yet. There's a little flower 
              up yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded 
              those turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, 
              and pluck it to show to papa?' </p>
            <p>Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its 
              earthy shelter, and replied, at length: </p>
            <p>`No, I'll not touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?' 
            </p>
            <p>`Yes,' I observed, `about as starved and sackless as you: your 
              cheeks are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You're 
              so low, I dare say I shall keep up with you. </p>
            <p>`No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing, at intervals, 
              to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus 
              spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, 
              ever and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face. </p>
            <p>`Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and 
              putting my arm over her shoulder. `You mustn't cry because papa 
              has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse. </p>
            <p>She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled 
              by sobs. </p>
            <p>`Oh, it will be something worse,' she said. `And what shall I do 
              when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can't forget your 
              words, Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, 
              how dreary the world will be, when papa and you are dead.' </p>
            <p>`None can tell, whether you won't die before us,' I replied. `It's 
              wrong to anticipate evil. We'll hope there are years and years to 
              come before any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and 
              hardly forty-five. My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to 
              the last. And suppose Mr Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that 
              would be more years than you have counted, miss. And would it not 
              be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?' </p>
            <p>`But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing 
              up with timid hope to seek further consolation. </p>
            <p>`Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied. `She 
              wasn't as happy as master: she hadn't as much to live for. All you 
              need do, is to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting 
              him see you cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: 
              mind that, Cathy! I'll not disguise but you might kill him, if you 
              were wild and reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection 
              for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave; 
              and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation 
              he had judged it expedient to make.' </p>
            <p>`I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered 
              my companion. `I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I'll 
              never--never--oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say 
              a word to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know 
              it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because 
              I would rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves 
              I love him better than myself.' </p>
            <p>`Good words,' I replied. `But deeds must prove it also; and after 
              he is well, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the 
              hour of fear.' </p>
            <p>As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my 
              young lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated 
              herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips 
              that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees, 
              shadowing the highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but 
              only birds could touch the upper, except from Cathy's present station. 
              In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was 
              locked, she proposed scrambling down to recover it. I bid her be 
              cautious lest she got a fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the 
              return was no such easy matter: the stones were smooth and neatly 
              cemented, and the rose-bushes and blackberry stragglers could yield 
              no assistance in re-ascending. I, like a fool, didn't recollect 
              that, till I heard her laughing and exclaiming: </p>
            <p>`Ellen, you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run round 
              to the porter's lodge. I can't scale the ramparts on this side!' 
            </p>
            <p>`Stay where you are,' I answered, `I have my bundle of keys in 
              my pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not I'll go.' </p>
            <p>Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, 
              while I tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the 
              last, and found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that 
              she would remain there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, 
              when an approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; 
              Cathy's dance stopped, and in a minute the horse stopped also. </p>
            <p>`Who is that?' I whispered. </p>
            <p>`Ellen, I wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion 
              anxiously. </p>
            <p>`Ho, Miss Linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), `I'm glad 
              to meet you. Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation 
              to ask and obtain.' </p>
            <p>`I shan't speak to you, Mr Heathcliff,' answered Catherine. `Papa 
              says you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen 
              says the same.' </p>
            <p>`That is nothing to the purpose,' said Heathcliff. (He it was.) 
              `I don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I 
              demand your attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three 
              months since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making 
              love in play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! 
              You especially, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. 
              I've got your letters, and if you give me any pertness I'll send 
              them to your father. I presume you grew weary of the amusement and 
              dropped it, didn't you? Well, you dropped Linton with it into a 
              slough of despond. He was in earnest: in love, really. As true as 
              I live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at your fickleness: 
              not figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made him a standing 
              jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures, and attempted 
              to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily; and he'll 
              be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!' </p>
            <p>`How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?' I called from 
              the inside. `Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such 
              paltry falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: 
              you won't believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself, 
              it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.' 
            </p>
            <p>`I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected 
              villain. `Worthy Mrs Dean, I like you, but I don't like your double-dealing,' 
              he added aloud. `How could you lie so glaringly, as to affirm I 
              hated the ``poor child''? and invent bugbear stories to terrify 
              her from my doorstones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), 
              my bonnie lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if 
              I have not spoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your 
              father in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would 
              value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort 
              you, when your father himself entreated him; and don't, from pure 
              stupidity, fall into the same error. I swear, on my salvation, he's 
              going to his grave, and none but you can save him!' </p>
            <p>The lock gave way and I issued out. </p>
            <p>`I swear Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at 
              me. `And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, 
              if you won't let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall 
              not return till this time next week; and I think your master himself 
              would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin!' </p>
            <p>`Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half-forcing her 
              to re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features 
              of the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit. </p>
            <p>He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed: </p>
            <p>`Miss Catherine, I'll owe to you that I have little patience with 
              Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I'll own that he's with 
              a harsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind 
              word from you would be his best medicine. Don't mind Mrs Dean's 
              cruel cautions; but be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams 
              of you day and night, and cannot be persuaded that you don't hate 
              him, since you neither write nor call.' </p>
            <p>I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock 
              in holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: 
              for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the 
              trees, and warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment 
              on the encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; 
              but I divined instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now 
              in double darkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem 
              hers: she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable 
              true. </p>
            <p>The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to 
              his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, 
              and asked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; 
              and afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, 
              for she was weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon 
              as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her 
              silent weeping: it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. 
              I suffered her to enjoy it a while; then I expostulated: deriding 
              and ridiculing all Mr Heathcliff's assertions about his son, as 
              if I were certain she would coincide. Alas! I hadn't skill to counteract 
              the effect his account had produced: it was just what he intended. 
            </p>
            <p>`You may be right, Ellen,' she answered; `but I shall never feel 
              at ease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that 
              I don't write, and convince him that I shall not change.' </p>
            <p>What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? 
              We parted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road 
              to Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's 
              pony. I couldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale dejected 
              countenance, and heavy eyes; and I yielded, in the faint hope that 
              Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of 
              the tale was founded on fact. </p>

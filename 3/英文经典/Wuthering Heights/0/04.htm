          <td> What vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself 
            independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, 
            at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable--I, 
            weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits 
            and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and, under 
            pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, 
            I desired Mrs Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while 
            I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either 
            rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk. <br>
            `You have lived here a considerable time,' I commenced; `did you not 
            say sixteen years?' 
            <p>`Eighteen, sir: I came, when the mistress was married, to wait 
              on her; after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.' 
            </p>
            <p>`Indeed.' </p>
            <p>There ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about 
              her own affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having 
              studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud 
              of meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated: </p>
            <p>`Ah, times are greatly changed since then!' </p>
            <p>`Yes,' I remarked, `you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?' 
            </p>
            <p>`I have: and troubles too,' she said. </p>
            <p>`Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!' I thought to 
              myself. `A good subject to start--and that pretty girl-widow, I 
              should like to know her history: whether she be a native of the 
              country, or, as is more probable, an exotic that the surly indigenae 
              will not recognize for kin.' With this intention I asked Mrs Dean 
              why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a 
              situation and residence so much inferior. `Is he not rich enough 
              to keep the estate in good order?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>`Rich, sir!' she returned. `He has, nobody knows what money, and 
              every year it increases. Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a 
              finer house than this: but he's very near--close-handed; and, if 
              he had meant to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard 
              of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting 
              a few hundreds more. It is strange people should be so greedy, when 
              they are alone in the world!' </p>
            <p>`He had a son, it seems?' </p>
            <p>`Yes, he had one--he is dead.' </p>
            <p>`And, that young lady, Mrs Heathcliff, is his widow?' </p>
            <p>`Yes. </p>
            <p>`Where did she come from originally?' </p>
            <p>`Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was 
              her maiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr Heathcliff 
              would remove here, and then we might have been together again.' 
            </p>
            <p>`What! Catherine Linton?' I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute's 
              reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. </p>
            <p>`Then,' I continued, `my predecessor's name was Linton?' </p>
            <p>`It was. </p>
            <p>`And who is that Earnshaw, Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr 
              Heathcliff? are they relations?' </p>
            <p>`No; he is the late Mrs Linton's nephew.' </p>
            <p>`The young lady's cousin, then?' </p>
            <p>`Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother's, 
              the other on the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr Linton's sister.' 
            </p>
            <p>`I see the house at Wuthering Heights has &quot;Earnshaw&quot; 
              carved over the front door. Are they an old family?' </p>
            <p>`Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy 
              is of us--I mean of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? 
              I beg pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!' 
            </p>
            <p>`Mrs Heathcliff? She looked very well, and very handsome; yet, 
              I think, not very happy.' </p>
            <p>`Oh dear, I don't wonder! And how did you like the master?' `A 
              rough fellow, rather, Mrs Dean. Is not that his character?' </p>
            <p>`Rough as a saw edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle 
              with him the better.' </p>
            <p>`He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a 
              churl. Do you know anything of his history?' </p>
            <p>`It's a cuckoo's, sir--I know all about it: except where he was 
              born, and who were his parents, and how he got his money, at first. 
              And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate 
              lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he 
              has been cheated.' </p>
            <p>`Well, Mrs Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something 
              of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest, if I go to bed; so be 
              good enough to sit and chat an hour.' </p>
            <p>`Oh, certainly, sir! I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then 
              I'll sit as long as you please. But you've caught cold: I saw you 
              shivering, and you must have some gruel to drive it out.' </p>
            <p>The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my 
              head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, 
              almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. </p>
            <p>This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as 
              I am still) of serious effects from the incidents of today and yesterday. 
              She returned presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of 
              work; and, having placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, 
              evidently pleased to find me so companionable. </p>
            <p>Before I came to live here, she commenced--waiting no further invitation 
              to her story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because 
              my mother had nursed Mr Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, 
              and I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, 
              and helped to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything 
              that anybody would set me to. One fine summer morning--it was the 
              beginning of harvest, I remember--Mr Earnshaw, the old master, came 
              downstairs, dressed for a journey; and after he had told Joseph 
              what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, 
              and me--for I sat eating my porridge with them--and he said, speaking 
              to his son, `Now my bonny man, I'm going to Liverpool today, what 
              shall I bring you? You may choose what you like: only let it be 
              little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, that 
              is a long spell!' Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss 
              Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse 
              in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did not forget me; for he 
              had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes. He promised 
              to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed 
              his children goodbye and set off. </p>
            <p>It seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his absence--and 
              often did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs Earnshaw expected 
              him by supper time on the third evening, and she put the meal off 
              hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and 
              at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. 
              Then it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged 
              sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, 
              the door latch was raised quietly and in stepped the master. He 
              threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them 
              all stand off, for he was nearly killed--he would not have such 
              another walk for the three kingdoms. </p>
            <p>`And at the end of it, to be flighted to death!' he said, opening 
              his greatcoat, which he held bundled up in his arms. `See here, 
              wife! I was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must 
              e'en take it as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if 
              it came from the devil.' </p>
            <p>We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head, I had a peep at a 
              dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: 
              indeed, its face looked older than Catherine's; yet, when it was 
              set on its feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over 
              again some gibberish, that nobody could understand. I was frightened, 
              and Mrs Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly 
              up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the 
              house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for? What 
              he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad? The master tried 
              to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, 
              and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale 
              of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in 
              the streets of Liverpool; where he picked it up and inquired for 
              its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his 
              money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take 
              it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because 
              he was determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the 
              conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr Earnshaw 
              told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with 
              the children. </p>
            <p>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening 
              till peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's 
              pockets for the presents he had promised them. The former was a 
              boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed 
              to morsels in the greatcoat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when 
              she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, 
              showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little 
              thing; earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach 
              her cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with 
              them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it 
              on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. 
              By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr 
              Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. 
              Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, 
              and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of 
              the house. </p>
            <p>This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family. On coming 
              back a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment 
              perpetual) I found they had christened him `Heathcliff': it was 
              the name of a son who died in childhood, and it has served him ever 
              since, both for Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now 
              very thick; but Hindley hated him! and to say the truth I did the 
              same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn't 
              reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the mistress never put 
              in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged. </p>
            <p>He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment: 
              he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, 
              and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, 
              as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame. This 
              endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son 
              persecuting the poor, fatherless child, as he called him. He took 
              to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, 
              he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him 
              up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite. 
            </p>
            <p>So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; 
              and at Mrs Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years 
              after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor 
              rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's 
              affections and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding 
              over these injuries. I sympathized awhile; but when the children 
              fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me 
              the cares of a woman at once, I changed my ideas. Heathcliff was 
              dangerously sick: and while he lay at the worst he would have me 
              constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for 
              him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it. However, 
              I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched 
              over. The difference between him and the others forced me to be 
              less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was 
              as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made 
              him give little trouble. </p>
            <p>He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure 
              owing to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, 
              and softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and 
              thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, 
              and I wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the 
              sullen boy, who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence 
              by any sign of gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, 
              he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had 
              on his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house 
              would be obliged to bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember 
              Mr Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair, and 
              gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon 
              fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley-- </p>
            <p>`You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you 
              won't I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given 
              me this week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.' 
              Hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears. `You'd 
              better do it at once,' he persisted, escaping to the porch (they 
              were in the stable): `you will have to; and if I speak of these 
              blows, you'll get them again with interest.' `Off, dog!' cried Hindley, 
              threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and 
              hay. `Throw it,' he replied, standing still, `and then I'll tell 
              how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he 
              died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly.' Hindley 
              threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered 
              up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I prevented it, 
              he would have gone just so to the master, and got full revenge by 
              letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused it. 
              `Take my colt, gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw. `And I pray that 
              he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper! 
              and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him 
              what you are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he'll kick out 
              your brains!' </p>
            <p>Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own 
              stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech 
              by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine 
              whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. 
              I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself 
              up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and all, 
              and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which 
              the violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house. I persuaded 
              him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: 
              he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted. 
              He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I 
              really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as 
              you will hear. </p>

              <p> 　　The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. 
                The Russian army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk 
                was reached, and again from Smolensk to Borodino. The French army 
                pushed on to Moscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as 
                it neared its aim, just as the velocity of a falling body increases 
                as it approaches the earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles 
                of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles 
                separating it from its goal. Every soldier in Napoleon's army 
                felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.</p>
              <p> 　　The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit 
                of hatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army 
                increased and consolidated. At Borodino a collision took place. 
                Neither army was broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately 
                after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding 
                with another having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability 
                the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled 
                on for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of 
                all its force.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians retreated eighty miles- to beyond Moscow- and 
                the French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For 
                five weeks after that there was not a single battle. The French 
                did not move. As a bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its 
                wounds, they remained inert in Moscow for five weeks, and then 
                suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back: they made a dash for 
                the Kaluga road, and (after a victory- for at Malo-Yaroslavets 
                the field of conflict again remained theirs) without undertaking 
                a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back to 
                Smolensk, beyond Smolensk, beyond the Berezina, beyond Vilna, 
                and farther still.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and 
                the whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino 
                was a victory. Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders 
                to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this 
                not to deceive anyone, but because he knew that the enemy was 
                beaten, as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it.</p>
              <p> 　　But all that evening and next day reports came in one after 
                another of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and 
                a fresh battle proved physically impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　It was impossible to give battle before information had been 
                collected, the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition 
                replenished, the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to 
                replace those who had been killed, and before the men had had 
                food and sleep. And meanwhile, the very next morning after the 
                battle, the French army advanced of itself upon the Russians, 
                carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly 
                increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance 
                from its aim. Kutuzov's wish was to attack next day, and the whole 
                army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so 
                is not sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, 
                and that possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat 
                a day's march, and then in the same way it was impossible not 
                to retreat another and a third day's march, and at last, on the 
                first of September when the army drew near Moscow- despite the 
                strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks- the force 
                of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow. And the 
                troops retired one more, last, day's march, and abandoned Moscow 
                to the enemy.</p>
              <p> 　　For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and 
                battles are made by generals- as any one of us sitting over a 
                map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things 
                in this or that battle- the questions present themselves: Why 
                did Kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that? Why did he 
                not take up a position before reaching Fili? Why did he not retire 
                at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People 
                accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the inevitable 
                conditions which always limit the activities of any commander 
                in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not all resemble 
                the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at case in our 
                studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number 
                of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and 
                begin our plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is 
                never dealing with the beginning of any event- the position from 
                which we always contemplate it. The commander in chief is always 
                in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can 
                at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring. 
                Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself, and 
                at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping of events 
                the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play 
                of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects, counsels, 
                threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to 
                innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict 
                with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that 
                Kutuzov should have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before 
                reaching Fili, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal 
                to him. But a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, 
                has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. 
                And all these proposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict 
                each other.</p>
              <p> 　　A commander in chief's business, it would seem, is simply 
                to choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events 
                and time do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is 
                suggested to him to cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an 
                adjutant gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to 
                engage the French or retire. An order must be given him at once, 
                that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn 
                to the Kaluga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary 
                general asking where the stores are to be taken, and the chief 
                of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a courier 
                from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does 
                not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander 
                in chief's rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are 
                always not merely one but several such), presents a new project 
                diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kaluga road, and 
                the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to 
                maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked 
                in the distribution of rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants 
                of the district pray to be defended, and an officer sent to inspect 
                the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what 
                was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, 
                and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe the 
                position of the enemy's army differently. People accustomed to 
                misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander 
                in chief's actions describe to us, for instance, the position 
                of the army at Fili and assume that the commander in chief could, 
                on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to abandon 
                Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less than 
                four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that 
                question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most palpably 
                of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on the 
                twenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of 
                the retreat from Borodino to Fili. </p>

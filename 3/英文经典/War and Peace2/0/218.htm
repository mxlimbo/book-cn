              <p> 　　Many historians say that the French did not win the battle 
                of Borodino because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not 
                had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would 
                have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been 
                lost and the face of the world have been changed. To historians 
                who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man- Peter 
                the Great- and that France from a republic became an empire and 
                French armies went to Russia at the will of one man- Napoleon- 
                to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad 
                cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.</p>
              <p> 　　If it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight or not to fight 
                the battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement 
                depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation 
                of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet 
                who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth 
                would have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought 
                such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction 
                Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) 
                when he saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles 
                IX's stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that 
                Russia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the 
                French Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the 
                will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue 
                and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the question 
                of what causes historic events another answer presents itself, 
                namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from 
                on high- depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take 
                part in the events, and that a Napoleon's influence on the course 
                of these events is purely external and fictitious.</p>
              <p> 　　Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the 
                Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX's will, 
                though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result 
                of that order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the 
                slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon's 
                will, though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle 
                and thought it was done because he ordered it; strange as these 
                suppositions appear, yet human dignity- which tells me that each 
                of us is, if not more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon- 
                demands the acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic 
                investigation abundantly confirms it.</p>
              <p> 　　At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed 
                no one. That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not 
                he who killed people.</p>
              <p> 　　The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle 
                of Borodino not because of Napoleon's orders but by their own 
                volition. The whole army- French, Italian, German, Polish, and 
                Dutch- hungry, ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the 
                sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was 
                drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight 
                the Russians, they would have killed him and have proceeded to 
                fight the Russians because it was inevitable.</p>
              <p> 　　When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as 
                compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity 
                about their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried 
                &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; just as they had cried &quot;Vive 
                l'Empereur!&quot; at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing 
                the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would 
                have cried &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; at any nonsense that might 
                be told them. There was nothing left for them to do but cry &quot;Vive 
                l'Empereur!&quot; and go to fight, in order to get food and rest 
                as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of Napoleon's commands 
                that they killed their fellow men.</p>
              <p> 　　And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, 
                for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he 
                did not know what was going on before him. So the way in which 
                these people killed one another was not decided by Napoleon's 
                will but occurred independently of him, in accord with the will 
                of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common 
                action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his 
                will. And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has 
                no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport 
                soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold 
                was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as 
                on former occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being 
                as good as previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that 
                Napoleon's cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.</p>
              <p> 　　The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are 
                even better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. 
                His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, 
                but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only 
                seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino was 
                the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent 
                dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist 
                criticizes them with looks oks importance, when they relate to 
                a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and 
                orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to 
                demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has 
                been won.</p>
              <p> 　　The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz 
                were a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still 
                they were criticized- criticized for their very perfection, for 
                their excessive minuteness.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as 
                representative of authority as well as, and even better than, 
                at other battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the 
                battle; he inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no 
                confusion, did not contradict himself, did not get frightened 
                or run away from the field of battle, but with his great tact 
                and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command, 
                calmly and with dignity. </p>

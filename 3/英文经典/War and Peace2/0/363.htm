              <p> 　　 Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually 
                diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection 
                with the external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, 
                and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation 
                to which we contemplate a man's life.</p>
              <p> 　　So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with 
                the external world is well known, where the time between the action 
                and its examination is great, and where the causes of the action 
                are most accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability 
                and a minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent 
                on external conditions, whose action was performed very recently, 
                and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken, we get the 
                conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　In neither case- however we may change our point of view, 
                however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between 
                the man and the external world, however inaccessible it may be 
                to us, however long or short the period of time, however intelligible 
                or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be- can we ever 
                conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity.</p>
              <p> 　　(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from 
                the influence of the external world, we never get a conception 
                of freedom in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned 
                by what surrounds him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let 
                it fall. My action seems to me free; but asking myself whether 
                I could raise my arm in every direction, I see that I raised it 
                in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that 
                action either from things around me or from the construction of 
                my own body. I chose one out of all the possible directions because 
                in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action to be free it 
                was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To conceive 
                of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is 
                evidently impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the 
                time of the deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. 
                For if I examine an action committed a second ago I must still 
                recognize it as not being free, for it is irrevocably linked to 
                the moment at which it was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift 
                it, but ask myself: could I have abstained from lifting my arm 
                at the moment that has already passed? To convince myself of this 
                I do not lift it the next moment. But I am not now abstaining 
                from doing so at the first moment when I asked the question. Time 
                has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then lifted is 
                no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting, nor 
                is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. 
                The moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, 
                and at that moment I could make only one movement, and whatever 
                movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my 
                arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained 
                from lifting it then. And since I could make only one movement 
                at that single moment of time, it could not have been any other. 
                To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine it in the present, 
                on the boundary between the past and the future- that is, outside 
                time, which is impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes 
                may be increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, 
                that is, an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be 
                the cause of the expression of will in any action, our own or 
                another's, the first demand of reason is the assumption of and 
                search for a cause, for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable. 
                I raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause, 
                but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause 
                of my action.</p>
              <p> 　　But even if- imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, 
                examining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by 
                any cause- we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of 
                inevitability as equaled zero, we should even then not have arrived 
                at the conception of complete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced 
                by the external world, standing outside of time and independent 
                of cause, is no longer a man.</p>
              <p> 　　In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite 
                devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions 
                of space in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be 
                complete, for the number of those conditions is as infinite as 
                the infinity of space. And therefore so long as not all the conditions 
                influencing men are defined, there is no complete inevitability 
                but a certain measure of freedom remains.</p>
              <p> 　　(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the 
                action we are examining and the judgment upon it, that period 
                will be finite, while time is infinite, and so in this respect 
                too there can never be absolute inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any 
                action, we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, 
                and so again we never reach absolute inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum 
                of freedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case- as for 
                instance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot- 
                complete absence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the 
                very conception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon 
                as there is no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception 
                of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability 
                without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception 
                of a man's completely free action.</p>
              <p> 　　And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to 
                the law of inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the 
                knowledge of an infinite number of space relations, an infinitely 
                long period of time, and an infinite series of causes.</p>
              <p> 　　To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law 
                of inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, 
                beyond time, and free from dependence on cause.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first case, if inevitability were possible without 
                freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by 
                the laws of inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without 
                content.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability 
                we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, 
                time, and cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned 
                and unlimited would be nothing, or mere content without form.</p>
              <p> 　　We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which 
                man's whole outlook on the universe is constructed- the incomprehensible 
                essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.</p>
              <p> 　　Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give 
                it visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) 
                Time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable 
                otherwise. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no 
                beginning and can have no end.</p>
              <p> 　　Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is 
                but me, consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time 
                by the fixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious 
                of myself as living, consequently I am outside time. (3) I am 
                beyond cause, for I feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation 
                of my life.</p>
              <p> 　　Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness 
                gives expression to the essence of freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in 
                man's consciousness. Inevitability without content is man's reason 
                in its three forms.</p>
              <p> 　　Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. 
                Freedom is the content. Inevitability is the form.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to 
                one another as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive 
                and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man's 
                life.</p>
              <p> 　　Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually 
                define one another as form and content, no conception of life 
                is possible.</p>
              <p> 　　All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation 
                of free will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the 
                laws of reason.</p>
              <p> 　　All that we know of the external world of nature is only a 
                certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or 
                of the essence of life to the laws of reason.</p>
              <p> 　　The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious 
                of them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, 
                animal force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of 
                life in man and we call that freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in 
                itself but felt by every man, is understood by us only to the 
                extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it 
                is subject (from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight, 
                up to Newton's law), so too the force of free will, incomprehensible 
                in itself but of which everyone is conscious, is intelligible 
                to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which 
                it is subject (from the fact that every man dies, up to the knowledge 
                of the most complex economic and historic laws).</p>
              <p> 　　All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life 
                under the laws of reason.</p>
              <p> 　　Man's free will differs from every other force in that man 
                is directly conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no 
                way differs from any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, 
                or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in 
                that they are differently defined by reason. Just so the force 
                of man's free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces 
                of nature only by the definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart 
                from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of reason that define 
                it, differs in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the force 
                that makes things grow; for reason, it is only a momentary undefinable 
                sensation of life.</p>
              <p> 　　And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly 
                bodies, the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, 
                or of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content 
                of astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, 
                just in the same way does the force of free will form the content 
                of history. But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation 
                of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can 
                only be the subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of 
                the force of free will in human beings in space, in time, and 
                in dependence on cause forms the subject of history, while free 
                will itself is the subject of metaphysics.</p>
              <p> 　　In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws 
                of inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital 
                force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and 
                above what we know of the essence of life.</p>
              <p> 　　So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, 
                what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only 
                an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about 
                the laws of human life. </p>

              <p> 　　&quot;A vos places!&quot;* suddenly cried a voice. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;To your places.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something 
                joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy 
                and the prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and 
                from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, 
                passing the prisoners at a trot. The expression on all faces showed 
                the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority. 
                The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road. 
                The convoy formed up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!&quot; 
                and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn 
                by six gray horses rattled by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man 
                in a three-cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome, 
                plump, white face. It was one of the marshals. His eye fell on 
                Pierre's large and striking figure, and in the expression with 
                which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy 
                and a desire to conceal that sympathy.</p>
              <p> 　　The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage 
                with a red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. 
                Several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round 
                them. Their faces all looked excited and worried.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What did he say? What did he say?&quot; Pierre heard 
                them ask.</p>
              <p> 　　While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together 
                in a crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that 
                morning. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch 
                tree. On his face, besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn 
                yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered 
                innocently, there was now an expression of quiet solemnity.</p>
              <p> 　　Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled 
                with tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say 
                something to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. 
                He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away.</p>
              <p> 　　When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. 
                Karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch 
                tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did 
                not look round again but went limping up the hill.</p>
              <p> 　　From behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came the sound 
                of a shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered 
                that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still 
                remained to Smolensk- a calculation he had begun before the marshal 
                went by. And he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran 
                past Pierre, one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They 
                both looked pale, and in the expression on their faces- one of 
                them glanced timidly at Pierre- there was something resembling 
                what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution. 
                Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days before, 
                that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and 
                how they had laughed at him.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog began 
                to howl. &quot;What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?&quot; thought 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided 
                looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the 
                dog was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look 
                on all their faces.</p>

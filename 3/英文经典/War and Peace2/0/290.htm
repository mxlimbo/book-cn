              <p> 　　Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out 
                of the shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with 
                a little blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, 
                that jumped about him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping 
                beside Karataev at night; it sometimes made excursions into the 
                town but always returned again. Probably it had never had an owner, 
                and it still belonged to nobody and had no name. The French called 
                it Azor; the soldier who told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev 
                and others called it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a 
                master, a name, or even of a breed or any definite color did not 
                seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail 
                stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs served it so 
                well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very 
                easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all 
                four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping 
                with delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, 
                and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the 
                only remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers 
                which by Karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles 
                for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed 
                much during this time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still 
                had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his 
                family. A beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face, 
                and a tangle of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head 
                like a cap. The look of his eyes was resolute, calm, and animatedly 
                alert, as never before. The former slackness which had shown itself 
                even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for 
                action and resistance. His feet were bare.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and 
                horsemen were passing that morning, then into the distance across 
                the river, then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest 
                about biting him, and then at his bare feet which he placed with 
                pleasure in various positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. 
                Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction 
                flitted across his face. The sight of them reminded him of all 
                he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection 
                was pleasant to him.</p>
              <p> 　　For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight 
                frosts in the mornings- what is called an &quot;old wives' summer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly 
                pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost 
                still in the air.</p>
              <p> 　　On everything- far and near- lay the magic crystal glitter 
                seen only at that time autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible 
                in the distance, with the village, the church, and the large white 
                house. The bare trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, 
                the green church spire, and the corners of the white house in 
                the distance, all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate 
                outline and with unnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the 
                familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French, 
                with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence. And 
                even that ruined and befouled house- which in dull weather was 
                repulsively ugly- seemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear, 
                motionless brilliance.</p>
              <p> 　　A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a 
                skullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from 
                behind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly 
                wink.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!&quot; (Their name for 
                Pierre.) &quot;Eh? Just like spring!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre 
                his pipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To be on the march in such weather...&quot; he began.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the 
                corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and 
                there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokolov, 
                one of the soldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre 
                told the corporal that something should be done about him. The 
                corporal replied that Pierre need not worry about that as they 
                had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would 
                be made for the sick, and that in general everything that could 
                happen had been foreseen by the authorities.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word 
                to the captain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. 
                Speak to the captain when he makes his round, he will do anything 
                for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats 
                with Pierre and showed him all sorts of favors.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the other day. 
                'Monsieur Kiril is a man of education, who speaks French. He is 
                a Russian seigneur who <br>
                has had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what's what.... 
                If he wants anything and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When 
                one has studied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.' 
                It is for your sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day 
                if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. 
                (The affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before- 
                a fight between the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which 
                Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners 
                who had heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked 
                what the Frenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he 
                had been told about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered 
                French soldier came up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly 
                raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked 
                Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt 
                to sew was in that shed.</p>
              <p> 　　A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued 
                to them, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up 
                into boots and shirts for them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ready, ready, dear fellow!&quot; said Karataev, coming 
                out with a neatly folded shirt.</p>
              <p> 　　Karataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience 
                at work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black 
                as soot. His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp 
                of lime-tree bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter 
                than ever.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday 
                and here it is, ready,&quot; said Platon, smiling and unfolding 
                the shirt he had sewn.</p>
              <p> 　　The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming 
                his hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. 
                He had a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, 
                thin bare body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners 
                looking on would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt 
                hurriedly. None of the prisoners said a word.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;See, it fits well!&quot; Platon kept repeating, pulling 
                the shirt straight.</p>
              <p> 　　The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without 
                raising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I 
                had no proper tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to 
                kill a louse,&quot; said Platon with one of his round smiles, 
                obviously pleased with his work.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's good, quite good, thank you,&quot; said the Frenchman, 
                in French, &quot;but there must be some linen left over.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It will fit better still when it sets to your body,&quot; 
                said Karataev, still admiring his handiwork. &quot;You'll be nice 
                and comfortable....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?&quot; 
                said the Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation 
                ruble note and gave it to Karataev. &quot;But give me the pieces 
                that are over.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre saw that Platon did not want to understand what the 
                Frenchman was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karataev 
                thanked the Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own 
                work. The Frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that 
                were left over and asked Pierre to translate what he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does he want the bits for?&quot; said Karataev. 
                &quot;They'd make fine leg bands for us. Well, never mind.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, 
                took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it 
                to the Frenchman without looking at him. &quot;Oh dear!&quot; 
                muttered Karataev and went away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, 
                considered for a moment, then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, 
                as if Pierre's look had told him something, suddenly blushed and 
                shouted in a squeaky voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!&quot; And 
                handing back the odd bits he turned and went out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, look at that,&quot; said Karataev, swaying his 
                head. &quot;People said they were not Christians, but they too 
                have souls. It's what the old folk used to say: 'A sweating hand's 
                an open hand, a dry hand's close.' He's naked, but yet he's given 
                it back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking 
                at the pieces.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But they'll make grand leg bands, dear friend,&quot; 
                he said, and went back into the shed. </p>

              <p> 　　On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince 
                Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day 
                and at the very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for 
                the first time. He stopped in the village at the priest's house 
                in front of which stood the commander in chief's carriage, and 
                he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, 
                as everyone now called Kutuzov. From the field beyond the village 
                came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices 
                shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; to the new commander in chief. Two 
                orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten 
                paces from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutuzov's absence 
                and of the fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of 
                hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate 
                and, glancing at Prince Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness 
                was putting up there and whether he would soon be back.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness' 
                staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned 
                to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which 
                a commander in chief's orderly speaks to officers, replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll be here soon. 
                What do you want?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache 
                at the orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch 
                runner, and approached Bolkonski with a slight bow. Bolkonski 
                made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat 
                down beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're also waiting for the commander in chief?&quot; 
                said he. &quot;They say he weceives evewyone, thank God!... It's 
                awful with those sausage eaters! Ermolov had weason to ask to 
                be pwomoted to be a German! Now p'waps Wussians will get a look 
                in. As it was, devil only knows what was happening. We kept wetweating 
                and wetweating. Did you take part in the campaign?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I had the pleasure,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, &quot;not 
                only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat 
                all I held dear- not to mention the estate and home of my birth- 
                my father, who died of grief. I belong to the province of Smolensk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah? You're Pwince Bolkonski? Vewy glad to make your 
                acquaintance! I'm Lieutenant Colonel Denisov, better known as 
                'Vaska,'&quot; said Denisov, pressing Prince Andrew's hand and 
                looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention. &quot;Yes, 
                I heard,&quot; said he sympathetically, and after a short pause 
                added: &quot;Yes, it's Scythian warfare. It's all vewy well- only 
                not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince Andwew 
                Bolkonski?&quot; He swayed his head. &quot;Vewy pleased, Pwince, 
                to make your acquaintance!&quot; he repeated again, smiling sadly, 
                and he again pressed Prince Andrew's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him 
                of her first suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly 
                back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, 
                but which still found place in his soul. Of late he had received 
                so many new and very serious impressions- such as the retreat 
                from Smolensk, his visit to Bald Hills, and the recent news of 
                his father's death- and had experienced so many emotions, that 
                for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind, 
                and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their 
                former strength. For Denisov, too, the memories awakened by the 
                name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after 
                supper and after Natasha's singing he had proposed to a little 
                girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing. He smiled 
                at the recollection of that time and of his love for Natasha, 
                and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and 
                exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had devised while 
                serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had proposed that 
                plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kutuzov. 
                The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation 
                was to extended, and it proposed that instead of, or concurrently 
                with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French, we 
                should attack their line of communication. He began explaining 
                his plan to Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They can't hold all that line. It's impossible. I will 
                undertake to bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will 
                bweak the line, that's certain! There's only one way- guewilla 
                warfare!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan 
                to Bolkonski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard 
                from the army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling 
                with music and songs and coming from the field where the review 
                was held. Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's coming! He's coming!&quot; shouted a Cossack standing 
                at the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate, at which a knot of 
                soldiers (a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov 
                coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. 
                A huge suite of generals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost 
                beside him, and a crowd of officers ran after and around them 
                shouting, &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutuzov was 
                impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his 
                weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap 
                with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When 
                he came up to the guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly 
                wearing decorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked 
                at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the 
                steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals 
                and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle 
                expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, 
                good-by, General,&quot; he added, and rode into the yard past 
                Prince Andrew and Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&quot; shouted those behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still 
                more corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the 
                scar, and the familiar weariness of his expression were still 
                the same. He was wearing the white Horse Guard's cap and a military 
                overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. 
                He sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whew... whew... whew!&quot; he whistled just audibly 
                as he rode into the yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed 
                strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony. He drew 
                his left foot out of the stirrup and, lurching with his whole 
                body and puckering his face with the effort, raised it with difficulty 
                onto the saddle, leaned on his knee, groaned, and slipped down 
                into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to 
                assist him.</p>
              <p> 　　He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his 
                eyes, glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing 
                him, moved with his waddling gait to the porch. &quot;Whew... 
                whew... whew!&quot; he whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. 
                As often occurs with old men, it was only after some seconds that 
                the impression produced by Prince Andrew's face linked itself 
                up with Kutuzov's remembrance of his personality.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my 
                dear boy? Come along...&quot; said he, glancing wearily round, 
                and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight.</p>
              <p> 　　He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how's your father?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I received news of his death, yesterday,&quot; replied 
                Prince Andrew abruptly.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and 
                then took off his cap and crossed himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's will be done 
                to us all!&quot; He sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and 
                was silent for a while. &quot;I loved him and respected him, and 
                sympathize with you with all my heart.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, 
                and for some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince 
                Andrew saw that Kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling and that 
                tears were in his eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with 
                both hands to raise himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come! Come with me, we'll have a talk,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors 
                than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the 
                porch, despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to 
                stop him. Kutuzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced 
                at him glumly. Denisov, having given his name, announced that 
                he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great 
                importance for their country's welfare. Kutuzov looked wearily 
                at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded 
                them across his stomach, repeating the words: &quot;For our country's 
                welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!&quot; Denisov blushed like a 
                girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, 
                time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting 
                the enemy's lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma. 
                Denisov came from those parts and knew the country well. His plan 
                seemed decidedly a good one, especially from the strength of conviction 
                with which he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally 
                glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something 
                unpleasant to emerge from it. And from that hut, while Denisov 
                was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm really 
                did appear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot; said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denisov's 
                explanations, &quot;are you ready so soon?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ready, your Serene Highness,&quot; replied the general.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: &quot;How is one 
                man to deal with it all?&quot; and again listened to Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,&quot; 
                said Denisov, &quot;that I can bweak Napoleon's line of communication!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich 
                Denisov?&quot; asked Kutuzov, interrupting him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, we were friends,&quot; said Kutuzov cheerfully. 
                &quot;All right, all right, friend, stay here at the staff and 
                tomorrow we'll have a talk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand 
                for the papers Konovnitsyn had brought him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?&quot; 
                said the general on duty in a discontented voice, &quot;the plans 
                must be examined and several papers have to be signed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in 
                readiness within. But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter 
                that room till he was disengaged. He made a grimace...</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear 
                boy. I'll look at them here,&quot; said he. &quot;Don't go away,&quot; 
                he added, turning to Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch 
                and listened to the general's report.</p>
              <p> 　　While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper 
                of a woman's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. 
                Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door 
                a plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk 
                kerchief on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the 
                entrance of the commander in chief. Kutiizov's adjutant whispered 
                to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home 
                it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread 
                and salt. &quot;Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with 
                the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the 
                house.... She's very pretty,&quot; added the adjutant with a smile. 
                At those words Kutuzov looked round. He was listening to the general's 
                report- which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position 
                at Tsarevo-Zaymishche- as he had listened to Denisov, and seven 
                years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz 
                council of war. He evidently listened only because he had ears 
                which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them, could not 
                help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could 
                say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that 
                would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had 
                to, as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. 
                All that Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the 
                general was saying was even more clever and to the point, but 
                it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, 
                and knew of something else that would decide the matter- something 
                independent of clever. ness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched 
                the commander in chief's face attentively, and the only expression 
                he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning 
                of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe 
                propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and 
                learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but 
                despised them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge- 
                he did not try to display any of these- but because of something 
                else. He despised them because of his old age and experience of 
                life. The only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during 
                that report referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the 
                end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper 
                relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green 
                oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions 
                for compensation.</p>
              <p> 　　After hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips together 
                and shook his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you 
                once for all, my dear fellow,&quot; said he, &quot;into the fire 
                with all such things! Let them cut the crops and burn wood to 
                their hearts' content. I don't order it or allow it, but I don't 
                exact compensation either. One can't get on without it. 'When 
                wood is chopped the chips will fly.'&quot; He looked at the paper 
                again. &quot;Oh, this German precision!&quot; he muttered, shaking 
                his head. </p>

              <p> 　　Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in 
                the ambulance station on the field of Borodino. His feverish state 
                and the inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in 
                the doctor's opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh 
                day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the 
                doctor noticed that his temperature was lower. He had regained 
                consciousness that morning. The first night after they left Moscow 
                had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche, but at 
                Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given 
                some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made 
                him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been 
                placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with 
                closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: &quot;And 
                the tea?&quot; His remembering such a small detail of everyday 
                life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's pulse, and 
                to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He 
                was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient 
                did not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. 
                Timokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew's regiment, had 
                joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having 
                been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They were accompanied 
                by a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his coach. man, and two orderlies.</p>
              <p> 　　They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking 
                with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to 
                understand and remember something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't want any more. Is Timokhin here?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Timokhin crept along the bench to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am here, your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How's your wound?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Couldn't one get a book?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What book?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Gospels. I haven't one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask 
                how he was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly 
                but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under 
                him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and 
                valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry 
                faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from 
                the wound, began examining that dreadful place. The doctor was 
                very much displeased about something and made a change in the 
                dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again 
                and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking 
                them to get him the book and put it under him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What trouble would it be to you?&quot; he said. &quot;I 
                have not got one. Please get it for me and put it under for a 
                moment,&quot; he pleaded in a piteous voice.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You fellows have no conscience,&quot; said he to the 
                valet who was pouring water over his hands. &quot;For just one 
                moment I didn't look after you... It's such pain, you know, that 
                I wonder how he can bear it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something 
                under him!&quot; said the valet.</p>
              <p> 　　The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what 
                was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was 
                when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had 
                stopped at Mytishchi. After growing confused from pain while being 
                carried into the hut he again regained consciousness, and while 
                drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him, 
                and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station 
                when, at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked, those 
                new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness. And 
                those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again possessed 
                his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of happiness 
                and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels. 
                That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position 
                in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his 
                thoughts, and when he came to himself a third time it was in the 
                complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. 
                A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting 
                and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on 
                the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head 
                of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which 
                was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.</p>
              <p> 　　His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually 
                thinks of, feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, 
                but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts 
                or events on which to fix his whole attention. A healthy man can 
                tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil 
                word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his 
                own thoughts. But Prince Andrew's mind was not in a normal state 
                in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active and 
                clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most diverse 
                thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his 
                brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth 
                it had never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the 
                midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he 
                had not the strength to turn it back again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man 
                cannot be deprived,&quot; he thought as he lay in the semi-darkness 
                of the quiet hut, gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide 
                open eyes. &quot;A happiness lying beyond material forces, outside 
                the material influences that act on man- a happiness of the soul 
                alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can understand it, but 
                to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God. But how 
                did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and 
                Prince Andrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion 
                or reality) a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically 
                repeating &quot;piti-piti-piti,&quot; and then &quot;titi,&quot; 
                and then again &quot;piti-piti-piti,&quot; and &quot;ti-ti&quot; 
                once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above 
                the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected 
                out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered 
                music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was 
                difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but 
                nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the 
                sound of whispered rhythmic music- &quot;it stretches, stretches, 
                spreading out and stretching,&quot; said Prince Andrew to himself. 
                While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of 
                this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, 
                he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard 
                the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that 
                flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched 
                his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise 
                it did not destroy the structure, though it knocked against the 
                very region of his face where it was rising. But besides this 
                there was something else of importance. It was something white 
                by the door- the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But perhaps that's my shirt on the table,&quot; he thought, 
                &quot;and that's my legs, and that is the door, but why is it 
                always stretching and drawing itself out, and 'piti-piti-piti' 
                and 'ti-ti' and 'piti-piti-piti'...? That's enough, please leave 
                off!&quot; Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly 
                thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with 
                peculiar clearness and force.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes- love,&quot; he thought again quite clearly. &quot;But 
                not love which loves for something, for some quality, for some 
                purpose, or for some reason, but the love which I- while dying- 
                first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced 
                that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and 
                does not require an object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love 
                one's neighbors, to love one's enemies, to love everything, to 
                love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone 
                dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by 
                divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that 
                I loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When loving with human love one may pass from love to 
                hatred, but divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything 
                else can destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how 
                many people have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved 
                and hated none as I did her.&quot; And he vividly pictured to 
                himself Natasha, not as he had done in the past with nothing but 
                her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time picturing 
                to himself her soul. And he understood her feelings, her sufferings, 
                shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all the 
                cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with 
                her. &quot;If only it were possible for me to see her once more! 
                Just once, looking into those eyes to say...&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!&quot; 
                flopped the fly... And his attention was suddenly carried into 
                another world, a world of reality and delirium in which something 
                particular was happening. In that world some structure was still 
                being erected and did not fall, something was still stretching 
                out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the 
                same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this 
                something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white 
                sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had the 
                pale face and shining eyes of the very Natasha of whom he had 
                just been thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. 
                But the face remained before him with the force of reality and 
                drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished to return that former world 
                of pure thought, but he could not, and delirium drew him back 
                into its domain. The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic 
                murmur, something oppressed him and stretched out, and the strange 
                face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all his strength 
                in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and suddenly 
                there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like 
                a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to 
                himself, Natasha, that same living Natasha whom of all people 
                he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had 
                been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He realized that 
                it was the real living Natasha, and he was not surprised but quietly 
                happy. Natasha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to stir), 
                with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her sobs. 
                Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it something 
                quivered.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You?&quot; he said. &quot;How fortunate!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him 
                on her knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over 
                it and began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forgive me!&quot; she whispered, raising her head and 
                glancing at him. &quot;Forgive me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I love you,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forgive...!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forgive what?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!&quot; faltered Natasha 
                in a scarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand 
                more rapidly, just touching it with her lips.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I love you more, better than before,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew, lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly, 
                compassionately, and with joyous love. Natasha's thin pale face, 
                with its swollen lips, was more than plain- it was dreadful. But 
                Prince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which 
                were beautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.</p>
              <p> 　　Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor. 
                Timokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his 
                leg, had long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering 
                his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's this?&quot; said the doctor, rising from his 
                bed. &quot;Please go away, madam!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed 
                her daughter's absence, knocked at the door.</p>
              <p> 　　Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out 
                of the room and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　From that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs' journey, 
                at every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha 
                never left the wounded Bolkonski, and the doctor had to admit 
                that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness 
                or such skill in nursing a wounded man.</p>
              <p> 　　Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince 
                Andrew die in her daughter's arms during the journey- as, judging 
                by what the doctor said, it seemed might easily happen- she could 
                not oppose Natasha. Though with the intimacy now established between 
                the wounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he 
                recover their former engagement would be renewed, no one- least 
                of all Natasha and Prince Andrew- spoke of this: the unsettled 
                question of life and death, which hung not only over Bolkonski

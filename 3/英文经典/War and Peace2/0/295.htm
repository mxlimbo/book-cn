              <p> 　　It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for 
                four days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles 
                in an hour and a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovitinov 
                reached Litashevka after one o'clock at night. Dismounting at 
                a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, 
                and throwing down his reins, he entered a dark passage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The general on duty, quick! It's very important!&quot; 
                said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark 
                passage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has been very unwell since the evening and this is 
                the third night he has not slept,&quot; said the orderly pleadingly 
                in a whisper. &quot;You should wake the captain first.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But this is very important, from General Dokhturov,&quot; 
                said Bolkhovitinov, entering the open door which he had found 
                by feeling in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor, your honor! A courier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What's that? From whom?&quot; came a sleepy voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich. Napoleon is 
                at Forminsk,&quot; said Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark 
                who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.</p>
              <p> 　　The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't like waking him,&quot; he said, fumbling for 
                something. &quot;He is very ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here is the dispatch,&quot; said Bolkhovitinov. &quot;My 
                orders are to give it at once to the general on duty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You damned rascal, 
                where do you always hide it?&quot; said the voice of the man who 
                was stretching himself, to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, 
                Konovnitsyn's adjutant.) &quot;I've found it, I've found it!&quot; 
                he added.</p>
              <p> 　　The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling 
                for something on the candlestick.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, the nasty beasts!&quot; said he with disgust.</p>
              <p> 　　By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin's 
                youthful face as he held the candle, and the face of another man 
                who was still asleep. This was Konovnitsyn.</p>
              <p> 　　When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder 
                burned up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow 
                candle, from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had 
                been gnawing it were running away, and looked at the messenger. 
                Bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared 
                his face by wiping it with his sleeve.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who gave the report?&quot; inquired Shcherbinin, taking 
                the envelope.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The news is reliable,&quot; said Bolkhovitinov. &quot;Prisoners, 
                Cossacks, and the scouts all say the same thing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's nothing to be done, we'll have to wake him,&quot; 
                said Shcherbinin, rising and going up to the man in the nightcap 
                who lay covered by a greatcoat. &quot;Peter Petrovich!&quot; said 
                he. (Konovnitsyn did not stir.) &quot;To the General Staff!&quot; 
                he said with a smile, knowing that those words would be sure to 
                arouse him.</p>
              <p> 　　And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On 
                Konovnitsyn's handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever, 
                there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression 
                remote from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and 
                his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what is it? From whom?&quot; he asked immediately 
                but without hurry, blinking at the light.</p>
              <p> 　　While listening to the officer's report Konovnitsyn broke 
                the seal and read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he 
                lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor 
                and began putting on his boots. Then he took off his nightcap, 
                combed his hair over his temples, and donned his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was 
                of great importance and that no time must be lost. He did not 
                consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad. That 
                did not interest him. He regarded the whole business of the war 
                not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else. 
                There was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would 
                be well, but that one must not trust to this and still less speak 
                about it, but must only attend to one's own work. And he did his 
                work, giving his whole strength to the task.</p>
              <p> 　　Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to have 
                been included merely for propriety's sake in the list of the so-called 
                heroes of 1812- the Barclays, Raevskis, Ermolovs, Platovs, and 
                Miloradoviches. Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being 
                a man of very limited capacity and information, and like Dokhturov 
                he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation 
                was most difficult. Since his appointment as general on duty he 
                had always slept with his door open, giving orders that every 
                messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In battle he was always 
                under fire, so that Kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to 
                send him to the front, and like Dokhturov he was one of those 
                unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute 
                the most essential part of the machine.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn 
                frowned- partly from an increased pain in his head and partly 
                at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that 
                nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this 
                news, especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at 
                daggers drawn with Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, 
                quarrel, issue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition 
                was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped.</p>
              <p> 　　And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, 
                immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his 
                quarters, until Konovnitsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded 
                him that they must go to see his Highness. </p>

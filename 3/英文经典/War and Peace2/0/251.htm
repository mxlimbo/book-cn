              <p> 　　Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly 
                anyone in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only 
                here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs 
                could be heard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps 
                were rarely heard. The Povarskaya was quite still and deserted. 
                The huge courtyard of the Rostovs' house was littered with wisps 
                of hay and with dung from the horses, and not a soul was to be 
                seen there. In the great drawing room of the house, which had 
                been left with all it contained, were two people. They were the 
                yard porter Ignat, and the page boy Mishka, Vasilich's grandson 
                who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather. Mishka had opened 
                the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger. The yard 
                porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with satisfaction before 
                the large mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Isn't it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?&quot; said the boy, 
                suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only fancy!&quot; answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening 
                grin on his face in the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impudence! Impudence!&quot; they heard behind them the 
                voice of Mavra Kuzminichna who had entered silently. &quot;How 
                he's grinning, the fat mug! Is that what you're here for? Nothing's 
                cleared away down there and Vasilich is worn out. Just you wait 
                a bit!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ignat left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of 
                the room with meekly downcast eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aunt, I did it gently,&quot; said the boy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll give you something gently, you monkey you!&quot; 
                cried Mavra Kuzminichna, raising her arm threateningly. &quot;Go 
                and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mavra Kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and 
                closed it, and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked 
                its main door.</p>
              <p> 　　Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should 
                go next- to drink tea in the servants' wing with Vasilich, or 
                into the storeroom to put away what still lay about.</p>
              <p> 　　She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. 
                Someone stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone 
                tried to open it. Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who do you want?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count- Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And who are you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An officer, I have to see him,&quot; came the reply 
                in a pleasant, well-bred Russian voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Mavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, 
                with the round face of a Rostov, entered the yard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,&quot; 
                said Mavra Kuzminichna cordially.</p>
              <p> 　　The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating 
                whether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, how annoying!&quot; he muttered. &quot;I should 
                have come yesterday.... Ah, what a pity.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile, Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically 
                examining the familiar Rostov features of the young man's face, 
                his tattered coat and trodden-down boots.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What did you want to see the count for?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh well... it can't be helped!&quot; said he in a tone 
                of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.</p>
              <p> 　　He again paused in indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see,&quot; he suddenly said, &quot;I am a kinsman 
                of the count's and he has been very kind to me. As you see&quot; 
                (he glanced with an amused air and good-natured smile at his coat 
                and boots) &quot;my things are worn out and I have no money, so 
                I was going to ask the count...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mavra Kuzminichna did not let him finish.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,&quot; said 
                she.</p>
              <p> 　　And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned 
                and, hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard 
                to the servants' quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　While Mavra Kuzminichna was running to her room the officer 
                walked about the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered 
                head and a faint smile on his lips. &quot;What a pity I've missed 
                Uncle! What a nice old woman! Where has she run off to? And how 
                am I to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment, which must 
                by now be getting near the Rogozhski gate?&quot; thought he. Just 
                then Mavra Kuzminichna appeared from behind the corner of the 
                house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a rolled-up 
                check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from the officer 
                she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble 
                assignat and hastily handed it to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he 
                would of course... but as it is...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mavra Kuzminichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did 
                not decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If the count had been at home...&quot; Mavra Kuzminichna 
                went on apologetically. &quot;Christ be with you, sir! May God 
                preserve you!&quot; said she, bowing as she saw him out.</p>
              <p> 　　Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the 
                officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward 
                the Yauza bridge to overtake his regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　But Mavra Kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time 
                with moist eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected 
                flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.

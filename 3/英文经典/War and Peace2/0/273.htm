              <p> 　　On the eighth of September an officer- a very important one 
                judging by the respect the guards showed him- entered the coach 
                house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone 
                on the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over 
                all the Russians there, naming Pierre as &quot;the man who does 
                not give his name.&quot; Glancing indolently and indifferently 
                at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge to have 
                them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the 
                marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre 
                with thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field. It was a fine 
                day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke 
                did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from 
                the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure 
                air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose 
                on all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one 
                vast charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only 
                stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the 
                blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins 
                and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and there 
                he could see churches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which 
                was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers 
                and the belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent 
                of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly 
                clearly. These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the 
                feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no 
                one to celebrate this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, 
                and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people 
                who tried to hide when they saw the French.</p>
              <p> 　　It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, 
                but in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, 
                Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French 
                order had been established over this ruined nest. He felt this 
                in the looks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly 
                and gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt 
                it in the looks of an important French official in a carriage 
                and pair driven by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt 
                it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left 
                side of the field, and felt and realized it especially from the 
                list of prisoners the French officer had read out when he came 
                that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and 
                led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other 
                men, and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused 
                him with the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned 
                had come back to him in his designation as &quot;the man who does 
                not give his name,&quot; and under that appellation, which to 
                Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading him somewhere with 
                unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other 
                prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were 
                being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be an 
                insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose 
                action he did not understand but which was working well.</p>
              <p> 　　He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of 
                the Virgin's Field, to a large white house with an immense garden 
                not far from the convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov's house, 
                where Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned 
                from the talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, 
                the Duke of Eckmuhl (Davout).</p>
              <p> 　　They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one 
                by one. Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through 
                a glass gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar 
                to him, into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further 
                end of the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently 
                consulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without 
                raising his eyes, he said in a low voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. 
                To him Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious 
                for his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern 
                schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre 
                felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but 
                he did not know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what 
                he had said at his first examination, yet to disclose his rank 
                and position was dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. 
                But before he had decided what to do, Davout raised his head, 
                pushed his spectacles back on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, 
                and looked intently at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know that man,&quot; he said in a cold, measured tone, 
                evidently calculated to frighten Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The chill that had been running down Pierre's back now seized 
                his head as in a vise.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a Russian spy,&quot; Davout interrupted, addressing 
                another general who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.</p>
              <p> 　　Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his 
                voice Pierre rapidly began:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, monseigneur,&quot; he said, suddenly remembering 
                that Davout was a duke. &quot;No, monseigneur, you cannot have 
                known me. I am a militia officer and have not quitted Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your name?&quot; asked Davout.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bezukhov.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What proof have I that you are not lying?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended 
                but in a pleading voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds 
                they looked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart 
                from conditions of war and law, that look established human relations 
                between the two men. At that moment an immense number of things 
                passed dimly through both their minds, and they realized that 
                they were both children of humanity and were brothers.</p>
              <p> 　　At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head 
                from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by 
                numbers, Pierre was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have 
                shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but 
                now he saw in him a human being. He reflected for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can you show me that you are telling the truth?&quot; 
                said Davout coldly.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment 
                and the street where the house was.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are not what you say,&quot; returned Davout.</p>
              <p> 　　In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs 
                of the truth of his statements.</p>
              <p> 　　But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something 
                to Davout.</p>
              <p> 　　Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and 
                began buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked 
                his head in Pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to 
                be led away. But where they were to take him Pierre did not know: 
                back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions 
                had pointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin's Field.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another 
                question to Davout.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; replied Davout, but what this 
                &quot;yes&quot; meant, Pierre did not know.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether 
                it was far, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, 
                he was stupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving 
                his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped 
                too. The only thought in his mind at that time was: who was it 
                that had really sentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission 
                that had first examined him- not one of them wished to or, evidently, 
                could have done it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in 
                so human a way. In another moment Davout would have realized that 
                he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had come in and 
                interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil 
                intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who 
                was executing him, killing him, depriving him of life- him, Pierre, 
                with all his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was 
                doing this? And Pierre felt that it was no one.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a system- a concurrence of circumstances.</p>
              <p> 　　A system of some sort was killing him- Pierre- depriving him 
                of life, of everything, annihilating him.</p>

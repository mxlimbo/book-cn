              <p> 　　If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity 
                to the attainment of certain ends- the greatness of Russia or 
                of France, the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the 
                ideas of the Revolution general progress or anything else- then 
                it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing 
                the conceptions of chance and genius.</p>
              <p> 　　If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth 
                century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might 
                have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without 
                the invasion. If the aim wag the aggrandizement of France, that 
                might have been attained without the Revolution and without the 
                Empire. If the aim was the dissemination of ideas, the printing 
                press could have accomplished that much better than warfare. If 
                the aim was the progress of civilization, it is easy to see that 
                there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient 
                than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.</p>
              <p> 　　Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?</p>
              <p> 　　Because it happened so! &quot;Chance created the situation; 
                genius utilized it,&quot; says history.</p>
              <p> 　　But what is chance? What is genius?</p>
              <p> 　　The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing 
                thing and therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote 
                a certain stage of understanding of phenomena. I do not know why 
                a certain event occurs; I think that I cannot know it; so I do 
                not try to know it and I talk about chance. I see a force producing 
                effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies; I do not 
                understand why this occurs and I talk of genius.</p>
              <p> 　　To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening 
                into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat 
                as the others must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an 
                astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary 
                chances that this ram, who instead of getting into the general 
                fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are 
                oats- that this very ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat.</p>
              <p> 　　But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens 
                to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; 
                they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes 
                beyond their ken, and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence 
                in what happened to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do 
                not know for what purpose they are fattened, they will at least 
                know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally, 
                and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately 
                intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond 
                our ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives 
                of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they 
                produce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and 
                then the words chance and genius become superfluous.</p>
              <p> 　　We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the 
                European convulsions and that we know only the facts- that is, 
                the murders, first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, 
                in Austria, in Spain, and in Russia- and that the movements from 
                the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence 
                and purpose of these events, and not only shall we have no need 
                to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, 
                but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like 
                other men, and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance 
                for an explanation of those small events which made these people 
                what they were, but it will be clear that all those small events 
                were inevitable.</p>
              <p> 　　By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, 
                we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom 
                or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it 
                produces, so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely 
                adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to 
                fulfill, than Napoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents.

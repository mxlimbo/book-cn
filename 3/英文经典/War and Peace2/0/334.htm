              <p> 　　Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; 
                a few minutes later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered 
                with Natasha. Natasha was calm, though a severe and grave expression 
                had again settled on her face. They all three of them now experienced 
                that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious 
                and heartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same conversation, 
                to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to speak is 
                there and silence seems like affectation. They went silently to 
                table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again. 
                Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break 
                the silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess Mary. They had 
                evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone 
                with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also 
                has joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you take vodka, Count?&quot; asked Princess Mary, 
                and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past. &quot;Now 
                tell us about yourself,&quot; said she. &quot;One hears such improbable 
                wonders about you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony 
                now habitual to him. &quot;They even tell me wonders I myself 
                never dreamed of! Mary Abramovna invited me to her house and kept 
                telling me what had happened, or ought to have happened, to me. 
                Stepan Stepanych also instructed me how I ought to tell of my 
                experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very easy to 
                be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people invite 
                me out and tell me all about myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have been told,&quot; Princess Mary interrupted her, 
                &quot;that you lost two millions in Moscow. Is that true?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I am three times as rich as before,&quot; returned 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay 
                his wife's debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained 
                that he had become three times as rich as before.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What I have certainly gained is freedom,&quot; he began 
                seriously, but did not continue, noticing that this theme was 
                too egotistic.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And are you building?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes. Savelich says I must!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when 
                you decided to remain in Moscow?&quot; asked Princess Mary and 
                immediately blushed, noticing that her question, following his 
                mention of freedom, ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps 
                not intended.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; answered Pierre, evidently not considering 
                awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his words. &quot;I 
                heard of it in Orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me. 
                We were not an exemplary couple,&quot; he added quickly, glancing 
                at Natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would 
                speak of his wife, &quot;but her death shocked me terribly. When 
                two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one's own 
                guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer 
                alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation! 
                I am very, very sorry for her,&quot; he concluded, and was pleased 
                to notice a look of glad approval on Natasha's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,&quot; 
                said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried 
                not to look at Natasha. When he ventured to glance her way again 
                her face was cold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we 
                have been told?&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being 
                taken prisoner means being Napoleon's guest. Not only did I never 
                see him but I heard nothing about him- I was in much lower company!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak 
                about his captivity was gradually led on to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?&quot; 
                Natasha asked with a slight smile. &quot;I guessed it then when 
                we met at the Sukharev tower, do you remember?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually 
                led by Princess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into 
                giving a detailed account of his adventures.</p>
              <p> 　　At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary 
                with him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when 
                he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed 
                he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the 
                suppressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong 
                impressions he has lived through.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and 
                now at Natasha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and 
                his goodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of 
                her face constantly changing with the narrative, watched Pierre 
                with an attention that never wandered- evidently herself experiencing 
                all that he described. Not only her look, but her exclamations 
                and the brief questions she put, showed Pierre that she understood 
                just what he wished to convey. It was clear that she understood 
                not only what he said but also what he wished to, but could not, 
                express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident with 
                the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was 
                this: &quot;It was an awful sight- children abandoned, some in 
                the flames... One was snatched out before my eyes... and there 
                were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings 
                torn out...&quot; he flushed and grew confused. &quot;Then a patrol 
                arrived and all the men- all those who were not looting, that 
                is- were arrested, and I among them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sure you're not telling us everything; I am sure 
                you did something...&quot; said Natasha and pausing added, &quot;something 
                fine?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted 
                to pass over the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he 
                should not omit anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this time 
                he had risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natasha following 
                him with her eyes. Then he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, you can't understand what I learned from that illiterate 
                man- that simple fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, go on!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Where is 
                he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They killed him almost before my eyes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell 
                of the last days of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his 
                death.</p>
              <p> 　　He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. 
                He now, as it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. 
                Now that he was telling it all to Natasha he experienced that 
                pleasure which a man has when women listen to him- not clever 
                women who when listening either try to remember what they hear 
                to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it, 
                or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly 
                contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little 
                mental workshop- but the pleasure given by real women gifted with 
                a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself. 
                Natasha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose 
                a word, no single quiver in Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch 
                of a muscle in his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the 
                unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open 
                heart, divining the secret meaning of all Pierre's mental travail.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, 
                but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. 
                She saw the possibility of love and happiness between Natasha 
                and Pierre, and the first thought of this filled her heart with 
                gladness.</p>
              <p> 　　It was three o'clock in the morning. The footmen came in with 
                sad and stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at him 
                intently with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying 
                to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold. 
                Pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally 
                at her, and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh 
                subject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred to none of them 
                that it was three o'clock and time to go to bed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,&quot; remarked 
                Pierre, &quot;but if at this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather 
                be what you were before you were taken prisoner, or go through 
                all this again?' then for heaven's sake let me again have captivity 
                and horseflesh! We imagine that when we are thrown out of our 
                usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that what is new and 
                good begins. While there is life there is happiness. There is 
                much, much before us. I say this to you,&quot; he added, turning 
                to Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; she said, answering something quite 
                different. &quot;I too should wish nothing but to relive it all 
                from the beginning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked intently at her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and nothing more.&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not true, not true!&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;I 
                am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live- nor you either.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly Natasha bent her head, covered her face with her 
                hands, and began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it, Natasha?&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; She smiled at Pierre through 
                her tears. &quot;Good night! It is time for bed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre rose and took his leave. </p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom. They 
                talked of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express 
                her opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, good night, Mary!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Do 
                you know, I am often afraid that by not speaking of him&quot; 
                (she meant Prince Andrew) &quot;for fear of not doing justice 
                to our feelings, we forget him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice 
                of Natasha's remark, but she did not express agreement in words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it possible to forget?&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It 
                was hard and painful, but good, very good!&quot; said Natasha. 
                &quot;I am sure he really loved him. That is why I told him... 
                Was it all right?&quot; she added, suddenly blushing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!&quot; 
                said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, Mary...&quot; Natasha suddenly said with 
                a mischievous smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her 
                face for a long time, &quot;he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, 
                and fresh- as if he had just come out of a Russian bath; do you 
                understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn't it true?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Princess Mary. &quot;He has greatly 
                improved.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, 
                well, just as if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used 
                to...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I understand why he&quot; (Prince Andrew) &quot;liked 
                no one so much as him,&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are 
                friends when they are quite different. That must be true. Really 
                he is quite unlike him- in everything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but he's wonderful.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, good night,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on 
                her face as if it had been forgotten there.</p>

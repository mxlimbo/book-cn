              <p> 　　Natasha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only 
                a husband and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness 
                and rapidity, understanding and expressing each other's thoughts 
                in ways contrary to all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, 
                or conclusions, and in a quite peculiar way. Natasha was so used 
                to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the 
                surest sign of something being wrong between them if Pierre followed 
                a line of logical reasoning. When he began proving anything, or 
                talking argumentatively and calmly and she, led on by his example, 
                began to do the same, she knew that they were on the verge of 
                a quarrel.</p>
              <p> 　　From the moment they were alone and Natasha came up to him 
                with wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed 
                it to her bosom, saying: &quot;Now you are all mine, mine! You 
                won't escape!&quot;- from that moment this conversation began, 
                contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because 
                quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same 
                time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent 
                a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign 
                that they fully understood one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and 
                contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in 
                this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves 
                were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha spoke to Pierre about her brother's life and doings, 
                of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, 
                and of how she was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was 
                in every way better than herself. In saying this Natasha was sincere 
                in acknowledging Mary's superiority, but at the same time by saying 
                it she made a demand on Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer 
                her to Mary and to all other women, and that now, especially after 
                having seen many women in Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, answering Natasha's words, told her how intolerable 
                it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,&quot; 
                he said. &quot;It was simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked intently at him and went on:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary is so splendid,&quot; she said. &quot;How she understands 
                children! It is as if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, 
                for instance, Mitya was naughty...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How like his father he is,&quot; Pierre interjected.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's likeness to Nicholas: 
                the recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant 
                and he wanted to know what Natasha thought of it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything 
                not generally accepted. But I understand that you value what opens 
                up a fresh line,&quot; said she, repeating words Pierre had once 
                uttered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions 
                are an amusement- almost a pastime,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;For 
                instance, he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not 
                to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought- 
                Sismondi and Rousseau and Montesquieu,&quot; he added with a smile. 
                &quot;You know how much I...&quot; he began to soften down what 
                he had said; but Natasha interrupted him to show that this was 
                unnecessary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you say ideas are an amusement to him....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time 
                in Petersburg I saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up 
                by a thought, all else is mere amusement.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you met the children,&quot; 
                said Natasha. &quot;Which was most delighted? Lisa, I'm sure.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; Pierre replied, and went on with what was 
                in his mind. &quot;Nicholas says we ought not to think. But I 
                can't help it. Besides, when I was in Petersburg I felt (I can 
                this to you) that the whole affair would go to pieces without 
                me- everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded in uniting 
                them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see, I 
                don't say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken. 
                What I say is: 'Join hands, you who love the right, and let there 
                be but one banner- that of active virtue.' Prince Sergey is a 
                fine fellow and clever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre's 
                idea, but one thing disconcerted her. &quot;Can a man so important 
                and necessary to society be also my husband? How did this happen?&quot; 
                She wished to express this doubt to him. &quot;Now who could decide 
                whether he is really cleverer than all the others?&quot; she asked 
                herself, and passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected. 
                Judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected 
                so highly as Platon Karataev.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know what I am thinking about?&quot; she asked. 
                &quot;About Platon Karataev. Would he have approved of you now, 
                do you think?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood 
                his wife's line of thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Platon Karataev?&quot; he repeated, and pondered, evidently 
                sincerely trying to imagine Karataev's opinion on the subject. 
                &quot;He would not have understood... yet perhaps he would.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I love you awfully!&quot; Natasha suddenly said. &quot;Awfully, 
                awfully!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he would not have approved,&quot; said Pierre, after 
                reflection. &quot;What he would have approved of is our family 
                life. He was always so anxious to find seemliness, happiness, 
                and peace in everything, and I should have been proud to let him 
                see us. There now- you talk of my absence, but you wouldn't believe 
                what a special feeling I have for you after a separation....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I should think...&quot; Natasha began.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's not that. I never leave off loving you. And 
                one couldn't love more, but this is something special.... Yes, 
                of course-&quot; he did not finish because their eyes meeting 
                said the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What nonsense it is,&quot; Natasha suddenly exclaimed, 
                &quot;about honeymoons, and that the greatest happiness is at 
                first! On the contrary, now is the best of all. If only you did 
                not go away! Do you remember how we quarreled? And it was always 
                my fault. Always mine. And what we quarreled about- I don't even 
                remember!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always about the same thing,&quot; said Pierre with 
                a smile. &quot;Jealo...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't say it! I can't bear it!&quot; Natasha cried, 
                and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively. &quot;Did you 
                see her?&quot; she added, after a pause.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, and if I had I shouldn't have recognized her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They were silent for a while.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study 
                I was looking at you,&quot; Natasha began, evidently anxious to 
                disperse the cloud that had come over them. &quot;You are as like 
                him as two peas- like the boy.&quot; (She meant her little son.) 
                &quot;Oh, it's time to go to him.... The milk's come.... But I'm 
                sorry to leave you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning 
                to one another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre 
                began with self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha with a quiet, 
                happy smile. Having interrupted one another they both stopped 
                to let the other continue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No. What did you say? Go on, go on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his 
                complacent reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment 
                it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to 
                the whole of Russian society and to the whole world.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I only wished to say that ideas that have great results 
                are always simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people 
                are united and constitute a power, then honest folk must do the 
                same. Now that's simple enough.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what were you going to say?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? Only nonsense.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But all the same?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh nothing, only a trifle,&quot; said Natasha, smilingly 
                still more brightly. &quot;I only wanted to tell you about Petya: 
                today nurse was coming to take him from me, and he laughed, shut 
                his eyes, and clung to me. I'm sure he thought he was hiding. 
                Awfully sweet! There, now he's crying. Well, good-by!&quot; and 
                she left the room. </p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski's bedroom 
                a little lamp was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the 
                dark and they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped 
                up on four pillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic 
                snoring. Little Nicholas, who had just waked up in a cold perspiration, 
                sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes. He had 
                awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed that he and Uncle 
                Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch, 
                were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white slanting 
                lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in 
                autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vierge. In front 
                was Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. 
                He and Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and 
                nearer to their goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began 
                to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move. 
                And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening 
                attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you done this?&quot; he said, pointing to some 
                broken sealing wax and pens. &quot;I loved you, but I have orders 
                from Arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves forward.&quot; 
                Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but Pierre was no longer 
                there. In his place was his father- Prince Andrew- and his father 
                had neither shape nor form, but he existed, and when little Nicholas 
                perceived him he grew faint with love: he felt himself powerless, 
                limp, and formless. His father caressed and pitied him. But Uncle 
                Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror seized young Nicholas 
                and he awoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My father!&quot; he thought. (Though there were two 
                good portraits of Prince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined 
                him in human form.) &quot;My father has been with me and caressed 
                me. He approved of me and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell 
                me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should 
                not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know they want me to 
                learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have finished learning, 
                and then I will do something. I only pray God that something may 
                happen to me such as happened to Plutarch's men, and I will act 
                as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me, 
                and be delighted with me!&quot; And suddenly his bosom heaved 
                with sobs and he began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you ill?&quot; he heard Dessalles' voice asking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is good and kind and I am fond of him!&quot; he thought 
                of Dessalles. &quot;But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man 
                he is! And my father? Oh, Father, Father! Yes, I will do something 
                with which even he would be satisfied....&quot; </p>

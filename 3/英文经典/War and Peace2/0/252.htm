              <p> 　　From an unfinished house on the Varvarka, the ground floor 
                of which was a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches 
                round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. 
                Tipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they 
                were all laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing 
                discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not 
                because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they 
                were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean 
                blue coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine 
                straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his 
                thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. 
                Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were 
                singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads 
                his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally 
                to spread out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping 
                down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left 
                hand, as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he 
                was flourishing should be bare. In the midst of the song cries 
                were heard, and fighting and blows in the passage and porch. The 
                tall lad waved his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop it!&quot; he exclaimed peremptorily. &quot;There's 
                a fight, lads!&quot; And, still rolling up his sleeve, he went 
                out to the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership 
                of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had 
                brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this 
                had had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring 
                smithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing 
                it to have been broken into, wished to force their way in too 
                and a fight in the porch had resulted.</p>
              <p> 　　The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and 
                when the workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from 
                the tavern keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.</p>
              <p> 　　Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against 
                the publican with his chest.</p>
              <p> 　　The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in 
                the face and cried wildly: &quot;They're fighting us, lads!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his 
                bruised face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: &quot;Police! 
                Murder!... They've killed a man, lads!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death- killed!...&quot; 
                screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by.</p>
              <p> 　　A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Haven't you robbed people enough- taking their last 
                shirts?&quot; said a voice addressing the publican. &quot;What 
                have you killed a man for, you thief?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes 
                from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering 
                whom he ought to fight now.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Murderer!&quot; he shouted suddenly to the publican. 
                &quot;Bind him, lads!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I daresay you would like to bind me!&quot; shouted the 
                publican, pushing away the men advancing on him, and snatching 
                his cap from his head he flung it on the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, 
                the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know the law very well, mates! I'll take the matter 
                to the captain of police. You think I won't get to him? Robbery 
                is not permitted to anybody now a days!&quot; shouted the publican, 
                picking up his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come along then! Come along then!&quot; the publican 
                and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other, and they 
                moved up the street together.</p>
              <p> 　　The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands 
                and others followed behind, talking and shouting.</p>
              <p> 　　At the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a large house with 
                closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker's signboard, stood a score 
                of thin, worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and 
                long tattered coats.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He should pay folks off properly,&quot; a thin workingman, 
                with frowning brows and a straggly beard, was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But he's sucked our blood and now he thinks he's quit 
                of us. He's been misleading us all the week and now that he's 
                brought us to this pass he's made off.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased 
                speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the 
                moving crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are all the folks going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, to the police, of course!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, is it true that we have been beaten?&quot; &quot;And 
                what did you think? Look what folks are saying.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage 
                of the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.</p>
              <p> 　　The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, 
                waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting 
                general attention to himself. It was around him that the people 
                chiefly crowded, expecting answers from him to the questions that 
                occupied all their minds.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He must keep order, keep the law, that's what the government 
                is there for. Am I not right, good Christians?&quot; said the 
                tall youth, with a scarcely perceptible smile. &quot;He thinks 
                there's no government! How can one do without government? Or else 
                there would be plenty who'd rob us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why talk nonsense?&quot; rejoined voices in the crowd. 
                &quot;Will they give up Moscow like this? They told you that for 
                fun, and you believed it! Aren't there plenty of troops on the 
                march? Let him in, indeed! That's what the government is for. 
                You'd better listen to what people are saying,&quot; said some 
                of the mob pointing to the tall youth.</p>
              <p> 　　By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered 
                round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An ukase, they are reading an ukase! Reading an ukase!&quot; 
                cried voices in the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 
                31 When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but 
                at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, 
                he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the 
                beginning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,&quot; 
                he read (&quot;Sirin Highness,&quot; said the tall fellow with 
                a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow), &quot;to 
                consult with him to act, and to aid the army to exterminate these 
                scoundrels. We too will take part...&quot; the reader went on, 
                and then paused (&quot;Do you see,&quot; shouted the youth victoriously, 
                &quot;he's going to clear up the whole affair for you....&quot;), 
                &quot;in destroying them, and will send these visitors to the 
                devil. I will come back to dinner, and we'll set to work. We will 
                do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. 
                The tall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one 
                had understood the last part. In particular, the words &quot;I 
                will come back to dinner,&quot; evidently displeased both reader 
                and audience. The people's minds were tuned to a high pitch and 
                this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible- it was what 
                any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukase 
                emanating from the highest authority should not say.</p>
              <p> 　　They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved 
                his lips and swayed from side to side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We should ask him... that's he himself?&quot;... &quot;Yes, 
                ask him indeed!... Why not? He'll explain&quot;... voices in the 
                rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general 
                attention turned to the police superintendent's trap which drove 
                into the square attended by two mounted dragoons.</p>
              <p> 　　The superintendent of police, who had that morning by Count 
                Rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with 
                that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment 
                in his pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his 
                coachman to stop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What people are these?&quot; he shouted to the men, 
                who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What people are these?&quot; he shouted again, receiving 
                no answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor...&quot; replied the shopman in the frieze 
                coat, &quot;your honor, in accord with the proclamation of his 
                highest excellency the count, they desire to serve, not sparing 
                their lives, and it is not any kind of riot, but as his highest 
                excellence said...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count has not left, he is here, and an order will 
                be issued concerning you,&quot; said the superintendent of police. 
                &quot;Go on!&quot; he ordered his coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what 
                the superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.</p>
              <p> 　　The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with 
                a scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses 
                increased their speed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!&quot; 
                shouted the tall youth. &quot;Don't let him go, lads! Let him 
                answer us! Keep him!&quot; shouted different people and the people 
                dashed in pursuit of the trap.</p>
              <p> 　　Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly 
                the crowd went in the direction of the Lubyanka Street.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and 
                left us to perish. Do they think we're dogs?&quot; voices in the 
                crowd were heard saying more and more frequently. </p>

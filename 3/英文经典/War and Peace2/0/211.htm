              <p> 　　Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling 
                militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, 
                the battlefield could be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　It was about eleven o'clock. The sun shone somewhat to the 
                left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama 
                which, rising like an amphitheater, extended before him in the 
                clear rarefied atmosphere.</p>
              <p> 　　From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound 
                the Smolensk highroad, passing through a village with a white 
                church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below 
                it. This was Borodino. Below the village the road crossed the 
                river by a bridge and, winding down and up, rose higher and higher 
                to the village of Valuevo visible about four miles away, where 
                Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared 
                into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in the distance in 
                that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross 
                and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and 
                there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of 
                the forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite 
                masses of troops- ours and the enemy's. The ground to the right- 
                along the course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers- was broken 
                and hilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bezubova and Zakharino 
                showed in the distance. On the left the ground was more level; 
                there were fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of Semenovsk, 
                which had been burned down, could be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left 
                nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. 
                Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, 
                but only fields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, 
                villages, mounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry 
                no military &quot;position&quot; in this place which teemed with 
                life, nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy's.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I must ask someone who knows,&quot; he thought, and 
                addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge 
                unmilitary figure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I ask you,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;what village 
                that is in front?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Burdino, isn't it?&quot; said the officer, turning to 
                his companion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Borodino,&quot; the other corrected him.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, 
                moved up to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are those our men there?&quot; Pierre inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and there, further on, are the French,&quot; said 
                the officer. &quot;There they are, there... you can see them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where? Where?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on 
                the left beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression 
                that Pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into 
                his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, those are the French! And over there?...&quot; Pierre 
                pointed to a knoll on the left, near which some troops could be 
                seen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those are ours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, ours! And there?...&quot; Pierre pointed to another 
                knoll in the distance with a big tree on it, near a village that 
                lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something 
                black was visible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's his again,&quot; said the officer. (It was the 
                Shevardino Redoubt.) &quot;It was ours yesterday, but now it is 
                his.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then how about our position?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our position?&quot; replied the officer with a smile 
                of satisfaction. &quot;I can tell you quite clearly, because I 
                constructed nearly all our entrenchments. There, you see? There's 
                our center, at Borodino, just there,&quot; and he pointed to the 
                village in front of them with the white church. &quot;That's where 
                one crosses the Kolocha. You see down there where the rows of 
                hay are lying in the hollow, there's the bridge. That's our center. 
                Our right flank is over there&quot;- he pointed sharply to the 
                right, far away in the broken ground- &quot;That's where the Moskva 
                River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong 
                ones. The left flank...&quot; here the officer paused. &quot;Well, 
                you see, that's difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank 
                was there at Shevardino, you see, where the oak is, but now we 
                have withdrawn our left wing- now it is over there, do you see 
                that village and the smoke? That's Semenovsk, yes, there,&quot; 
                he pointed to Raevski's knoll. &quot;But the battle will hardly 
                be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he 
                will probably pass round to the right of the Moskva. But wherever 
                it may be, many a man will be missing tomorrow!&quot; he remarked.</p>
              <p> 　　An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he 
                was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to 
                finish speaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer's 
                remark, interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gabions must be sent for,&quot; said he sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that 
                one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but 
                ought not to speak to speak of it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, send number three company again,&quot; the officer 
                replied hurriedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you, are you one of the doctors?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I've come on my own,&quot; answered Pierre, and 
                he went down the hill again, passing the militiamen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, those damned fellows!&quot; muttered the officer 
                who followed him, holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There they are... bringing her, coming... There they 
                are... They'll be here in a minute...&quot; voices were suddenly 
                heard saying; and officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running 
                forward along the road.</p>
              <p> 　　A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino. 
                First along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded 
                and with arms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church 
                singing.</p>
              <p> 　　Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward 
                the procession.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian 
                Mother of God!&quot; someone cried.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Smolensk Mother of God,&quot; another corrected 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and 
                those who had been at work on the battery, threw down their spades 
                and ran to meet the church procession. Following the battalion 
                that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments- 
                one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers. Behind 
                them soldiers and officers bore a large, dark-faced icon with 
                an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had been brought 
                from and had since accompanied the army. Behind, before, and on 
                both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked, ran, 
                and bowed to the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the 
                men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to 
                it were relieved by others, the chanters relit their censers, 
                and service began. The hot rays of the sun beat down vertically 
                and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads 
                and with the ribbons decorating the icon. The singing did not 
                sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded 
                officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind 
                the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved 
                for them. A bald general with general with a St. George's Cross 
                on his neck stood just behind the priest's back, and without crossing 
                himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end 
                of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear to the 
                end, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. 
                Another general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking 
                his hand in front of his chest while looking about him. Standing 
                among the crowd of peasants, Pierre recognized several acquaintances 
                among these notables, but did not look at them- his whole attention 
                was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of 
                the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly 
                at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were singing the 
                service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and mechanically 
                to sing: &quot;Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of God,&quot; 
                and the priest and deacon chimed in: &quot;For to Thee under God 
                we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,&quot; 
                there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of 
                consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre 
                had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozhaysk and 
                momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and 
                heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs 
                and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against 
                Pierre. Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste 
                with which way was made for him, was approaching the icon.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and 
                on his way back to Tatarinova had stopped where the service was 
                being held. Pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, 
                which distinguished him from everybody else.</p>
              <p> 　　With a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered 
                body, with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white 
                ball of the eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying 
                gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed 
                himself with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched the 
                ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh. 
                Behind Kutuzov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence 
                of the commander in chief, who attracted the attention of all 
                the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers continued their 
                prayers without looking at him.</p>
              <p> 　　When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, 
                sank heavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long 
                time tried vainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his 
                weakness and weight. His white head twitched with the effort. 
                At last he rose, kissed the icon as a child does with naively 
                pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched the ground with 
                his hand. The other generals followed his example, then the officers, 
                and after them with excited faces, pressing on one another, crowding, 
                panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and militiamen. </p>

              <p> 　　Natasha's wedding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was 
                the last happy event in the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya 
                Rostov died that same year and, as always happens, after the father's 
                death the family group broke up.</p>
              <p> 　　The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and 
                the flight from it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, 
                Petya's death, and the old countess' grief fell blow after blow 
                on the old count's head. He seemed to be unable to understand 
                the meaning of all these events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual 
                sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish 
                him. He seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally 
                animated and enterprising.</p>
              <p> 　　The arrangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a 
                while. He ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear 
                cheerful, but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to 
                be: on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew 
                and liked him.</p>
              <p> 　　When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and 
                began to complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill 
                and took to his bed. He realized from the first that he would 
                not get up again, despite the doctor's encouragement. The countess 
                passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing. 
                Every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed 
                her hand. On his last day, sobbing, he asked her and his absent 
                son to forgive him for having dissipated their property- that 
                being the chief fault of which he was conscious. After receiving 
                communion and unction he quietly died; and next day a throng of 
                acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased 
                filled the house rented by the Rostovs. All these acquaintances, 
                who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often 
                laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach 
                and emotion, as if justifying themselves: &quot;Well, whatever 
                he may have been he was a most worthy man. You don't meet such 
                men nowadays.... And which of us has not weaknesses of his own?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was just when the count's affairs had become so involved 
                that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another 
                year that he unexpectedly died.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news 
                of his father's death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, 
                and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence 
                and went to Moscow. The state of the count's affairs became quite 
                obvious a month after his death, surprising everyone by the immense 
                total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected. 
                The debts amounted to double the value of the property.</p>
              <p> 　　Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. 
                But he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father's memory, 
                which he held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing 
                and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay 
                the debts.</p>
              <p> 　　The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a 
                vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by 
                the count's careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their 
                claims at once. As always happens in such cases rivalry sprang 
                up as to which should get paid first, and those who like Mitenka 
                held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most 
                exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was allowed no respite and 
                no peace, and those who had seemed to pity the old man- the cause 
                of their losses (if they were losses)- now remorselessly pursued 
                the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was 
                obviously not guilty of contracting them.</p>
              <p> 　　Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate 
                was sold by auction for half its value, and half the debts still 
                remained unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered 
                him by his brother-in-law Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded 
                as genuinely due for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned 
                for the remainder, as the creditors threatened, he re-entered 
                the government service.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made 
                colonel at the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as 
                her one hold on life; and so despite his reluctant to remain in 
                Moscow among people who had known him before, and despite his 
                abhorrence of the civil service, he accepted a post in Moscow 
                in that service, doffed the uniform of which he was so fond, and 
                moved with his mother and Sonya to a small house on the Sivtsev 
                Vrazhek.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and 
                had no clear idea of Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed 
                money from his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched 
                condition from him. His position was the more difficult because 
                with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep 
                himself, his mother, and Sonya, but had to shield his mother from 
                knowledge of their poverty. The countess could not conceive of 
                life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from 
                childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was for her son, 
                kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to send 
                for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, 
                or wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for 
                Natasha or Sonya, or for Nicholas himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up 
                with her whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal 
                their poverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably 
                indebted to Sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly 
                admired her patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, 
                and because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all 
                that people are valued for, but little that could have made him 
                love her. He felt that the more he valued her the less he loved 
                her. He had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his 
                freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them 
                had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas' position became worse and worse. The idea of putting 
                something aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did 
                he not save anything, but to comply with his mother's demands 
                he even incurred some small debts. He could see no way out of 
                this situation. The idea of marrying some rich woman, which was 
                suggested to him by his female relations, was repugnant to him. 
                The other way out- his mother's death- never entered his head. 
                He wished for nothing and hoped for nothing, and deep in his heart 
                experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining 
                endurance of his position. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances 
                with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he 
                avoided all distraction and recreation, and even at home did nothing 
                but play cards with his mother, pace silently up and down the 
                room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed carefully to 
                cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him 
                to endure his position. </p>

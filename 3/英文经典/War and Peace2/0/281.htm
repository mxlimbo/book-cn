              <p> 　　The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after 
                the advance of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which 
                had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders, 
                deviated from that direct course and, not finding itself pursued, 
                was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant.</p>
              <p> 　　If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius 
                leading the Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, 
                it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward 
                Moscow, describing an arc in the direction where most provisions 
                were to be found and where the country was richest.</p>
              <p> 　　That movement from the Nizhni to the Ryazan, Tula, and Kaluga 
                roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in 
                that direction, and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutuzov 
                to take his army that way. At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was 
                almost a reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army 
                along the Ryazan road, and the Emperor's letter indicated to him 
                the very position he had already occupied near Kaluga.</p>
              <p> 　　Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus 
                given by the whole campaign and by the battle of Borodino, the 
                Russian army- when the strength of that impetus was exhausted 
                and no fresh push was received- assumed the position natural to 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, 
                as it is called, but in the fact that he alone understood the 
                significance of what had happened. He alone then understood the 
                meaning of the French army's inactivity, he alone continued to 
                assert that the battle of Borodino had been a victory, he alone- 
                who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager 
                to attack- employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian 
                army from useless engagements.</p>
              <p> 　　The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing 
                hunter had left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he 
                was strong and merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly 
                the beast was heard to moan.</p>
              <p> 　　The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed 
                its calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov's 
                camp with overtures for peace.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his 
                head was right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred 
                to him, though they were meaningless. </p>
              <p> 　　MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general 
                to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your 
                Highness to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses 
                the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained 
                for your person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, 
                monsieur le Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious 
                protection!</p>
              <p>　　NAPOLEON</p>
              <p> 　　MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812 </p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov replied: &quot;I should be cursed by posterity were 
                I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such 
                is the present spirit of my nation.&quot; But he continued to 
                exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking.</p>
              <p> 　　During the month that the French troops were pillaging in 
                Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarutino, 
                a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies- 
                both in spirit and in number- as a result of which the superiority 
                had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers 
                of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that 
                change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by 
                countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston's mission; the abundance 
                of provisions at Tarutino; the reports coming in from all sides 
                of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits 
                to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian 
                soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been 
                assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has 
                been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost 
                sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now 
                scouted close up to the French stationed at Tarutino; the news 
                of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over 
                the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that 
                lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in 
                Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier's 
                mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and 
                that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial 
                change in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. 
                And at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as 
                the minute hand has completed a full circle, this change was shown 
                by an increased activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher 
                spheres. </p>

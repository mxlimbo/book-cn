              <p> 　　Through the cross streets of the Khamovniki quarter the prisoners 
                marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons 
                belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores 
                they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled 
                with private vehicles.</p>
              <p> 　　At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front 
                to get across. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines 
                of moving baggage trains before and behind them. To the right, 
                where the Kaluga road turns near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops 
                and carts stretched away into the distance. These were troops 
                of Beauharnais' corps which had started before any of the others. 
                Behind, along the riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were 
                Ney's troops and transport.</p>
              <p> 　　Davout's troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were 
                crossing the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into 
                the Kaluga road. But the baggage trains stretched out so that 
                the last of Beauharnais' train had not yet got out of Moscow and 
                reached the Kaluga road when the vanguard of Ney's army was already 
                emerging from the Great Ordynka Street.</p>
              <p> 　　When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved 
                a few steps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all 
                sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together. They 
                advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from 
                the Kaluga road, taking more than an hour to do so, and came out 
                upon the square where the streets of the Transmoskva ward and 
                the Kaluga road converge, and the prisoners jammed close together 
                had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all sides, 
                like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the 
                tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre 
                stood pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to 
                that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the 
                drums.</p>
              <p> 　　To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto 
                the wall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They've loaded 
                goods even on the cannon! Look there, those are furs!&quot; they 
                exclaimed. &quot;Just see what the blackguards have looted.... 
                There! See what that one has behind in the cart.... Why, those 
                are settings taken from some icons, by heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... 
                See how that fellow has loaded himself up, he can hardly walk! 
                Good lord, they've even grabbed those chaises!... See that fellow 
                there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens! They're fighting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's right, hit him on the snout- on his snout! Like 
                this, we shan't get away before evening. Look, look there.... 
                Why, that must be Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the monograms 
                with a crown! It's like a portable house.... That fellow's dropped 
                his sack and doesn't see it. Fighting again... A woman with a 
                baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, I dare say, that's the 
                way they'll let you pass... Just look, there's no end to it. Russian 
                wenches, by heaven, so they are! In carriages- see how comfortably 
                they've settled themselves!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Again, as at the church in Khamovniki, a wave of general curiosity 
                bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks 
                to his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted 
                their curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition 
                carts, closely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, 
                dressed in glaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill 
                voices.</p>
              <p> 　　From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the 
                mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: 
                neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying 
                away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed 
                scarcely made an impression on him- as if his soul, making ready 
                for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might 
                weaken it.</p>
              <p> 　　The women's vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, 
                soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, 
                ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their 
                movement.</p>
              <p> 　　All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some 
                invisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all 
                came flowing from the different streets with one and the same 
                desire to get on quickly; they all jostled one another, began 
                to grow angry and to fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, 
                ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side, and all the 
                faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression 
                that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal's face when 
                the drums were beating.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding 
                the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced 
                his way in among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed 
                in on all sides, emerged onto the Kaluga road.</p>
              <p> 　　They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only 
                when the sun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together 
                and the men began to prepare for their night's rest. They all 
                appeared angry and dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry 
                shouts, and fighting could be heard from all sides. A carriage 
                that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked 
                a hole in it with its pole. Several soldiers ran toward the cart 
                from different sides: some beat the carriage horses on their heads, 
                turning them aside, others fought among themselves, and Pierre 
                saw that one German was badly wounded on the head by a sword.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid 
                fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one 
                and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and 
                eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start. Once at 
                a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet 
                know where they were going, and that much that was painful and 
                difficult awaited them on this journey.</p>
              <p> 　　During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse 
                than they had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners 
                for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration.</p>
              <p> 　　From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what 
                seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected 
                contrast to their former friendly relations.</p>
              <p> 　　This spite increased still more when, on calling over the 
                roll of prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving 
                Moscow one Russian soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, 
                had escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly 
                for straying too far from the road, and heard his friend the captain 
                reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer 
                on account of the escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned 
                officer's excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk, 
                the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged 
                behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him 
                during the executions, but which be had not felt during his imprisonment, 
                now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt 
                that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush 
                him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent 
                of it.</p>
              <p> 　　He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted 
                with his comrades.</p>
              <p> 　　Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had 
                seen in Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the 
                French, or of the order to shoot them which had been announced 
                to them. As if in reaction against the worsening of their position 
                they were all particularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal 
                reminiscences, of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the 
                campaign, and avoided all talk of their present situation.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and 
                there in the sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above 
                the horizon from the rising full moon, and that vast red ball 
                swayed strangely in the gray haze. It grew light. The evening 
                was ending, but the night had not yet come. Pierre got up and 
                left his new companions, crossing between the campfires to the 
                other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier 
                prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On the road 
                he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, 
                but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his 
                legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground 
                by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while 
                sunk in thought. Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, 
                good-natured laughter, so loud that men from various sides turned 
                with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary 
                laughter could mean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ha-ha-ha!&quot; laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to 
                himself: &quot;The soldier did not let me pass. They took me and 
                shut me up. They hold me captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? 
                Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...&quot; and he laughed till tears started 
                to his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was 
                laughing at all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went 
                farther away from the inquisitive man, and looked around him.</p>
              <p> 　　The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with 
                the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown 
                quiet, the red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High 
                up in the light sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond 
                the camp, unseen before, were now visible in the distance. And 
                farther still, beyond those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, 
                limitless distance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the 
                sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths. &quot;And all 
                that is me, all that is within me, and it is all I!&quot; thought 
                Pierre. &quot;And they caught all that and put it into a shed 
                boarded up with planks!&quot; He smiled, and went and lay down 
                to sleep beside his companions. </p>

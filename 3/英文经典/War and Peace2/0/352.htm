              <p> 　　The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, 
                but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best- recollections of 
                1812. Denisov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable 
                and amusing about them. The family separated on the most friendly 
                terms.</p>
              <p> 　　After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given 
                instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went 
                to the bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still 
                at her table, writing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you writing, Mary?&quot; Nicholas asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing 
                would not be understood or approved by her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but 
                at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that 
                she would now have to tell him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A diary, Nicholas,&quot; she replied, handing him a 
                blue exercise book filled with her firm, bold writing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A diary?&quot; Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, 
                and he took up the book.</p>
              <p> 　　It was in French. </p>
              <p> 　　December 4. Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) woke up he 
                did not wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He 
                was naughty and obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. 
                Then I took the matter in hand: I left him alone and began with 
                nurse's help to get the other children up, telling him that I 
                did not love him. For a long time he was silent, as if astonished, 
                then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, and sobbed 
                so that I could not calm him for a long time. It was plain that 
                what troubled him most was that he had grieved me. Afterwards 
                in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began crying 
                piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by tenderness. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is a 'ticket'?&quot; Nicholas inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, 
                showing how they have behaved.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at 
                him, and continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary 
                was set down everything in the children's lives that seemed noteworthy 
                to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general 
                reflections on educational methods. They were for the most part 
                quite insignificant trifles, but did not seem so to the mother 
                or to the father either, now that he read this diary about his 
                children for the first time.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the date &quot;5&quot; was entered: </p>
              <p> 　　Mitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. 
                He had none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others 
                while they were eating! I think that punishment by depriving children 
                of sweets only develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant 
                eyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove 
                of her diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval 
                but also of his admiration for his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, 
                or even done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort 
                of which the sole aim was the children's moral welfare delighted 
                him. Had Nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have 
                found that his steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested 
                on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty 
                moral world, almost beyond his reach, in which she had her being.</p>
              <p> 　　He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized 
                his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and 
                rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged 
                to him but was part of himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I quite, quite approve, my dearest!&quot; said he with 
                a significant look, and after a short pause he added: &quot;And 
                I behaved badly today. You weren't in the study. We began disputing- 
                Pierre and I- and I lost my temper. But he is impossible: such 
                a child! I don't know what would become of him if Natasha didn't 
                keep him in hand.... Have you any idea why he went to Petersburg? 
                They have formed...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Countess Mary. &quot;Natasha 
                told me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, you know,&quot; Nicholas went on, growing 
                hot at the mere recollection of their discussion, &quot;he wanted 
                to convince me that it is every honest man's duty to go against 
                the government, and that the oath of allegiance and duty... I 
                am sorry you weren't there. They all fell on me- Denisov and Natasha... 
                Natasha is absurd. How she rules over him! And yet there need 
                only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only 
                repeats his sayings...&quot; added Nicholas, yielding to that 
                irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest 
                and dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about Natasha 
                could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to 
                his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I have noticed that,&quot; said Countess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, 
                he started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there- 
                what would you have said?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natasha 
                so. Pierre says everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, 
                and that it is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is 
                right there,&quot; said Countess Mary, &quot;but he forgets that 
                we have other duties nearer to us, duties indicated to us by God 
                Himself, and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we 
                must not risk our children.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's it! That's just what I said to him,&quot; 
                put in Nicholas, who fancied he really had said it. &quot;But 
                they insisted on their own view: love of one's neighbor and Christianity- 
                and all this in the presence of young Nicholas, who had gone into 
                my study and broke all my things.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about 
                little Nicholas,&quot; said Countess Mary. &quot;He is such an 
                exceptional boy. I am afraid I neglect him in favor of my own: 
                we all have children and relations while he has no one. He is 
                constantly alone with his thoughts.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I don't think you need reproach yourself on his 
                account. All that the fondest mother could do for her son you 
                have done and are doing for him, and of course I am glad of it. 
                He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This evening he listened to Pierre 
                in a sort of trance, and fancy- as we were going in to supper 
                I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits, and 
                he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an 
                untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!&quot; repeated Nicholas, who 
                at heart was not fond of Nicholas Bolkonski but was always anxious 
                to recognize that he was a fine lad.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still, I am not the same as his own mother,&quot; said 
                Countess Mary. &quot;I feel I am not the same and it troubles 
                me. A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully afraid for him. It would 
                be good for him to have companions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well it won't be for long. Next summer I'll take him 
                to Petersburg,&quot; said Nicholas. &quot;Yes, Pierre always was 
                a dreamer and always will be,&quot; he continued, returning to 
                the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him. &quot;Well, 
                what business is it of mine what goes on there- whether Arakcheev 
                is bad, and all that? What business was it of mine when I married 
                and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and 
                had a mother who could not see or understand it? And then there 
                are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own pleasure 
                that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night? 
                No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, 
                and not to leave the children such beggars as I was.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by 
                bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these 
                matters. But she knew she must not say this and that it would 
                be useless to do so. She only took his hand and kissed it. He 
                took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts, 
                and after a few minutes' reflection continued to think aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofanych&quot; (this 
                was his overseer) &quot;came back from the Tambov estate and told 
                me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility 
                of repurchasing Otradnoe before long, and added: &quot;Another 
                ten years of life and I shall leave the children... in an excellent 
                position.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that 
                he told her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he 
                would sometimes ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed 
                if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else. 
                But she had to force herself to attend, for what he was saying 
                did not interest her at all. She looked at him and did not think, 
                but felt, about something different. She felt a submissive tender 
                love for this man who would never understand all that she understood, 
                and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added 
                a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling which absorbed 
                her altogether and hindered her from following the details of 
                her husband's plans, thoughts that had no connection with what 
                he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew. 
                Her husband's account of the boy's agitation while Pierre was 
                speaking struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, 
                sensitive character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of 
                her nephew she thought also of her own children. She did not compare 
                them with him, but compared her feeling for them with her feeling 
                for him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking 
                in her feeling for young Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from 
                the difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward 
                him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the 
                impossible- in this life to love her husband, her children, little 
                Nicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess 
                Mary's soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and 
                the absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression 
                of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body 
                appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. &quot;O God! What 
                will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face 
                is like that?&quot; thought he, and placing himself before the 
                icon he began to say his evening prayers.</p>

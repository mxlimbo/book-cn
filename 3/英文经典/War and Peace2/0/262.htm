              <p> 　　On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was 
                aching, the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt 
                uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness 
                of something shameful he had done the day before. That something 
                shameful was his yesterday's conversation with Captain Ramballe.</p>
              <p> 　　It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark 
                out of doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol 
                with an engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing 
                table, he remembered where he was and what lay before him that 
                very day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Am I not too late?&quot; he thought. &quot;No, probably 
                he won't make his entry into Moscow before noon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before 
                him, but hastened to act.</p>
              <p> 　　After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about 
                to go out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that 
                he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the 
                streets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under 
                his wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or 
                under his arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not 
                had time to reload it. &quot;No matter, dagger will do,&quot; 
                he said to himself, though when planning his design he had more 
                than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by 
                the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. 
                But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, 
                but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention 
                and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took 
                the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought 
                at the Sukharev market with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low 
                on his head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making 
                a noise or meeting the captain, and passed out into the street.</p>
              <p> 　　The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference 
                the evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow 
                was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, 
                across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as 
                the barges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov 
                Bridge, were all ablaze.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and 
                from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, where he 
                had long before decided that the deed should should be done. The 
                gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up. The 
                streets and lanes were deserted. The air was full of smoke and 
                the smell of burning. Now and then he met Russians with anxious 
                and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but 
                of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians 
                and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height 
                and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his 
                face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they 
                could not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed 
                him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike 
                all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, 
                paid no attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, 
                who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand 
                them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street 
                a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but 
                only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the 
                click of the man's musket as he raised it did Pierre understand 
                that he had to pass on the other side of the street. He heard 
                nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him. He carried 
                his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something 
                dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night's experience, 
                he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring his 
                mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered 
                by anything on the way, his intention could not now have been 
                carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than four 
                hours previously on his way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the 
                Kremlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in 
                a royal study in the Kremlin, giving detailed and exact orders 
                as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, 
                to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre 
                did not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before 
                him, and was tortured- as those are who obstinately undertake 
                a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty 
                but because of its incompatibility with their natures- by the 
                fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.</p>
              <p> 　　Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way 
                by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led 
                to the Povarskoy.</p>
              <p> 　　As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and 
                denser- he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly 
                tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met 
                more people in the streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, 
                though he felt that something unusual was happening around him, 
                did not realize that he was approaching the fire. As he was going 
                along a foot path across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy 
                on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzinski's house on the 
                other, Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman 
                close to him. He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted 
                his head.</p>
              <p> 　　By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts 
                of household goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, 
                and trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman 
                no longer young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing 
                a black cloak and cap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering 
                something, was choking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, 
                dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their 
                mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. 
                The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an overcoat 
                and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his old 
                nurse's arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk, 
                and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight 
                and sniffing at her singed hair. The woman's husband, a short, 
                round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, 
                with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set 
                cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless 
                face was moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, 
                and was dragging some garments from under them.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself 
                at his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear 
                friends... help us, somebody,&quot; she muttered between her sobs. 
                &quot;My girl... My daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. 
                She's burned! Ooh! Was it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't, Mary Nikolievna!&quot; said her husband to her 
                in a low voice, evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. 
                &quot;Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?&quot; 
                he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monster! Villain!&quot; shouted the woman angrily, suddenly 
                ceasing to weep. &quot;You have no heart, you don't feel for your 
                own child! Another man would have rescued her from the fire. But 
                this is a monster and neither a man nor a father! You, honored 
                sir, are a noble man,&quot; she went on, addressing Pierre rapidly 
                between her sobs. &quot;The fire broke out alongside, and blew 
                our way, the maid called out 'Fire!' and we rushed to collect 
                our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have 
                brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is 
                lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...&quot; 
                and again she began to sob. &quot;My child, my dear one! Burned, 
                burned!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But where was she left?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that 
                this man might help her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, dear sir!&quot; she cried, seizing him by the legs. 
                &quot;My benefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you 
                horrid girl, show him the way!&quot; she cried to the maid, angrily 
                opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Show me the way, show me, I... I'll do it,&quot; gasped 
                Pierre rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up 
                her plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the 
                path. Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy 
                swoon. He held his head higher, his eyes shone with the light 
                of life, and with swift steps he followed the maid, overtook her, 
                and came out on the Povarskoy. The whole street was full of clouds 
                of black smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke through 
                that cloud. A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration. 
                In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something 
                to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing 
                to the spot where the general stood, but the French soldiers stopped 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On ne passe pas!&quot;* cried a voice. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;You can't pass! </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This way, uncle,&quot; cried the girl. &quot;We'll pass 
                through the side street, by the Nikulins'!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up 
                with her. She ran across the street, turned down a side street 
                to the left, and, passing three houses, turned into a yard on 
                the right.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's here, close by,&quot; said she and, running across 
                the yard, opened a gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed 
                out to him a small wooden wing of the house, which was burning 
                brightly and fiercely. One of its sides had fallen in, another 
                was on fire, and bright flames issued from the openings of the 
                windows and from under the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped 
                by hot air and involuntarily stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which is it? Which is your house?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ooh!&quot; wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. &quot;That's 
                it, that was our lodging. You've burned to death, our treasure, 
                Katie, my precious little missy! Ooh!&quot; lamented Aniska, who 
                at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression 
                to her feelings.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that 
                he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large 
                house that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the 
                roof, and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first 
                Pierre did not realize what these men, who were dragging something 
                out, were about; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant 
                with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, 
                he vaguely understood that looting was going on there, but he 
                had no time to dwell on that idea.</p>
              <p> 　　The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, 
                the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the 
                people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into 
                thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, 
                with here and there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like 
                golden fish scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and 
                smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating 
                effects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect 
                on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly 
                freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt young, 
                bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of 
                the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was 
                still standing, when just above his head he heard several voices 
                shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy 
                falling close beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some 
                Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled 
                with metal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went 
                up to the drawer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does this fellow want?&quot; shouted one of them 
                referring to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's a child in that house. Haven't you seen a child?&quot; 
                cried Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's he talking about? Get along!&quot; said several 
                voices, and one of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre 
                might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that 
                were in the drawer, moved threateningly toward him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A child?&quot; shouted a Frenchman from above. &quot;I 
                did hear something squealing in the garden. Perhaps it's his brat 
                that the fellow is looking for. After all, one must be human, 
                you know....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is it? Where?&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! There!&quot; shouted the Frenchman at the window, 
                pointing to the garden at the back of the house. &quot;Wait a 
                bit- I'm coming down.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow 
                with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out 
                of a window on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder 
                ran with him into the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurry up, you others!&quot; he called out to his comrades. 
                &quot;It's getting hot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman 
                pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space 
                where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a 
                seat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!&quot; 
                said the Frenchman. &quot;Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we 
                are all mortal you know!&quot; and the Frenchman with the spot 
                on his cheek ran back to his comrades.</p>
              <p> 　　Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was 
                going to take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, 
                scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began 
                to yell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her 
                in his arms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with 
                her little hands to pull Pierre's hands away and to bite them 
                with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror 
                and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty 
                little animal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down 
                and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however, impossible 
                to get back the way he had come; the maid, Aniska, was no longer 
                there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the 
                wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could 
                and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out. </p>

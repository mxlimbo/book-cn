              <p> 　　The chief action of the battle of Borodino was fought within 
                the seven thousand feet between Borodino and Bagration's fleches. 
                Beyond that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration 
                made by the Russians with Uvarov's cavalry at midday, and on the 
                other side, beyond Utitsa, Poniatowski's collision with Tuchkov; 
                but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with 
                what took place in the center of the battlefield. On the field 
                between Borodino and the fleches, beside the wood, the chief action 
                of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides 
                and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.</p>
              <p> 　　The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several 
                hundred guns.</p>
              <p> 　　Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions, 
                Campan's and Dessaix's, advanced from the French right, while 
                Murat's troops advanced on Borodino from their left.</p>
              <p> 　　From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the 
                fleches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a 
                mile as the crow flies to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not 
                see what was happening there, especially as the smoke mingling 
                with the mist hid the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix's 
                division advancing against the fleches could only be seen till 
                they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fleches. 
                As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the 
                guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered 
                the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses 
                could be caught of something black- probably men- and at times 
                the glint of bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, 
                whether they were French or Russian, could not be discovered from 
                the Shevardino Redoubt.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight 
                into Napoleon's face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked 
                at the fleches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times 
                it looked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops 
                moved. Sometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it 
                was impossible to tell what was being done there.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, 
                and in its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own 
                and sometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked 
                eye, he could not tell where what he had seen was.</p>
              <p> 　　He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed 
                intently at the battlefield.</p>
              <p> 　　But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening 
                from where he was standing down below, or from the knoll above 
                on which some of his generals had taken their stand, but even 
                from the fleches themselves- in which by this time there were 
                now Russian and now French soldiers, alternately or together, 
                dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or maddened- even at those fleches 
                themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place. 
                There for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, 
                now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, 
                and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing 
                what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.</p>
              <p> 　　From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies 
                from his marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports 
                of the progress of the action, but all these reports were false, 
                both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what 
                was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants 
                did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they 
                had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was 
                riding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances changed and 
                the news he brought was already becoming false. Thus an adjutant 
                galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodino had been occupied 
                and the bridge over the Kolocha was in the hands of the French. 
                The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross 
                it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the 
                farther side and wait. But before that order was given- almost 
                as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino- the bridge 
                had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish 
                at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle.</p>
              <p> 　　An adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened 
                face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, 
                Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant 
                had been told that the French had been repulsed, the fleches had 
                in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was 
                alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily 
                untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either 
                been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not 
                executed.</p>
              <p> 　　The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of 
                battle but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting 
                and only occasionally went within musket range, made their own 
                arrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and 
                in what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and 
                infantry should run. But even their orders, like Napoleon's, were 
                seldom carried out, and then but partially. For the most part 
                things happened contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to 
                advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain 
                where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before 
                them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry 
                dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians. In this 
                way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Semenovsk hollow 
                and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round 
                and galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the 
                same way, sometimes running to quite other places than those they 
                were ordered to go to. All orders as to where and when to move 
                the guns, when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down 
                the Russian infantry- all such orders were given by the officers 
                on the spot nearest to the units concerned, without asking either 
                Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon. They did not fear getting 
                into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their 
                own initiative, for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest 
                to man- his own life- and it sometimes seems that safety lies 
                in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men who 
                were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood 
                of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward 
                and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. 
                All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, 
                the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and 
                bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering 
                about. As soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets 
                were flying about, their superiors, located in the background, 
                re-formed them and brought them under discipline and under the 
                influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire, 
                where under the influence of fear of death they lost their discipline 
                and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng.</p>

              <p> 　　Sonya's letter written from Troitsa, which had come as an 
                answer to Nicholas' prayer, was prompted by this: the thought 
                of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess' 
                mind more and more. She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle 
                to this happening, and Sonya's life in the countess' house had 
                grown harder and harder, especially after they had received a 
                letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary 
                in Bogucharovo. The countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating 
                or cruel allusions to Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited 
                by all that was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead 
                of reproaching and making demands on her, tearfully implored her 
                to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for 
                her by breaking off her engagement with Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her 
                sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything, 
                but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide 
                to do what was demanded of her. She must sacrifice herself for 
                the family that had reared and brought her up. To sacrifice herself 
                for others was Sonya's habit. Her position in the house was such 
                that only by sacrifice could she show her worth, and she was accustomed 
                to this and loved doing it. But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice 
                she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own 
                esteem and in that of others, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas 
                whom she loved more than anything in the world. But now they wanted 
                her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward 
                for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life. And 
                for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been 
                her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt 
                jealous of Natasha who had never experienced anything of this 
                sort, had never needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice 
                themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the 
                first time Sonya felt that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas 
                a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger 
                than principle, virtue, or religion. Under the influence of this 
                feeling Sonya, whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily 
                to be secretive, having answered the countess in vague general 
                terms, avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she 
                should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but on the contrary 
                at that meeting to bind him to her forever.</p>
              <p> 　　The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last days in Moscow 
                stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad 
                to find escape from them in practical activity. But when she heard 
                of Prince Andrew's presence in their house, despite her sincere 
                pity for him and for Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious 
                feeling that God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. 
                She knew that Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never 
                ceased to love him. She knew that being thrown together again 
                under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love 
                with one another, and that Nicholas would then not be able to 
                marry Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees 
                of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had happened during 
                those last days and during the first days of their journey, this 
                feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal affairs 
                cheered Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　At the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey 
                for a whole day.</p>
              <p> 　　Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, 
                one of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was 
                much better that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the 
                next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with 
                the prior, who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors 
                of the monastery. Sonya was there too, tormented by curiosity 
                as to what Prince Andrew and Natasha were talking about. She heard 
                the sound of their voices through the door. That door opened and 
                Natasha came out, looking excited. Not noticing the monk, who 
                had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on 
                his right arm, she went up to Sonya and took her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, what are you about? Come here!&quot; said the 
                countess.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and advised 
                her to pray for aid to God and His saint.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by 
                the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, will he live?&quot; she asked. &quot;Sonya, how 
                happy I am, and how unhappy!... Sonya, dovey, everything is as 
                it used to be. If only he lives! He cannot... because... because... 
                of&quot; and Natasha burst into tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes! I knew it! Thank God!&quot; murmured Sonya. &quot;He 
                will live.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's 
                fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared 
                with no one. Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. &quot;If 
                only he lives!&quot; she thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped 
                away their tears, the two friends went together to Prince Andrew's 
                door. Natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room, 
                Sonya standing beside her at the half-open door.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His 
                pale face was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular 
                breathing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O, Natasha!&quot; Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching 
                her companion's arm and stepping back from the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What is it?&quot; asked Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's that, that...&quot; said Sonya, with a white face 
                and trembling lips.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the 
                window, not yet understanding what the latter was telling her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You remember,&quot; said Sonya with a solemn and frightened 
                expression. &quot;You remember when I looked in the mirror for 
                you... at Otradnoe at Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, 
                and vaguely recalling that Sonya had told her something about 
                Prince Andrew whom she had seen lying down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You remember?&quot; Sonya went on. &quot;I saw it then 
                and told everybody, you and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed,&quot; 
                said she, making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at 
                each detail, &quot;and that he had his eyes closed and was covered 
                just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were folded,&quot; 
                she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just 
                seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first 
                thing that came into her head, but what she had invented then 
                seemed to her now as real as any other recollection. She not only 
                remembered what she had then said- that he turned to look at her 
                and smiled and was covered with something red- but was firmly 
                convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered 
                with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, it really was pink!&quot; cried Natasha, who 
                now thought she too remembered the word pink being used, and saw 
                in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what does it mean?&quot; she added meditatively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange,&quot; replied 
                Sonya, clutching at her head.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to 
                him, but Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained 
                at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, 
                and the countess was writing to her son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya!&quot; said the countess, raising her eyes from 
                her letter as her niece passed, &quot;Sonya, won't you write to 
                Nicholas?&quot; She spoke in a soft, tremulous voice, and in the 
                weary eyes that looked over her spectacles Sonya read all that 
                the countess meant to convey with these words. Those eyes expressed 
                entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and readiness 
                for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Mamma, I will write,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred 
                that day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just 
                seen of her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's 
                relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying 
                Princess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that 
                self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and 
                loved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a 
                magnanimous deed- interrupted several times by the tears that 
                dimmed her velvety black eyes- she wrote that touching letter 
                the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.</p>

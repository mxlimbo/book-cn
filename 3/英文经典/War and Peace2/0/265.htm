              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day 
                during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor's 
                birthday, Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received 
                a dispatch from Prince Kutuzov. It was Kutuzov's report, written 
                from Tatarinova on the day of the battle. Kutuzov wrote that the 
                Russians had not retreated a step, that the French losses were 
                much heavier than ours, and that he was writing in haste from 
                the field of battle before collecting full information. It followed 
                that there must have been a victory. And at once, without leaving 
                the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator for His help and 
                for the victory.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, and all that morning 
                a joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed 
                the victory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon's 
                having been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of 
                a new ruler for France.</p>
              <p> 　　It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real 
                strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and 
                far from the scene of action. General events involuntarily group 
                themselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers' 
                pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived 
                on the Emperor's birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. 
                It was like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made 
                in Kutuzov's report of the Russian losses, among which figured 
                the names of Tuchkov, Bagration, and Kutaysov. In the Petersburg 
                world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered 
                round a single incident: Kutaysov's death. Everybody knew him, 
                the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That 
                day everyone met with the words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. 
                But what a loss Kutaysov is! How sorry I am!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What did I tell about Kutuzov?&quot; Prince Vasili now 
                said with a prophet's pride. &quot;I always said he was the only 
                man capable of defeating Napoleon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But next day no news arrived from the army and the public 
                mood grew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering 
                the suspense occasioned the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fancy the Emperor's position!&quot; said they, and instead 
                of extolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before, they condemned 
                him as the cause of the Emperor's anxiety. That day Prince Vasili 
                no longer boasted of his protege Kutuzov, but remained silent 
                when the commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, 
                as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious 
                and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added. Countess Helene 
                Bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been 
                so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone 
                said that Countess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of 
                angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned 
                of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed 
                small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect; but 
                Helene, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her 
                and that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate 
                Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose 
                of the drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be 
                rendered her. It was said that Prince Vasili and the old count 
                had turned upon the Italian, but the latter had produced such 
                letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately 
                let the matter drop.</p>
              <p> 　　Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the 
                Emperor's lack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of 
                Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　On the third day after Kutuzov's report a country gentleman 
                arrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the 
                French spread through the whole town. This was terrible! What 
                a position for the Emperor to be in! Kutuzov was a traitor, and 
                Prince Vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the 
                occasion of his daughter's death said of Kutuzov, whom he had 
                formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his grief to forget 
                what he had said), that it was impossible to expect anything else 
                from a blind and depraved old man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been 
                entrusted to such a man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to 
                doubt it, but the next day the following communication was received 
                from Count Rostopchin: </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Kutuzov's adjutant has brought me a letter in which 
                he demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road. 
                He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov's 
                action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia 
                will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which 
                her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! 
                I shall follow the army. I have had everything removed, and it 
                only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland. </p>
              <p> 　　On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski 
                to Kutuzov with the following rescript: </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Michael Ilarionovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August 
                I have received no communication from you, yet on the first of 
                September I received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via 
                Yaroslavl, the sad news that you, with the army, have decided 
                to abandon Moscow. You can yourself imagine the effect this news 
                has had on me, and your silence increases my astonishment. I am 
                sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski, to hear from 
                you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced 
                you to take this melancholy decision. </p>

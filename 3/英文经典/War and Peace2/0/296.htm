              <p> 　　Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He 
                often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying 
                on his bed without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred 
                head on his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and 
                peering into the darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had 
                more influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid 
                him, Kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself 
                and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive 
                movements. The lesson of the Tarutino battle and of the day before 
                it, which Kutuzov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have 
                some effect on others too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They must understand that we can only lose by taking 
                the offensive. Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,&quot; 
                thought Kutuzov. He knew that an apple should not be plucked while 
                it is green. It will fall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe 
                the apple is spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your teeth are set 
                on edge. Like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast 
                was wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia 
                could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally wounded or 
                not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston 
                and Barthelemi having been sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, 
                Kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed 
                further proofs and it was necessary to wait.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait 
                and we shall see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!&quot; 
                thought he. &quot;What for? Only to distinguish themselves! As 
                if fighting were fun. They are like children from whom one can't 
                get any sensible account of what has happened because they all 
                want to show how well they can fight. But that's not what is needed 
                now.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! 
                It seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies&quot; 
                (he remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) &quot;they 
                have foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at 
                Borodino was mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov's head for a 
                whole month. On the one hand the French had occupied Moscow. On 
                the other Kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible 
                blow into which he and all the Russians had put their whole strength 
                must have been mortal. But in any case proofs were needed; he 
                had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the 
                longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those sleepless nights 
                he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing. 
                He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like the 
                younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of 
                contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. 
                The longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. 
                He imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a 
                whole or in sections- against Petersburg, or against him, or to 
                outflank him. He thought too of the possibility (which he feared 
                most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon 
                and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutuzov even imagined that 
                Napoleon's army might turn back through Medyn and Yukhnov, but 
                the one thing he could not foresee was what happened- the insane, 
                convulsive stampede of Napoleon's army during its first eleven 
                days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what 
                Kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of- the complete extermination 
                of the French. Dorokhov's report about Broussier's division, the 
                guerrillas' reports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors of 
                preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition 
                that the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But 
                these were only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger 
                men but not to Kutuzov. With his sixty years' experience he knew 
                what value to attach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire 
                anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what 
                they desire, and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all 
                that makes for the contrary. And the more he desired it the less 
                he allowed himself to believe it. This question absorbed all his 
                mental powers. All else was to him only life's customary routine. 
                To such customary routine belonged his conversations with the 
                staff, the letters he wrote from Tarutino to Madame de Stael, 
                the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence 
                with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, 
                which he alone foresaw, was his heart's one desire.</p>
              <p> 　　On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on 
                his arm and thinking of that.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of 
                Toll, Konovnitsyn, and Bolkhovitinov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, who's there? Come in, come in! What news?&quot; 
                the field marshal called out to them.</p>
              <p> 　　While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the 
                substance of the news.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who brought it?&quot; asked Kutuzov with a look which, 
                when the candle was lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Call him in, call him here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and 
                his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under 
                him. He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger 
                more carefully, as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied 
                his own mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell me, tell me, friend,&quot; said he to Bolkhovitinov 
                in his low, aged voice, as he pulled together the shirt which 
                gaped open on his chest, &quot;come nearer- nearer. What news 
                have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon has left Moscow? Are you 
                sure? Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of 
                all he had been told to report.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture me!&quot; Kutuzov 
                interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting 
                instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutuzov 
                checked him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly 
                puckered and wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to 
                the opposite side of the room, to the corner darkened by the icons 
                that hung there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...&quot; 
                said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands. &quot;Russia is 
                saved. I thank Thee, O Lord!&quot; and he wept. </p>

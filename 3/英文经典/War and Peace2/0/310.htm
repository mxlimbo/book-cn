              <p> 　　During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders 
                had been issued by the French authorities concerning the party 
                of prisoners among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October 
                that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains 
                with which it had left Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack 
                that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured 
                by Cossacks, the other half had gone on ahead. Not one of those 
                dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners 
                was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery the prisoners 
                had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced 
                by Marshal Junot's enormous baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. 
                Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.</p>
              <p> 　　From Vyazma onwards the French army, which had till then moved 
                in three columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder 
                that Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving 
                Moscow had now reached the utmost limit.</p>
              <p> 　　The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides 
                by dead horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various 
                regiments continually changed about, now joining the moving column, 
                now again lagging behind it.</p>
              <p> 　　Several times during the march false alarms had been given 
                and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, 
                and run headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled 
                and abused each other for their causeless panic.</p>
              <p> 　　These three groups traveling together- the cavalry stores, 
                the convoy of prisoners, and Junot's baggage train- still constituted 
                a separate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly 
                melting away.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred 
                and twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest 
                had been captured or left behind. Some of Junot's wagons also 
                had been captured or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and 
                robbed by stragglers from Davout's corps. From the talk of the 
                Germans Pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to 
                that baggage train than to the prisoners, and that one of their 
                comrades, a German soldier, had been shot by the marshal's own 
                order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been 
                found in his possession.</p>
              <p> 　　The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the 
                three hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer 
                than a hundred now remained. The prisoners were more burdensome 
                to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. 
                They understood that the saddles and Junot's spoon might be of 
                some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand 
                and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who froze and lagged 
                behind on the road (in which case the order was to shoot them) 
                was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the escort, 
                as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in, 
                of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering 
                their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness 
                and severity.</p>
              <p> 　　At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking 
                the prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, 
                several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran 
                away, but were recaptured by the French and shot.</p>
              <p> 　　The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer 
                prisoners should be kept separate from the rest, had long since 
                been abandoned. All who could walk went together, and after the 
                third stage Pierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged 
                dog that had chosen Karataev for its master.</p>
              <p> 　　On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell 
                ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, 
                and as he grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre 
                did not know why, but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker 
                it had cost him an effort to go near him. When he did so and heard 
                the subdued moaning with which Karataev generally lay down at 
                the halting places, and when he smelled the odor emanating from 
                him which was now stronger than before, Pierre moved farther away 
                and did not think about him.</p>
              <p> 　　While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his 
                intellect but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is 
                created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction 
                of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from 
                privation but from superfluity. And now during these last three 
                weeks of the march he had learned still another new, consolatory 
                truth- that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned 
                that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely 
                free, so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and 
                lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their 
                limits and that those limits are very near together; that the 
                person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly 
                as he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing 
                chilled while the other was warming; and that when he had put 
                on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when 
                he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores- his footgear 
                having long since fallen to pieces. He discovered that when he 
                had married his wife- of his own free will as it had seemed to 
                him- he had been no more free than now when they locked him up 
                at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently termed 
                his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst 
                was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh 
                was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder 
                they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great 
                cold, it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night 
                there were the campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his 
                body.) The one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　After the second day's march Pierre, having examined his feet 
                by the campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; 
                but when everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he 
                had warmed up, walked without feeling the pain, though at night 
                his feet were more terrible to look at than before. However, he 
                did not look at them now, but thought of other things.</p>
              <p> 　　Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man 
                and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from 
                one thing to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler 
                that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds 
                a certain limit.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners 
                who lagged behind, though more than a hundred perished in that 
                way. He did not think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and 
                evidently would soon have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre 
                think about himself. The harder his position became and the more 
                terrible the future, the more independent of that position in 
                which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts, 
                memories, and imaginings that came to him. </p>

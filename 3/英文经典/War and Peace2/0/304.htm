              <p> 　　After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's 
                attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he 
                seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse 
                and rode back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy,&quot; he said to 
                Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, peering 
                into the forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, 
                swinging arms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan 
                hat, was approaching with long, light steps. He had a musketoon 
                over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied 
                Denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes, removed his 
                sodden hat by its floppy brim, and approached his commander. It 
                was Tikhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little 
                eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head 
                high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, where did you disappear to?&quot; inquired Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,&quot; 
                answered Tikhon boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious 
                bass voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You 
                ass! Well, why haven't you taken one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I took one all right,&quot; said Tikhon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, I took him first thing at dawn,&quot; Tikhon 
                continued, spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in 
                their bast shoes. &quot;I took him into the forest. Then I see 
                he's no good and think I'll go and fetch a likelier one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see?... What a wogue- it's just as I thought,&quot; 
                said Denisov to the esaul. &quot;Why didn't you bwing that one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What was the good of bringing him?&quot; Tikhon interrupted 
                hastily and angrily- &quot;that one wouldn't have done for you. 
                As if I don't know what sort you want!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a bwute you are!... Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I went for another one,&quot; Tikhon continued, &quot;and 
                I crept like this through the wood and lay down.&quot; (He suddenly 
                lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he 
                had done it.) &quot;One turned up and I grabbed him, like this.&quot; 
                (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) &quot;'Come along to the colonel,' 
                I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of them. 
                They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went for them 
                with my ax, this way: 'What are you up to?' says I. 'Christ be 
                with you!'&quot; shouted Tikhon, waving his arms with an angry 
                scowl and throwing out his chest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels 
                through the puddles!&quot; said the esaul, screwing up his glittering 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained 
                from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to 
                the esaul's and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't play the fool!&quot; said Denisov, coughing angrily. 
                &quot;Why didn't you bwing the first one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with 
                the other, then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, 
                foolish grin, disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that 
                was why he was called Shcherbaty- the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, 
                and Petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon 
                himself joined.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,&quot; said 
                Tikhon. &quot;The clothes on him- poor stuff! How could I bring 
                him? And so rude, your honor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son 
                myself, I won't go!' he says.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a bwute!&quot; said Denisov. &quot;I wanted 
                to question...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I questioned him,&quot; said Tikhon. &quot;He said 
                he didn't know much. 'There are a lot of us,' he says, 'but all 
                poor stuff- only soldiers in name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' 
                he says, 'and you'll take them all,'&quot; Tikhon concluded, looking 
                cheerfully and resolutely into Denisov's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes- that'll teach 
                you to play the fool!&quot; said Denisov severely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why are you angry?&quot; remonstrated Tikhon, &quot;just 
                as if I'd never seen your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark 
                and I'll fetch you any of them you want- three if you like.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, let's go,&quot; said Denisov, and rode all the 
                way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing 
                with him and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into 
                the bushes.</p>
              <p> 　　When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon's words 
                and smile had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this 
                Tikhon had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the 
                captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness 
                lasted only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, 
                to brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of importance 
                about tomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be unworthy of 
                the company in which he found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the 
                way with the news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was 
                well with him.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov at once cheered up and, calling Petya to him, said: 
                &quot;Well, tell me about yourself.&quot;</p>

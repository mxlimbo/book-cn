              <p> 　　The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino, of our losses 
                in killed and wounded, and the still more terrible news of the 
                loss of Moscow reached Voronezh in the middle of September. Princess 
                Mary, having learned of her brother's wound only from the Gazette 
                and having no definite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, 
                he had not seen her again himself) to set off in search of Prince 
                Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the 
                abandonment of Moscow, Rostov was not seized with despair, anger, 
                the desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything 
                in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced 
                an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations 
                he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge 
                all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything 
                again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying the 
                horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and 
                squadron quartermaster.</p>
              <p> 　　A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at 
                which Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the 
                Russian victory. He stood a little behind the governor and held 
                himself with military decorum through the service, meditating 
                on a great variety of subjects. When the service was over the 
                governor's wife beckoned him to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you seen the princess?&quot; she asked, indicating 
                with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side, 
                beyond the choir.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much 
                by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, 
                timidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, 
                evidently engrossed by her thoughts, was crossing herself for 
                the last time before leaving the church.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same 
                face he had seen before, there was the same general expression 
                of refined, inner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently 
                lit up. There was a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and 
                hope in it. As had occurred before when she was present, Nicholas 
                went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor's 
                wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper 
                to address her here in church, and told her he had heard of her 
                trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as she heard 
                his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both her 
                sorrow and her joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,&quot; 
                said Rostov. &quot;It is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikolievich, 
                were not living, it would have been at once announced in the Gazette, 
                as he is a colonel.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, 
                but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound&quot; 
                (the Gazette said it was a shell) &quot;either proving fatal at 
                once or being very slight,&quot; continued Nicholas. &quot;We 
                must hope for the best, and I am sure...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, that would be so dread...&quot; she began and, prevented 
                by agitation from finishing, she bent her head with a movement 
                as graceful as everything she did in his presence and, looking 
                up at him gratefully, went out, following her aunt.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to 
                settle some accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished 
                that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still 
                too early to go to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down 
                the room, reflecting on his life, a thing he rarely did.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when 
                he had met her in Smolensk province. His having encountered her 
                in such exceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one 
                time mentioned her to him as a good match, had drawn his particular 
                attention to her. When he met her again in Voronezh the impression 
                she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas 
                had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her 
                at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and it had 
                not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself 
                of chances of meeting her. But that day's encounter in church 
                had, he felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of 
                mind. That pale, sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle 
                graceful gestures, and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed 
                in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men 
                Rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual 
                life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he referred 
                to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess, but in Princess 
                Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual 
                world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!&quot; he 
                said to himself. &quot;Why am I not free? Why was I in such a 
                hurry with Sonya?&quot; And he involuntarily compared the two: 
                the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in 
                the other- a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued 
                most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free. 
                How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. 
                But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear 
                picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured 
                to himself a future with Sonya, and that was all clear and simple 
                just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there 
                was in Sonya, but it was impossible to picture a future with Princess 
                Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.</p>
              <p> 　　Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in 
                them, but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a 
                little frightening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How she prayed!&quot; he thought. &quot;It was plain 
                that her whole soul was in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer 
                that moves mountains, and I am sure her prayer will be answered. 
                Why don't I pray for what I want?&quot; he suddenly thought. &quot;What 
                do I want? To be free, released from Sonya... She was right,&quot; 
                he thought, remembering what the governor's wife had said: &quot;Nothing 
                but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya. Muddles, grief for 
                Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles! Besides, 
                I don't love her- not as I should. O, God! release me from this 
                dreadful, inextricable position!&quot; he suddenly began to pray. 
                &quot;Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith 
                and not pray as Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow 
                might turn into sugar- and then run out into the yard to see whether 
                it had done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now,&quot; 
                he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his 
                hands placed himself before the icon. Softened by memories of 
                Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time. 
                Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened 
                and Lavrushka came in with some papers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?&quot; 
                cried Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From the governor,&quot; said Lavrushka in a sleepy 
                voice. &quot;A courier has arrived and there's a letter for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, all right, thanks. You can go!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother 
                and the other from Sonya. He recognized them by the handwriting 
                and opened Sonya's first. He had read only a few lines when he 
                turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's not possible!&quot; he cried aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding 
                the letter and reading it. He glanced through it, then read it 
                again, and then again, and standing still in the middle of the 
                room he raised his shoulders, stretching out his hands, with his 
                mouth wide open and his eyes fixed. What he had just been praying 
                for with confidence that God would hear him had come to pass; 
                but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary 
                and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it had happened so 
                quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he had prayed, 
                but by some ordinary coincidence.</p>
              <p> 　　This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary 
                letter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and 
                from which there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last 
                unfortunate events- the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs' 
                Moscow property- and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that 
                Nicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his 
                silence and coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide 
                to release him from his promise and set him completely free. </p>
              <p> 　　It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause 
                of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me 
                (she wrote), and my love has no aim but the happiness of those 
                I love; so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself free, and 
                to be assured that, in spite of everything, no one can love you 
                more than does</p>
              <p align="right">　　 Your Sonya</p>
              <p> 　　Both letters were written from Troitsa. The other, from the 
                countess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, 
                the fire, and the destruction of all their property. In this letter 
                the countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded 
                traveling with them; his state was very critical, but the doctor 
                said there was now more hope. Sonya and Natasha were nursing him.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see 
                Princess Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what &quot;Natasha 
                nursing him&quot; might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas 
                suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they 
                were relations.</p>
              <p> 　　The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey 
                to Yaroslavl, and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.

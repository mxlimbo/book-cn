              <p> 　　This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which 
                they did all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they 
                turned onto the Kaluga road to the day their leader fled from 
                the army, none of the movements of the crowd had any sense. So 
                one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign 
                the historians, who attributed the actions of the mass to the 
                will of one man, would have found it impossible to make the story 
                of the retreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of books have 
                been written by the historians about this campaign, and everywhere 
                are described Napoleon's arrangements, the maneuvers, and his 
                profound plans which guided the army, as well as the military 
                genius shown by his marshals.</p>
              <p> 　　The retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he had a free road 
                into a well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to 
                him along which Kutuzov afterwards pursued him- this unnecessary 
                retreat along a devastated road- is explained to us as being due 
                to profound considerations. Similarly profound considerations 
                are given for his retreat from Smolensk to Orsha. Then his heroism 
                at Krasnoe is described, where he is reported to have been prepared 
                to accept battle and take personal command, and to have walked 
                about with a birch stick and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;J'ai assez fait l'empereur; il est temps de faire le 
                general,&quot;* but nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning 
                to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to 
                act the general.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, 
                especially of Ney- a greatness of soul consisting in this: that 
                he made his way by night around through the forest and across 
                the Dnieper and escaped to Orsha, abandoning standards, artillery, 
                and nine tenths of his men.</p>
              <p> 　　And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from 
                his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something 
                great and characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, 
                described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness 
                which every child is taught to be ashamed of- even that act finds 
                justification in the historians' language.</p>
              <p> 　　When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads 
                of historical ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly 
                contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just, the historians 
                produce a saving conception of &quot;greatness.&quot; &quot;Greatness,&quot; 
                it seems, excludes the standards of right and wrong. For the &quot;great&quot; 
                man nothing is wrong, there is no atrocity for which a &quot;great&quot; 
                man can be blamed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;C'est grand!&quot;* say the historians, and there no 
                longer exists either good or evil but only &quot;grand&quot; and 
                &quot;not grand.&quot; Grand is good, not grand is bad. Grand 
                is the characteristic, in their conception, of some special animals 
                called &quot;heroes.&quot; And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm 
                fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades 
                but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que 
                c'est grand,*[2] and his soul is tranquil. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;It is great.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] That it is great. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au 
                ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas,&quot;* said he. And the whole world 
                for fifty years has been repeating: &quot;Sublime! Grand! Napoleon 
                le Grand!&quot; Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable 
                with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one's 
                own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.</p>
              <p> 　　For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, 
                no human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness 
                where simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent. </p>

              <p> 　　There was nothing in Pierre's soul now at all like what had 
                troubled it during his courtship of Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame 
                the words he had spoken, or say: &quot;Oh, why did I not say that?&quot; 
                and, &quot;Whatever made me say 'Je vous aime'?&quot; On the contrary, 
                he now repeated in imagination every word that he or Natasha had 
                spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile, and did 
                not wish to diminish or add anything, but only to repeat it again 
                and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as 
                to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong. Only one 
                terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: &quot;Wasn't it all 
                a dream? Isn't Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited 
                and self-confident? I believe all this- and suddenly Princess 
                Mary will tell her, and she will be sure to smile and say: 'How 
                strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn't he know that he 
                is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something altogether different 
                and higher.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not 
                now make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable 
                that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. 
                Everything ended with that.</p>
              <p> 　　A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself 
                incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life- not for him 
                alone but for the whole world- seemed to him centered in his love 
                and the possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody 
                seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only- his future happiness. 
                Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased 
                as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending 
                to be busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he 
                saw allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met 
                by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express 
                a secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized 
                that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them 
                with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them 
                that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy 
                of attention.</p>
              <p> 　　When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil 
                service, or when the war or any general political affairs were 
                discussed on the assumption that everybody's welfare depended 
                on this or that issue of events, he would listen with a mild and 
                pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments. But 
                at this time he saw everybody- both those who, as he imagined, 
                understood the real meaning of life (that is, what he was feeling) 
                and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it- in 
                the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself, and 
                at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that 
                was good and worthy of being loved.</p>
              <p> 　　When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, 
                her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not 
                known the bliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having obtained 
                a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at 
                this time, seemed to him a pathetic, kindly old man much to be 
                pitied.</p>
              <p> 　　Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful 
                insanity. All the views he formed of men and circumstances at 
                this time remained true for him always. He not only did not renounce 
                them subsequently, but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, 
                he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness 
                and they always proved correct.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I may have appeared strange and queer then,&quot; he 
                thought, &quot;but I was not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary 
                I was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time, 
                and understood all that is worth understanding in life, because... 
                because I was happy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to 
                do, to discover personal attributes which he termed &quot;good 
                qualities&quot; in people before loving them; his heart was now 
                overflowing with love, and by loving people without cause he discovered 
                indubitable causes for loving them. </p>

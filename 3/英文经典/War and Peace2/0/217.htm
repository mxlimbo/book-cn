              <p> 　　On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, 
                Napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, 
                considering plans submitted to him by his marshals, and personally 
                giving commands to his generals.</p>
              <p> 　　The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolocha 
                had been dislocated by the capture of the Shevardino Redoubt on 
                the twenty-fourth, and part of the line- the left flank- had been 
                drawn back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front 
                of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was 
                evident to anyone, military or not, that it was here the French 
                should attack. It would seem that not much consideration was needed 
                to reach this conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on 
                the part of the Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need 
                of that special and supreme quality called genius that people 
                are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the historians who described 
                the event later and the men who then surrounded Napoleon, and 
                he himself, thought otherwise.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with 
                a profound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his 
                head dubiously, and without communicating to the generals around 
                him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely 
                gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands. Having 
                listened to a suggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince 
                d'Eckmuhl, to turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should 
                not be done, without explaining why not. To a proposal made by 
                General Campan (who was to attack the fleches) to lead his division 
                through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though the so-called Duke 
                of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through 
                the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.</p>
              <p> 　　Having inspected the country opposite the Shevardino Redoubt, 
                Napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots 
                where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against 
                the Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with 
                them, the field artillery should be placed.</p>
              <p> 　　After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, 
                and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his 
                dictation.</p>
              <p> 　　These dispositions, of which the French historians write with 
                enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as 
                follows: </p>
              <p> 　　At dawn the two new batteries established during the night 
                on the plain occupied by the Prince d'Eckmuhl will open fire on 
                the opposing batteries of the enemy.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st 
                Corps, General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan's division 
                and all the howitzers of Dessaix's and Friant's divisions, will 
                move forward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy's 
                battery, against which will operate: </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　　　　　24 guns of the artillery of the Guards</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　　　　　30 guns of Campan's division</p>
              <p> 　　and　　　　　　8 guns of Friant's and Dessaix's divisions</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　　　　　--</p>
              <p> 　　in all　　62 guns. </p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche, 
                will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in 
                all, on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment 
                on the left, which will have forty guns in all directed against 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance 
                with all the howitzers of the Guard's artillery against either 
                one or other of the entrenchments.</p>
              <p> 　　During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through 
                the wood on the village and turn the enemy's position.</p>
              <p> 　　General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first 
                fortification.</p>
              <p> 　　After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be 
                given in accordance with the enemy's movements.</p>
              <p> 　　The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the 
                guns of the right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand's 
                division and of the vice-King's division will open a heavy fire 
                on seeing the attack commence on the right wing.</p>
              <p> 　　The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three 
                bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand's and Gibrard's 
                divisions, which under his leadership will be directed against 
                the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</p>
              <p> 　　All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec 
                ordre et methode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.</p>
              <p> 　　　　 The Imperial Camp near Mozhaysk,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 September, 6, 1812. </p>
              <p> 　　These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if 
                one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious 
                awe of his genius, related to Napoleon's orders to deal with four 
                points- four different orders. Not one of these was, or could 
                be, carried out.</p>
              <p> 　　In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed 
                on the spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and 
                Fouche; which were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, 
                were to open fire and shower shells on the Russian fleches and 
                redoubts. This could not be done, as from the spots selected by 
                Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works, and 
                those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander, 
                contrary to Napoleon's instructions, moved them forward.</p>
              <p> 　　The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village 
                through the wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could 
                not be done and was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on 
                the village through the wood, met Tuchkov there barring his way, 
                and could not and did not turn the Russian position.</p>
              <p> 　　The third order was: General Campan will move through the 
                wood to seize the first fortification. General Campan's division 
                did not seize the first fortification but was driven back, for 
                on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of 
                which Napoleon was unaware.</p>
              <p> 　　The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village 
                (Borodino) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same 
                heights as Morand's and Gdrard's divisions (for whose movements 
                no directions are given), which under his leadership will be directed 
                against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</p>
              <p> 　　As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible 
                sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the 
                orders given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino 
                to the redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to 
                advance simultaneously from the front.</p>
              <p> 　　All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not 
                and could not be executed. After passing through Borodino the 
                vice-King was driven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; 
                while the divisions of Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt 
                but were driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end 
                of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and 
                not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition 
                was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said 
                that, after the fight has commenced in this manner, orders will 
                be given in accordance with the enemy's movements, and so it might 
                be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon 
                during the battle. But this was not and could not be done, for 
                during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared 
                later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one 
                of his orders during the fight could be executed.</p>

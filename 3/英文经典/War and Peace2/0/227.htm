              <p> 　　One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained 
                apron, holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of 
                one of his small bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He 
                raised his head and looked about him, but above the level of the 
                wounded men. He evidently wanted a little respite. After turning 
                his head from right to left for some time, he sighed and looked 
                down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, immediately,&quot; he replied to a dresser 
                who pointed Prince Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry 
                him into the tent.</p>
              <p> 　　Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It seems that even in the next world only the gentry 
                are to have a chance!&quot; remarked one.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had 
                only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince 
                Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The 
                pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, 
                stomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged 
                into a general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that 
                seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, 
                on that hot August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond 
                beside the Smolensk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same 
                chair a canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with 
                horror, as by a presentiment.</p>
              <p> 　　There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, 
                and on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while 
                he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking 
                place on the other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, 
                probably a Cossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside 
                him. Four soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was 
                cutting into his muscular brown back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ooh, ooh, ooh!&quot; grunted the Tartar, and suddenly 
                lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, 
                and baring his white teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his 
                body and utter piercing, ringing, and prolonged yells. On the 
                other table, round which many people were crowding, a tall well-fed 
                man lay on his back with his head thrown back. His curly hair, 
                its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar 
                to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest 
                to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly 
                all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking 
                convulsively. Two doctors- one of whom was pale and trembling- 
                were silently doing something to this man's other, gory leg. When 
                he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, 
                the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　He glanced at Prince Andrew's face and quickly turned away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Undress him! What are you waiting for?&quot; he cried 
                angrily to the dressers.</p>
              <p> 　　His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back 
                to Prince Andrew's mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up 
                began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed 
                him. The doctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed 
                deeply. Then he made a sign to someone, and the torturing pain 
                in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose consciousness. When 
                he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had 
                been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. 
                Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince Andrew 
                opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on 
                the lips, and hurried away.</p>
              <p> 　　After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed 
                a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. 
                All the best and happiest moments of his life- especially his 
                earliest childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, 
                and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, 
                burying his head in the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness 
                of life- returned to his memory, not merely as something past 
                but as something present.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape 
                of whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting 
                him up and trying to quiet him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!&quot; his 
                frightened moans could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken 
                by sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted Andrew wanted to 
                weep. Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he 
                was sorry to part with life, or because of those memories of a 
                childhood that could not return, or because he was suffering and 
                others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously- 
                he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.</p>
              <p> 　　The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted 
                blood and with the boot still on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! Oh, ooh!&quot; he sobbed, like a woman.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince 
                Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My God! What is this? Why is he here?&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just 
                been amputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting 
                him in their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, 
                swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. 
                &quot;Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully 
                connected with me,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly 
                grasping what he saw before him. &quot;What is the connection 
                of that man with my childhood and life?&quot; he asked himself 
                without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected memory 
                from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself 
                to him. He remembered Natasha as he had seen her for the first 
                time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with 
                a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness 
                for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. 
                He now remembered the connection that existed between himself 
                and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled 
                his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic pity 
                and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender 
                loving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own 
                and their errors.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love 
                us and for those who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love 
                which God preached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me 
                and I did not understand- that is what made me sorry to part with 
                life, that is what remained for me had I lived. But now it is 
                too late. I know it!&quot; </p>

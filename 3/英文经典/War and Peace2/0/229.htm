              <p> 　　Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures 
                and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the 
                Davydov family and to the crown serfs- those fields and meadows 
                where for hundreds of years the peasants of Borodino, Gorki, Shevardino, 
                and Semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. 
                At the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with 
                blood for a space of some three acres around. Crowds of men of 
                various arms, wounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged 
                themselves back to Mozhaysk from the one army and back to Valuevo 
                from the other. Other crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward 
                led by their officers. Others held their ground and continued 
                to fire.</p>
              <p> 　　Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the 
                glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, 
                there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell 
                of saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began 
                to fall on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, 
                and hesitating men, as if to say: &quot;Enough, men! Enough! Cease... 
                bethink yourselves! What are you doing?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and 
                rest, it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should 
                continue to slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, 
                and the question arose in every soul: &quot;For what, for whom, 
                must I kill and be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, 
                but I don't want to do so anymore!&quot; By evening this thought 
                had ripened in every soul. At any moment these men might have 
                been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have 
                thrown up everything and run away anywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the 
                horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad 
                to leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued 
                to control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, 
                aimed, and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived 
                out of every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue, 
                perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls 
                flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human 
                bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the will 
                of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.</p>
              <p> 　　Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army 
                would have said that, if only the French made one more slight 
                effort, it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of 
                the French army would have said that the Russians need only make 
                one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed. But 
                neither the French nor the Russians made that effort, and the 
                flame of battle burned slowly out.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians did not make that effort because they were not 
                attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood 
                blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of 
                the battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians 
                been to drive the French from their positions, they could not 
                have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been 
                broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not 
                suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions 
                they had lost ONE HALF of their army.</p>
              <p> 　　The French, with the memory of all their former victories 
                during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon's invincibility, 
                with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield 
                and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards 
                intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. 
                The French had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it 
                from its position ought to have made that effort, for as long 
                as the Russians continued to block the road to Moscow as before, 
                the aim of the French had not been attained and all their efforts 
                and losses were in vain. But the French did not make that effort. 
                Some historians say that Napoleon need only have used his Old 
                Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have been won. To 
                speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his Guards 
                is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. 
                It could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because 
                he did not want to, but because it could not be done. All the 
                generals, officers. and soldiers of the French army knew it could 
                not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would not 
                permitit.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare 
                feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the 
                generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part 
                in the battle or not, after all their experience of previous battles- 
                when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled- experienced 
                a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who, after losing 
                HALF his men, stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning 
                of the battle. The moral force of the attacking French army was 
                exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture 
                of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called standards, and 
                of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing, 
                but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority 
                of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the Russians 
                at Borodino. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal that 
                has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were 
                perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, 
                weaker by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the 
                French army was still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, 
                without further effort on the part of the Russians, it had to 
                perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodino. 
                The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was Napoleon's 
                senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old Smolensk 
                road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand 
                men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at Borodino 
                for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit 
                had been laid. </p>

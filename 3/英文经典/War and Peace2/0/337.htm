              <p> 　　After Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha 
                had said to Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: &quot;He 
                looks just, yes, just as if he had come out of a Russian bath- 
                in a short coat and with his hair cropped,&quot; something hidden 
                and unknown to herself, but irrepressible, awoke in Natasha's 
                soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly 
                altered. To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness 
                rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening 
                she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her. She 
                no longer complained of her position, did not say a word about 
                the past, and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future. 
                She spoke little of Pierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned him 
                a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her 
                lips curved with a strange smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The change that took place in Natasha at first surprised Princess 
                Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. &quot;Can 
                she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him 
                so soon?&quot; she thought when she reflected on the change. But 
                when she was with Natasha she was not vexed with her and did not 
                reproach her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Natasha 
                was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her 
                presence Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach 
                her even in her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　 Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new 
                feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no 
                longer sad, but bright and cheerful.</p>
              <p> 　　When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal 
                talk with Pierre, Natasha met her on the threshold.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?&quot; she repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness 
                for her joy settled on Natasha's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would 
                tell me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Understandable and touching as the look with which Natasha 
                gazed at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to 
                see her agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered 
                her brother and his love.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what's to be done? She can't help it,&quot; thought 
                the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natasha all 
                that Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg 
                Natasha was astounded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Petersburg!&quot; she repeated as if unable to understand.</p>
              <p> 　　But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary's face 
                she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary,&quot; said she, &quot;tell me what I should do! 
                I am afraid of being bad. Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell 
                me....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You love him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,&quot; 
                said Princess Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha's 
                joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It won't be just yet- someday. Think what fun it will 
                be when I am his wife and you marry Nicholas!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let 
                us talk about you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They were silent awhile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why go to Petersburg?&quot; Natasha suddenly asked, 
                and hastily replied to her own question. &quot;But no, no, he 
                must... Yes, Mary, He must....&quot; </p>

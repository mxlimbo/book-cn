              <p> 　　&quot;Well, that's all!&quot; said Kutuzov as he signed the 
                last of the documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the 
                folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more 
                cheerful expression.</p>
              <p> 　　The priest's wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she 
                had after all not managed to present at the right moment, though 
                she had so long been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered 
                it to Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, 
                and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them 
                on the dish for her. &quot;Well, my dear, and how are we getting 
                on?&quot; he asked, moving to the door of the room assigned to 
                him. The priest's wife smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks 
                followed him into the room. The adjutant came out to the porch 
                and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour later 
                Prince Andrew was again called to Kutuzov. He found him reclining 
                in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned overcoat. He had 
                in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered, 
                marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the cover 
                that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, sit down, sit down here. Let's have a talk,&quot; 
                said Kutuzov. &quot;It's sad, very sad. But remember, my dear 
                fellow, that I am a father to you, a second father....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father's death, 
                and what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What... what they have brought us to!&quot; Kutuzov 
                suddenly cried in an agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly 
                to himself from Prince Andrew's story the condition Russia was 
                in. &quot;But give me time, give me time!&quot; he said with a 
                grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation, 
                and added: &quot;I sent for you to keep you with me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am longer 
                fit for the staff,&quot; replied Prince Andrew with a smile which 
                Kutuzov noticed.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But above all,&quot; added Prince Andrew, &quot;I have 
                grown used to my regiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy 
                the men also like me. I should be sorry to leave the regiment. 
                If I decline the honor of being with you, believe me...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutuzov's 
                podgy face. He cut Bolkonski short.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sorry, for I need you. But you're right, you're 
                right! It's not here that men are needed. Advisers are always 
                plentiful, but men are not. The regiments would not be what they 
                are if the would-be advisers served there as you do. I remember 
                you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember you with the 
                standard!&quot; said Kutuzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused 
                Prince Andrew's face at this recollection.</p>
              <p> 　　Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutuzov offered 
                his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears 
                in the old man's eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutuzov's 
                tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and 
                considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, 
                yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is 
                the path of honor!&quot; He paused. &quot;I missed you at Bucharest, 
                but I needed someone to send.&quot; And changing the subject, 
                Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had 
                been concluded. &quot;Yes, I have been much blamed,&quot; he said, 
                &quot;both for that war and the peace... but everything came at 
                the right time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre.* 
                And there were as many advisers there as here...&quot; he went 
                on, returning to the subject of &quot;advisers&quot; which evidently 
                occupied him. &quot;Ah, those advisers!&quot; said he. &quot;If 
                we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with 
                Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything 
                in haste, but more haste, less speed. Kamenski would have been 
                lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand 
                men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult 
                to win a campaign. For that, storming and attacking but patience 
                and time are wanted. Kamenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I 
                only employed these two things and took more fortresses than Kamenski 
                and made the but eat horseflesh!&quot; He swayed his head. &quot;And 
                the French shall too, believe me,&quot; he went on, growing warmer 
                and beating his chest, &quot;I'll make them eat horseflesh!&quot; 
                And tears again dimmed his eyes. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But shan't we have to accept battle?&quot; remarked 
                Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall if everybody wants it; it can't be helped.... 
                But believe me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those 
                two: patience and time, they will do it all. But the advisers 
                n'entendent pas de cette oreille, voila le mal.* Some want a thing- 
                others don't. What's one to do?&quot; he asked, evidently expecting 
                an answer. &quot;Well, what do you want us to do?&quot; he repeated 
                and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look. &quot;I'll tell you 
                what to do,&quot; he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not 
                reply: &quot;I will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le 
                doute, mon cher,&quot; he paused, &quot;abstiens-toi&quot;*[2]- 
                he articulated the French proverb deliberately. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Don't see it that way, that's the trouble.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all 
                my heart I share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene 
                Highness, nor a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! 
                If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the 
                latter had left the room Kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went 
                on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame 
                de Genlis.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, 
                but after that interview with Kutuzov he went back to his regiment 
                reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man 
                to whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence 
                of all personal motive in that old man- in whom there seemed to 
                remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect 
                (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly 
                to contemplate the course of events- the more reassured he was 
                that everything would be as it should. &quot;He will not bring 
                in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew, &quot;but he will hear everything, remember 
                everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder 
                anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that 
                there is something stronger and more important than his own will- 
                the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp 
                their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from 
                meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something 
                else. And above all,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, &quot;one believes 
                in him because he's Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the 
                French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: 'What 
                they have brought us to!' and had a sob in it when he said he 
                would 'make them eat horseflesh!'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity 
                and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, 
                the popular choice of Kutuzov as commander in chief was received.</p>

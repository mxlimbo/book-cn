              <p> 　　 History examines the manifestations of man's free will in 
                connection with the external world in time and in dependence on 
                cause, that is, it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, 
                and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is 
                defined by those laws.</p>
              <p> 　　The recognition of man's free will as something capable of 
                influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, 
                is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving 
                the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy.</p>
              <p> 　　That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence 
                of laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a 
                single body moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton 
                are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly 
                bodies any longer exists. If any single action is due to free 
                will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any conception 
                of historical events.</p>
              <p> 　　For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one 
                end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of 
                which a consciousness of man's will in the present moves in space, 
                time, and dependence on cause.</p>
              <p> 　　The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, 
                the more evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and 
                define those laws is the problem of history.</p>
              <p> 　　From the standpoint from which the science of history now 
                regards its subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes 
                of events in man's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those 
                laws is impossible, for however man's free will may be restricted, 
                as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the 
                existence of law becomes impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, 
                that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can 
                we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, 
                and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery 
                of laws as its problem.</p>
              <p> 　　The search for these laws has long been begun and the new 
                methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out 
                simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which- ever dissecting 
                and dissecting the causes of phenomena- the old method of history 
                is moving.</p>
              <p> 　　All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving 
                at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons 
                the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration 
                of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception 
                of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common 
                to all unknown, infinitely small, elements.</p>
              <p> 　　In another form but along the same path of reflection the 
                other sciences have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law 
                of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property 
                of attraction; he said that all bodies from the largest to the 
                smallest have the property of attracting one another, that is, 
                leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the 
                bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies from the 
                infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by 
                the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they 
                seek for laws. History stands on the same path. And if history 
                has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and 
                of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of 
                individuals, it too, setting aside the conception of cause, should 
                seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal 
                elements of free will. </p>

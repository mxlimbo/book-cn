              <p> 　　The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September, 
                that is, till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city.</p>
              <p> 　　After Petya had joined Obolenski's regiment of Cossacks and 
                left for Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess 
                was seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at 
                the war, had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow 
                either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of 
                one of her acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first 
                time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and 
                wished to go herself to join Petya, or to get him an appointment 
                somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. 
                Petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he 
                was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas 
                was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his 
                last letter, in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting 
                with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when 
                she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. 
                After many consultations and conversations, the count at last 
                devised means to tranquillize her. He got Petya transferred from 
                Obolenski's regiment to Bezukhov's, which was in training near 
                Moscow. Though Petya would remain in the service, this transfer 
                would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one 
                of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for 
                her Petya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed 
                to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As 
                long as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that 
                she loved her first-born more than all her other children and 
                even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace 
                who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in the 
                house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed 
                Petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft 
                down was just beginning to show- when he was thrown amid those 
                big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something 
                and apparently finding pleasure in it- then his mother thought 
                she loved him more, much more, than all her other children. The 
                nearer the time came for Petya to return, the more uneasy grew 
                the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such 
                happiness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even 
                of her husband irritated her. &quot;What do I want with them? 
                I want no one but Petya,&quot; she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from 
                Nicholas. He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had 
                been sent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the 
                countess at ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became 
                the more anxious about Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs' 
                acquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade 
                the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would not 
                bear of leaving before her treasure, her adored Petya, returned. 
                On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness 
                with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old 
                officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping 
                him under her wing, Petya guessed her designs, and instinctively 
                fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her- might 
                &quot;become womanish&quot; as he termed it to himself- he treated 
                her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached 
                himself exclusively to Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly 
                brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.</p>
              <p> 　　Owing to the count's customary carelessness nothing was ready 
                for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts 
                that were to come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove 
                their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.</p>
              <p> 　　From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was 
                in a bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded 
                at Borodino were brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken 
                to various parts of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the 
                inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates. In spite 
                of Rostopchin's broadsheets, or because of them or independently 
                of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current 
                in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave 
                the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been 
                taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. 
                Some said there had been another battle after Borodino at which 
                the French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported 
                that the Russian army bad been destroyed. Some talked about the 
                Moscow militia which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the 
                Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had been forbidden 
                to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were 
                rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. 
                But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of 
                Fili, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been 
                held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt, 
                though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, 
                and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save 
                their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break 
                up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done 
                so. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he 
                must die immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens 
                the cap that is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued 
                its wonted life, though it knew that the time of its destruction 
                was near when the conditions of life to which its people were 
                accustomed to submit would be completely upset.</p>
              <p> 　　During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the 
                whole Rostov family was absorbed in various activities. The head 
                of the family, Count Ilya Rostov, continually drove about the 
                city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial 
                and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied 
                with everything, was constantly in pursuit of Petya who was always 
                running away from her, and was jealous of Natasha with whom he 
                spent all his time. Sonya alone directed the practical side of 
                matters by getting things packed. But of late Sonya had been particularly 
                sad and silent. Nicholas' letter in which he mentioned Princess 
                Mary had elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, 
                who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess 
                and Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was never pleased at Bolkonski's engagement to Natasha,&quot; 
                said the countess, &quot;but I always wanted Nicholas to marry 
                the princess, and had a presentiment that it would happen. What 
                a good thing it would be!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of 
                retrieving the Rostovs' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich 
                woman, and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter 
                for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, 
                she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing 
                and packing of their things and was busy for whole days. The count 
                and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya 
                and Natasha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were 
                generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day 
                long the house resounded with their running feet, their cries, 
                and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not 
                because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and 
                mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was 
                a cause for gaiety and laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits 
                because having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told 
                him) a fine young man, because he was at home, because he had 
                left Belaya Tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part 
                in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting 
                in a few days, and chiefly because Natasha, whose lead he always 
                followed, was in high spirits. Natasha was gay because she had 
                been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of 
                her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also happy 
                because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others 
                was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them 
                run freely- and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because 
                there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town 
                gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping- going 
                away somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, 
                and that is always exciting, especially to the young. </p>

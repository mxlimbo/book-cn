              <p> 　　On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevardino 
                Redoubt was fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by 
                either side, and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodino itself 
                took place.</p>
              <p> 　　Why and how were the battles of Shevardino and Borodino given 
                and accepted? Why was the battle of Borodino fought? There was 
                not the least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. 
                Its immediate result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, 
                that we were brought nearer to the destruction of Moscow- which 
                we feared more than anything in the world; and for the French 
                its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the 
                destruction of their whole army- which they feared more than anything 
                in the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and yet 
                Napoleon offered and Kutuzov accepted that battle.</p>
              <p> 　　If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem 
                that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen 
                hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a 
                quarter of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, 
                and it must have been equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting 
                battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would 
                certainly lose Moscow. For Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, 
                as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and 
                go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should 
                not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have fourteen, 
                I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged 
                thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.</p>
              <p> 　　Before the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to 
                the French was about as five to six, but after that battle it 
                was little more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand 
                against a hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more 
                than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd 
                and experienced Kutuzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who 
                was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter 
                of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more. 
                If it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying 
                Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, 
                there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon's historians 
                themselves tell us that from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, 
                knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the occupation 
                of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had seen 
                at Smolensk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, 
                and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements 
                of his wish to negotiate.</p>
              <p> 　　In giving and accepting battle at Borodino, Kutuzov acted 
                involuntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had 
                occurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of 
                the foresight and genius the generals who, of all the blind tools 
                of history were the most enslaved and involuntary.</p>
              <p> 　　The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the 
                heroes furnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still 
                unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories 
                of that kind are meaningless.</p>
              <p> 　　On the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the 
                preceding battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists 
                a definite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the 
                historians describe the affair as follows:</p>
              <p> 　　The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolensk sought 
                out for itself the best position for a general engagement and 
                found such a position at Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance 
                on the left of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost 
                at a right angle to it, from Borodino to Utitsa, at the very place 
                where the battle was fought.</p>
              <p> 　　In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was 
                set up on the Shevardino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, 
                we are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, 
                and, on the twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which 
                was in position on the field of Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone 
                who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the 
                contrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than 
                Borodino. They did not stop at any one of these positions because 
                Kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen, 
                because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed 
                itself strongly enough, and because Miloradovich had not yet arrived 
                with the militia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that 
                other positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position 
                at Borodino (the one where the battle was fought), far from being 
                strong, was no more a position than any other spot one might find 
                in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.</p>
              <p> 　　Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the 
                field of Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the 
                highroad (that is, the position on which the battle took place), 
                but never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think 
                that a battle might be fought there. This was shown first by the 
                fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth 
                and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were 
                not completed, and secondly, by the position of the Shevardino 
                Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position 
                where the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly fortified 
                than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six 
                thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the 
                twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe 
                the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle 
                was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevardino Redoubt 
                was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that 
                up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagration were convinced 
                that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, 
                and that Kutuzov himself in his report, written in hot haste after 
                the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the left flank 
                of the position. It was much later, when reports on the battle 
                of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary 
                statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a 
                commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that 
                the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post- whereas in reality 
                it was simply a fortified point on the left flank- and that the 
                battle of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position 
                previously selected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected 
                spot which was almost unentrenched.</p>
              <p> 　　The case was evidently this: a position was selected along 
                the river Kolocha- which crosses the highroad not at a right angle 
                but at an acute angle- so that the left flank was at Shevardino, 
                the right flank near the village of Novoe, and the center at Borodino 
                at the confluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voyna.</p>
              <p> 　　To anyone who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking 
                of how the battle was actually fought, this position, protected 
                by the river Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose 
                object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk 
                road to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, riding to Valuevo on the twenty-fourth, did not 
                see (as the history books say he did) the position of the Russians 
                from Utitsa to Borodino (he could not have seen that position 
                because it did not exist), nor did he see an advanced post of 
                the Russian army, but while pursuing the Russian rearguard he 
                came upon the left flank of the Russian position- at the Shevardino 
                Redoubt- and unexpectedly for the Russians moved his army across 
                the Kolocha. And the Russians, not having time to begin a general 
                engagement, withdrew their left wing from the position they had 
                intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been 
                foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other side 
                of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the 
                whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the 
                Russian side) and transferred it to the plain between Utitsa, 
                Semenovsk, and Borodino- a plain no more advantageous as a position 
                than any other plain in Russia- and there the whole battle of 
                the twenty-sixth of August took place.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth 
                to the Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack 
                on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would 
                have doubted that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of 
                our and the battle would have taken place where we expected it. 
                In that case we should probably have defended the Shevardino Redoubt- 
                our left flank- still more obstinately. We should have attacked 
                Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the engagement would 
                have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the position we intended 
                and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took place 
                in the evening after the retreat of our rea guard (that is, immediately 
                after the fight at Gridneva), and as the Russian commanders did 
                not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general engagement then 
                on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and chief action 
                of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the twenty-fourth, 
                and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.</p>
              <p> 　　After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves 
                on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our 
                left flank, and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench 
                it where it chanced to be.</p>
              <p> 　　Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended 
                by weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that 
                position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders- 
                not having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of 
                our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field 
                of the forthcoming battle from right to left- maintained their 
                extended position from the village of Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently 
                had to move their forces from right to left during the battle. 
                So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed 
                the entire French army launched against our left flank with but 
                half as many men. (Poniatowski's action against Utitsa, and Uvarov's 
                on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from 
                the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodino did 
                not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders' 
                mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the 
                Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle of 
                Borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with 
                forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a 
                result of the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, the Russians fought 
                the battle of Borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position, 
                with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say, 
                under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight 
                for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable 
                to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight.

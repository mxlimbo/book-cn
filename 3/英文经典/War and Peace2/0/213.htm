              <p> 　　From Gorki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge 
                which, when they had looked it from the hill, the officer had 
                pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows 
                of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across 
                that bridge into the village of Borodino and thence turned to 
                the left, passing an enormous number of troops and guns, and came 
                to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, 
                as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt, 
                or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to 
                it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to him 
                than any other spot on the plain of Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers 
                were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then 
                they rode downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten 
                down as if by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery 
                over the furrows of the plowed land, and reached some fleches* 
                which were still being dug. </p>
              <p> 　　*A kind of entrenchment. </p>
              <p> 　　At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the 
                Shevardino Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before 
                and where several horsemen could be descried. The officers said 
                that either Napoleon or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly 
                at this little group of horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, 
                trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was 
                Napoleon. At last those mounted men rode away from the mound and 
                disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began 
                explaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to 
                him, straining each faculty to understand the essential points 
                of the impending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental 
                capacity was inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of 
                it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, 
                suddenly said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't think this interests you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary it's very interesting!&quot; replied 
                Pierre not quite truthfully.</p>
              <p> 　　From the fleches they rode still farther to the left, along 
                a road winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the 
                middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, 
                scared by the tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that 
                it leaped along the road in front of them for some time, arousing 
                general attention and laughter, and only when several voices shouted 
                at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket. After 
                going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out 
                on a glade where troops of Tuchkov's corps were stationed to defend 
                the left flank.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great 
                deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders 
                of great military importance. In front of Tuchkov's troops was 
                some high ground not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized 
                this mistake, saying that it was madness to leave a height which 
                commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below 
                it. Some of the generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular 
                declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. 
                Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the 
                high ground. This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre's 
                doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters. Listening 
                to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the 
                troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their 
                opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand how 
                the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so 
                gross and palpable a blunder.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen 
                supposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed 
                position as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might 
                be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen 
                did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his 
                own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.

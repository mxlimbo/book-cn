              <p> 　　The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him 
                with hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which 
                he was taken. In their attitude toward him could still be felt 
                both uncertainty as to who he might be- perhaps a very important 
                person- and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict 
                with him.</p>
              <p> 　　But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt 
                that for the new guard- both officers and men- he was not as interesting 
                as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second 
                day did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat 
                the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder 
                and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving 
                a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, 
                arrested and detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. 
                If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only 
                his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and 
                the way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. 
                In spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested 
                suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was required by 
                an officer. <br>
                　　All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest 
                class and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, 
                more especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing 
                them making fun of him.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, 
                among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day 
                he was taken with the others to a house where a French general 
                with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen 
                with scarves on their arms. With the precision and definiteness 
                customary in addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude 
                human frailty, Pierre like the others was questioned as to who 
                he was, where he had been, with what object, and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left 
                the essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that 
                essence's being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel 
                through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to 
                flow so as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. 
                As soon as Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with 
                that aim, the channel was removed and the water could flow to 
                waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused always feel at 
                their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were put to 
                him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or 
                a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. 
                He knew he was in these men's power, that only by force had they 
                brought him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand 
                answers to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly 
                was to inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to 
                inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. 
                It was evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When 
                asked what he was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in 
                a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a 
                child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought the marauder? 
                Pierre answered that he &quot;was protecting a woman,&quot; and 
                that &quot;to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty 
                of every man; that...&quot; They interrupted him, for this was 
                not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where 
                witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see 
                what was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they 
                had not asked where he was going, but why he was found near the 
                fire? Who was he? they asked, repeating their first question, 
                which he had declined to answer. Again he replied that he could 
                not answer it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Put that down, that's bad... very bad,&quot; sternly 
                remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of 
                a merchant's house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through 
                the streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang 
                over the whole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not 
                then realize the significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked 
                at the fires with horror.</p>
              <p> 　　He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge 
                and during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, 
                that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might 
                come any day from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could 
                not learn from the soldiers. Evidently for them &quot;the marshal&quot; 
                represented a very high and rather mysterious power.</p>
              <p> 　　These first days, before the eighth of September when the 
                prisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest 
                of all for Pierre.</p>

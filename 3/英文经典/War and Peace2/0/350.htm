              <p> 　　When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess 
                was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental 
                exertion of playing patience, and so- though by force of habit 
                she greeted him with the words she always used when Pierre or 
                her son returned after an absence: &quot;High time, my dear, high 
                time! We were all weary of waiting for you. Well, thank God!&quot; 
                and received her presents with another customary remark: &quot;It's 
                not the gift that's precious, my dear, but that you give it to 
                me, an old woman...&quot;- yet it was evident that she was not 
                pleased by Pierre's arrival at that moment when it diverted her 
                attention from the unfinished game.</p>
              <p> 　　She finished her game of patience and only then examined the 
                presents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, 
                a bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it 
                and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count's portrait 
                on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. 
                The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she did not 
                want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait 
                and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,&quot; said 
                she as she always did. &quot;But best of all you have brought 
                yourself back- for I never saw anything like it, you ought to 
                give your wife a scolding! What are <br>
                we to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. 
                Doesn't see anything, doesn't remember anything,&quot; she went 
                on, repeating her usual phrases. &quot;Look, Anna Timofeevna,&quot; 
                she added to her companion, &quot;see what a box for cards my 
                son has brought us!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress 
                material.</p>
              <p> 　　Though Pierre, Natasha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denisov 
                had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the 
                old countess- not that anything was hidden from her, but because 
                she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they 
                begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer 
                inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told 
                her many times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married, 
                which she would again be unable to remember- yet they sat at tea 
                round the samovar in the drawing room from habit, and Pierre answered 
                the countess' questions as to whether Prince Vasili had aged and 
                whether Countess Mary Alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought 
                of them, and other matters that interested no one and to which 
                she herself was indifferent.</p>
              <p> 　　Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable, 
                continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the 
                family were assembled near the round tea table at which Sonya 
                presided beside the samovar. The children with their tutors and 
                governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the 
                next room. At tea all sat in their accustomed places: Nicholas 
                beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to 
                him; Milka, the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first Milka), 
                with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent 
                than ever, lay on the armchair beside him; Denisov, whose curly 
                hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half gray, sat beside 
                countess Mary with his general's tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat 
                between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he knew 
                might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He 
                told her of external social events and of the people who had formed 
                the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, 
                and distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered 
                about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears 
                of the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But to the old 
                countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious 
                and real society. Natasha saw by Pierre's animation that his visit 
                had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare 
                not say it before the old countess. Denisov, not being a member 
                of the family, did not understand Pierre's caution and being, 
                as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in Petersburg, 
                kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in the 
                Semenovsk regiment, then about Arakcheev, and then about the Bible 
                Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak 
                of these things, but Nicholas and Natasha always brought him back 
                to the health of Prince Ivan and Countess Mary Alexeevna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and all this idiocy- Gossner and Tatawinova?&quot; 
                Denisov asked. &quot;Is that weally still going on?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Going on?&quot; Pierre exclaimed. &quot;Why more than 
                ever! The Bible Society is the whole government now!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;What is that, mon cher ami?&quot; asked the countess, 
                who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being 
                angry after her meal. &quot;What are you saying about the government? 
                I don't understand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you know, Maman,&quot; Nicholas interposed, knowing 
                how to translate things into his mother's language, &quot;Prince 
                Alexander Golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has 
                great influence, they say.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Arakcheev and Golitsyn,&quot; incautiously remarked 
                Pierre, &quot;are now the whole government! And what a government! 
                They see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a 
                most estimable man. I used to meet him at Mary Antonovna's,&quot; 
                said the countess in an offended tone; and still more offended 
                that they all remained silent, she went on: &quot;Nowadays everyone 
                finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and what harm is there in 
                that?&quot; and she rose (everybody else got up too) and with 
                a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room.</p>
              <p> 　　The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds 
                of the children's voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently 
                some jolly excitement was going on there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Finished, finished!&quot; little Natasha's gleeful yell 
                rose above them all.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natasha 
                he never lost sight of) and smiled happily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's delightful music!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her stocking,&quot; 
                said Countess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I'll go and see,&quot; said Pierre, jumping up. 
                &quot;You know,&quot; he added, stopping at the door, &quot;why 
                I'm especially fond of that music? It is always the first thing 
                that tells me all is well. When I was driving here today, the 
                nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I entered 
                the anteroom I heard Andrusha's peals of laughter and that meant 
                that all was well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know! I know that feeling,&quot; said Nicholas. &quot;But 
                I mustn't go there- those stockings are to be a surprise for me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter 
                grew still louder.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, Anna Makarovna,&quot; Pierre's voice was heard 
                saying, &quot;come here into the middle of the room and at the 
                word of command, 'One, two,' and when I say 'three'... You stand 
                here, and you in my arms- well now! One, two!...&quot; said Pierre, 
                and a silence followed: &quot;three!&quot; and a rapturously breathless 
                cry of children's voices filled the room. &quot;Two, two!&quot; 
                they shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known 
                only to herself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the same time on 
                the same needles, and which, when they were ready, she always 
                triumphantly drew, one out of the other, in the children's presence.

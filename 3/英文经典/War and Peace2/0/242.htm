              <p> 　　On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the 
                Rostovs' house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all 
                the furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors 
                and pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, 
                and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants 
                and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily 
                on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, 
                some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.</p>
              <p> 　　The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants 
                who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another 
                in the yard and in the house. The count bad been out since morning. 
                The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil 
                and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress 
                on her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend 
                with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the 
                active army. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing 
                of the glass and china. Natasha was sitting on the floor of her 
                dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all 
                about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands 
                the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn 
                at her first Petersburg ball.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was 
                so busy, and several times that morning had tried to set to work, 
                but her heart was not in it, and she could not and did not know 
                how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might. 
                For a while she had stood beside Sonya while the china was being 
                packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up and went to her 
                room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing to 
                give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was 
                done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won't you, dear?&quot; 
                And when Dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha 
                sat down on the floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into 
                a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts 
                now. She was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids 
                in the next room (which was theirs) and by the sound of their 
                hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natasha got up and 
                looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full 
                of wounded men had stopped in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, 
                footmen, postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring 
                at the wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair 
                and holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.</p>
              <p> 　　The former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped 
                out of the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed 
                of bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay 
                inside. Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still 
                holding her handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper 
                was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then you have nobody in Moscow?&quot; she was saying. 
                &quot;You would be more comfortable somewhere in a house... in 
                ours, for instance... the family are leaving.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know if it would be allowed,&quot; replied the 
                officer in a weak voice. &quot;Here is our commanding officer... 
                ask him,&quot; and he pointed to a stout major who was walking 
                back along the street past the row of carts.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded 
                officer and at once went to meet the major.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May the wounded men stay in our house?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?&quot; said he, screwing 
                up his eyes and smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole 
                manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends 
                of her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some 
                reflection- as if considering in how far the thing was possible- 
                replied in the affirmative.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, why not? They may,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　With a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back 
                quickly to Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately 
                to the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They may. He says they may!&quot; whispered Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs' 
                yard, and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation 
                of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the 
                entrances of the houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently 
                pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine 
                of her life. She and Mavra Kuzminichna tried to get as many of 
                the wounded as possible into their yard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your Papa must be told, though,&quot; said Mavra Kuzminichna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one 
                day we can move into the drawing room. They can have all our half 
                of the house.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, young lady, you do take things into your 
                head! Even if we put them into the wing, the men's room, or the 
                nurse's room, we must ask permission.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I'll ask.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the 
                half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell 
                of vinegar and Hoffman's drops.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you asleep, Mamma?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what sleep-?&quot; said the countess, waking up 
                just as she was dropping into a doze.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma darling!&quot; said Natasha, kneeling by her mother 
                and bringing her face close to her mother's, &quot;I am sorry, 
                forgive me, I'll never do it again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna 
                has sent me: they have brought some wounded here- officers. Will 
                you let them come? They have nowhere to go. I knew you'd let them 
                come!&quot; she said quickly all in one breath.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand 
                anything about it,&quot; said the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I knew you'd give permission... so I'll tell them,&quot; 
                and, having kissed her mother, Natasha got up and went to the 
                door.</p>
              <p> 　　In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad 
                news.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We've stayed too long!&quot; said the count with involuntary 
                vexation. &quot;The Club is closed and the police are leaving.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa, is it all right- I've invited some of the wounded 
                into the house?&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course it is,&quot; he answered absently. &quot;That's 
                not the point. I beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to 
                help to pack, and tomorrow we must go, go, go!....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the 
                servants.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he 
                had heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, 
                and that though Rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would 
                sound a call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly 
                already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills 
                tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle there.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager, 
                excited face as he said this. She realized that if she said a 
                word about his not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the 
                thought of the impending engagement) he would say something about 
                men, honor, and the fatherland- something senseless, masculine, 
                and obstinate which there would be no contradicting, and her plans 
                would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before then 
                and take Petya with her as their protector and defender, she did 
                not answer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored 
                him with tears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. 
                With a woman's involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had 
                not shown any alarm, said that she would die of fright if they 
                did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she was now 
                afraid of everything.</p>

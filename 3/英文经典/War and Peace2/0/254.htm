              <p> 　　Toward nine o'clock in the morning, when the troops were already 
                moving through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions. 
                Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, 
                those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must 
                do.</p>
              <p> 　　The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, 
                and sat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.</p>
              <p> 　　In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator 
                that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under 
                his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable 
                every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. 
                While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator 
                in his frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of 
                the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts 
                move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises 
                and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion 
                is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own 
                enormous motion, the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, 
                and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and 
                a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostopchin felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.</p>
              <p> 　　The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, 
                went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed 
                the count that the horses were harnessed. They were both pale, 
                and the superintendent of police, after reporting that he had 
                executed the instructions he had received, informed the count 
                that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished 
                to see him.</p>
              <p> 　　Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to 
                his light, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took 
                hold of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from 
                which he had a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was 
                standing in front, flourishing his arm and saying something with 
                a stern look. The blood stained smith stood beside him with a 
                gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the closed 
                window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is my carriage ready?&quot; asked Rostopchin, stepping 
                back from the window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is, your excellency,&quot; replied the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostopchin went again to the balcony door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what do they want?&quot; he asked the superintendent 
                of police.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according 
                to your orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something 
                about treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency- 
                I hardly managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture 
                to suggest...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You may go. I don't need you to tell me what to do!&quot; 
                exclaimed Rostopchin angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what they have done with Russia! This is what 
                they have done with me!&quot; thought he, full of an irrepressible 
                fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what 
                was happening might be attributed. As often happens with passionate 
                people, he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object 
                on which to vent it. &quot;Here is that mob, the dregs of the 
                people,&quot; he thought as he gazed at the crowd: &quot;this 
                rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,&quot; 
                he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And 
                this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a 
                victim, something on which to vent his rage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is the carriage ready?&quot; he asked again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchagin? 
                He is waiting at the porch,&quot; said the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an unexpected 
                recollection.</p>
              <p> 　　And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the 
                balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, 
                and all eyes were raised to the count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good morning, lads!&quot; said the count briskly and 
                loudly. &quot;Thank you for coming. I'll come out to you in a 
                moment, but we must first settle with the villain. We must punish 
                the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed 
                the door behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. 
                &quot;He'll settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you 
                said the French... He'll show you what law is!&quot; the mob were 
                saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front 
                door, gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd 
                moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming 
                out there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if 
                seeking someone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he?&quot; he inquired. And as he spoke he saw 
                a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. 
                He had a long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, 
                was again covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in 
                a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once 
                been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers, over which were 
                pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak 
                legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his 
                eyes from the young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to 
                the bottom step of the porch. &quot;Put him there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to 
                the spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar 
                which chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and 
                that, sighed, and submissively folded before him his thin hands, 
                unused to work.</p>
              <p> 　　For several seconds while the young man was taking his place 
                on the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of 
                the people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, 
                groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.</p>
              <p> 　　While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step 
                Rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lads!&quot; said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. 
                &quot;This man, Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing 
                Moscow is perishing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood 
                in a submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His 
                emaciated young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung 
                down hopelessly. At the count's first words he raised it slowly 
                and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least 
                to meet his eye. But Rostopchin did not look at him. A vein in 
                the young man's long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue 
                behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.</p>
              <p> 　　All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered 
                more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he 
                smiled sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet 
                on the step.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he had gone 
                over to Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced 
                the Russian name, he has caused Moscow to perish,&quot; said Rostopchin 
                in a sharp, even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin 
                who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if 
                inflamed by the sight, he raised his arm and addressed the people, 
                almost shouting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer 
                to one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling 
                atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown, 
                uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing 
                in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, 
                all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining with all their 
                strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace 
                the Russian name!&quot; shouted Rostopchin. &quot;Cut him down. 
                I command it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's 
                voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count!&quot; exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice 
                of Vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, 
                &quot;Count! One God is above us both....&quot; He lifted his 
                head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood 
                and the color rapidly came and went in his face.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not finish what he wished to say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cut him down! I command it...&quot; shouted Rostopchin, 
                suddenly growing pale like Vereshchagin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Draw sabers!&quot; cried the dragoon officer, drawing 
                his own.</p>
              <p> 　　Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching 
                the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. 
                The tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted 
                arm, stood beside Vereshchagin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Saber him!&quot; the dragoon officer almost whispered.</p>
              <p> 　　And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with 
                fury, struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his 
                saber.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking 
                round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this 
                was done to him. A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through 
                the crowd. &quot;O Lord!&quot; exclaimed a sorrowful voice.</p>
              <p> 　　But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from 
                Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry 
                was fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, 
                that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had 
                begun and must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach 
                was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like 
                the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible 
                wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying 
                them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about 
                to repeat his blow. Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering 
                his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, 
                against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands 
                and, yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, 
                struggling crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. 
                And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those 
                who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the 
                crowd. It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate 
                the bleeding youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, 
                despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the 
                work that had been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, 
                and tearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the crowd 
                pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center 
                and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let 
                him go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold 
                Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture 
                serves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What- still alive?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed 
                to a long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his 
                prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each 
                one came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, 
                and astonishment pushed back again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he 
                be alive?&quot; voices in the crowd could be heard saying. &quot;Quite 
                a young fellow too... must have been a merchant's son. What men!... 
                and they say he's not the right one.... How not the right one?... 
                O Lord! And there's another has been beaten too- they say he's 
                nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren't they afraid of sinning?...&quot; 
                said the same mob now, looking with pained distress at the dead 
                body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its livid face 
                stained with blood and dust.</p>
              <p> 　　A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of 
                a corpse in his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons 
                to take it away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and 
                dragged it along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven 
                head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground. The 
                crowd shrank back from it.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed 
                in with savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly 
                turned pale and, instead of going to the back entrance where his 
                carriage awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not 
                knowing where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms 
                on the ground floor. The count's face was white and he could not 
                control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... 
                This way, please...&quot; said a trembling, frightened voice behind 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, 
                went in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his 
                caleche. The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even 
                there. He hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive 
                him to his country house in Sokolniki.</p>
              <p> 　　When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer 
                hear the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered 
                with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before 
                his subordinates. &quot;The mob is terrible- disgusting,&quot; 
                he said to himself in French. &quot;They are like wolves whom 
                nothing but flesh can appease.&quot; &quot;Count! One God is above 
                us both!&quot;- Vereshchagin's words suddenly recurred to him, 
                and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only 
                a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled disdainfully at 
                himself. &quot;I had other duties,&quot; thought he. &quot;The 
                people had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and 
                are perishing for the public good&quot;- and he began thinking 
                of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to 
                him, and of himself- not himself as Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin 
                (he fancied that Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing 
                himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the representative 
                of authority and of the Tsar. &quot;Had I been simply Theodore 
                Vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite different, 
                but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander 
                in chief.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and 
                no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin 
                grew physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became 
                physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be 
                mentally tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchin 
                was not a new one. Since the world began and men have killed one 
                another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow 
                man without comforting himself with this same idea. This idea 
                is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of other people.</p>
              <p> 　　To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, 
                but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare 
                lies. And Rostopchin now knew it.</p>
              <p> 　　Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, 
                but he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully 
                contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish 
                a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death,&quot; 
                thought Rostopchin (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchagin 
                to hard labor), &quot;he was a traitor and a spy. I could not 
                let him go unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one 
                stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim and at the same 
                time punished a miscreant.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having reached his country house and begun to give orders 
                about domestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.</p>
              <p> 　　Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across 
                the Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but 
                considering what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge 
                where he had heard that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally 
                preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address 
                to Kutuzov for his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier 
                feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would 
                follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as 
                Rostopchin regarded it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning 
                beforehand what he would say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin turned angrily 
                in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side.</p>
              <p> 　　The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in 
                front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some 
                people in white and others like them walking singly across the 
                field shouting and gesticulating.</p>
              <p> 　　One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin's 
                carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons 
                looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics 
                and especially at the one running toward them.</p>
              <p> 　　Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering 
                dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze 
                fixed on Rostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse voice and 
                making signs to him to stop. The lunatic's solemn, gloomy face 
                was thin and yellow, with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His 
                black, agate pupils with saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly 
                near the lower eyelids.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop! Pull up, I tell you!&quot; he cried in a piercing 
                voice, and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic 
                intonations and gestures.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from 
                the dead. They stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall 
                rise... shall rise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God 
                will be overthrown... Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish 
                it!&quot; he cried, raising his voice higher and higher.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the 
                crowd closed in on Vereshchagin. He turned away. &quot;Go fas... 
                faster!&quot; he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The 
                caleche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw 
                it, but for a long time Count Rostopchin still heard the insane 
                despairing screams growing fainter in the distance, while his 
                eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened, bloodstained 
                face of &quot;the traitor&quot; in the fur-lined coat.</p>
              <p> 　　Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt 
                that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now 
                he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would 
                not pass with time, but that the terrible memory would, on the 
                contrary, dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to 
                the end of his life. He seemed still to hear the sound of his 
                own words: &quot;Cut him down! I command it....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident 
                I said them.... I need not have said them,&quot; he thought. &quot;And 
                then nothing would have happened.&quot; He saw the frightened 
                and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow, the 
                look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the fur-lined coat 
                had turned upon him. &quot;But I did not do it for my own sake. 
                I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public 
                welfare,&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　Troops were still crowding at the Yauza bridge. It was hot. 
                Kutuzov, dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying 
                with his whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A 
                man in a general's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov 
                and said something in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told 
                Kutuzov that he had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more 
                and only the army remained.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Things would have been different if your Serene Highness 
                had not told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another 
                battle; all this would not have happened,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if, not grasping what was 
                said to him, he was trying to read something peculiar written 
                at that moment on the face of the man addressing him. Rostopchin 
                grew confused and became silent. Kutuzov slightly shook his head 
                and not taking his penetrating gaze from Rostopchin's face muttered 
                softly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different 
                when he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing 
                them to be meaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and 
                hastily left him. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, 
                the proud Count Rostopchin, took up a Cossack whip and went to 
                the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that 
                blocked the way.</p>

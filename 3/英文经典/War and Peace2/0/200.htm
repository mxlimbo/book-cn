              <p> 　　After her father's funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in 
                her room and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to 
                say that Alpatych was asking for orders about their departure. 
                (This was before his talk with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself 
                on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the 
                closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be 
                left in peace.</p>
              <p> 　　The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. 
                She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons 
                of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and 
                her confused thoughts were centered on one subject- the irrevocability 
                of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, 
                but which had shown itself during her father's illness. She wished 
                to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state of 
                mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that position.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting 
                rays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part 
                of the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The 
                flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, 
                smoothed her hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily 
                inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone 
                and no one will hinder you,&quot; she said to herself, and sinking 
                into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill.</p>
              <p> 　　Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the 
                garden and kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne in a black dress and weepers. She softly approached 
                Princess Mary, sighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. 
                The princess looked up at her. All their former disharmony and 
                her own jealousy recurred to her mind. But she remembered too 
                how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could 
                not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches 
                Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. &quot;Besides, is 
                it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?&quot; 
                she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of 
                Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, 
                but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house. She 
                felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle 
                inquiry. Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and 
                kissed that hand, speaking of the princess' sorrow and making 
                herself a partner in it. She said her only consolation was the 
                fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow, that all 
                the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great 
                grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone, 
                and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The 
                princess heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking 
                up at her and listening to the sound of her voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,&quot; 
                said Mademoiselle Bourienne after a pause. &quot;I understand 
                that you could not, and cannot, think of yourself, but with my 
                love for you I must do so.... Has Alpatych been to you? Has he 
                spoken to you of going away?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was 
                to go or where to. &quot;Is it possible to plan or think of anything 
                now? Is it not all the same?&quot; she thought, and did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, chere Marie,&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                &quot;that we are in danger- are surrounded by the French. It 
                would be dangerous to move now. If we go we are almost sure to 
                be taken prisoners, and God knows...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding 
                what she was talking about.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me 
                now,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course I would on no account wish 
                to go away from him.... Alpatych did say something about going.... 
                Speak to him; I can do nothing, nothing, and don't want to....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to 
                get away tomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay 
                here,&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne. &quot;Because, you will 
                agree, chere Marie, to fall into the hands of the soldiers or 
                of riotous peasants would be terrible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation 
                (not printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau's, telling 
                people not to leave their homes and that the French authorities 
                would afford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think it would be best to appeal to that general,&quot; 
                she continued, &quot;and and am sure that all due respect would 
                be shown you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver 
                with stifled sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From whom did you get this?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,&quot; 
                replied Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window 
                and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been 
                Prince Andrew's study.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dunyasha, send Alpatych, or Dronushka, or somebody to 
                me!&quot; she said, &quot;and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not 
                to come to me,&quot; she added, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne's 
                voice. &quot;We must go at once, at once!&quot; she said, appalled 
                at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the 
                French! That I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, asked 
                General Rameau for protection and accepted his favor!&quot; This 
                idea horrified her, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush 
                of anger and pride as she had never experienced before. All that 
                was distressing, and especially all that was humiliating, in her 
                position rose vividly to her mind. &quot;They, the French, would 
                settle in this house: M. le General Rameau would occupy Prince 
                Andrew's study and amuse himself by looking through and reading 
                his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors 
                of Bogucharovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, 
                the soldiers would violate my father's newly dug grave to steal 
                his crosses and stars, they would tell me of their victories over 
                the Russians, and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...&quot; 
                thought Princess Mary, not thinking her own thoughts but feeling 
                bound to think like her father and her brother. For herself she 
                did not care where she remained or what happened to her, but she 
                felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince 
                Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their 
                feelings. What they would have said and what they would have done 
                she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew's study, 
                trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her 
                position.</p>
              <p> 　　The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by 
                her father's death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously 
                unknown force and took possession of her.</p>
              <p> 　　Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael 
                Ivanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron. Dunyasha, the nurse, and 
                the other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne's 
                statement was correct. Alpatych was not at home, he had gone to 
                the police. Neither could the architect Michael Ivanovich, who 
                on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary 
                anything. With just the same smile of agreement with which for 
                fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince 
                without expressing views of his own, he now replied to Princess 
                Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his answers. 
                The old valet Tikhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the 
                stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: &quot;Yes, Princess&quot; 
                to all Princess Mary's questions and hardly refrained from sobbing 
                as he looked at her.</p>
              <p> 　　At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with 
                a deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front 
                of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dronushka,&quot; she said, regarding as a sure friend 
                this Dronushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread 
                from his visit to the fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly 
                offer it to her, &quot;Dronushka, now since our misfortune...&quot; 
                she began, but could not go on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are all in God's hands,&quot; said he, with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　They were silent for a while.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dronushka, Alpatych has gone off somewhere and I have 
                no one to turn to. Is true, as they tell me, that I can't even 
                go away?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why shouldn't you go away, your excellency? You can 
                go,&quot; said Dron.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. 
                Dear friend, I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! 
                I want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: 
                &quot;There are no horses; I told Yakov Alpatych so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are there none?&quot; asked the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all God's scourge,&quot; said Dron. &quot;What 
                horses we had have been taken for the army or have died- this 
                is such a year! It's not a case of feeding horses- we may die 
                of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three days without eating. 
                We've nothing, we've been ruined.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?&quot; she 
                asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They're dying of hunger,&quot; said Dron. &quot;It's 
                not a case of carting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why didn't you tell me, Dronushka? Isn't it possible 
                to help them? I'll do all I can....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when 
                such sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and 
                poor, and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had 
                heard vaguely that there was such a thing as &quot;landlord's 
                corn&quot; which was sometimes given to the peasants. She also 
                knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help 
                the peasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in 
                speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give. 
                She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her without 
                scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the 
                peasants' needs and what there was in Bogucharovo that belonged 
                to the landlord.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But we have grain belonging to my brother?&quot; she 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The landlord's grain is all safe,&quot; replied Dron 
                proudly. &quot;Our prince did not order it to be sold.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; 
                I give you leave in my brother's name,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute 
                it all. I give this order in my brother's name; and tell them 
                that what is ours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell 
                them so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot; Dron looked intently at the princess while she was 
                speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Discharge me, little mother, for God's sake! Order the 
                keys to be taken from me,&quot; said he. &quot;I have served twenty-three 
                years and have done no wrong. Discharge me, for God's sake!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or 
                why he was asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never 
                doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for 
                him and for the peasants. </p>

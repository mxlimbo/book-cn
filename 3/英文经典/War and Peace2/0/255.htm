              <p> 　　Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat's troops were entering 
                Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and 
                behind them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous 
                suite.</p>
              <p> 　　About the middle of the Arbat Street, near the Church of the 
                Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from 
                the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had 
                found the citadel, le Kremlin.</p>
              <p> 　　Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in 
                Moscow. They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, 
                long-haired commander dressed up in feathers and gold.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that their Tsar himself? He's not bad!&quot; low 
                voices could be heard saying.</p>
              <p> 　　An interpreter rode up to the group.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take off your cap... your caps!&quot; These words went 
                from one to another in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an 
                old porter and asked if it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, 
                listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not 
                realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand 
                what was being said to him and slipped behind the others.</p>
              <p> 　　Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where 
                the Russian army was. One of the Russians understood what was 
                asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter. 
                A French officer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode 
                up to Murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been 
                barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good!&quot; said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen 
                in his suite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire 
                at the gates.</p>
              <p> 　　The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat 
                and advanced up the Arbat. When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka 
                Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers 
                superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin 
                through field glasses.</p>
              <p> 　　The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this 
                sound troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. 
                A few infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens 
                had been put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the 
                gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it. A general 
                who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to 
                the officer, and the latter ran back again with his men.</p>
              <p> 　　The sound of three more shots came from the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　One shot struck a French soldier's foot, and from behind the 
                screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly 
                as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on 
                the faces of the French general, officers, and men changed to 
                one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. 
                To all of them from the marshal to the least soldier, that place 
                was not the Vozdvizhenka, Mokhavaya, or Kutafyev Street, nor the 
                Troitsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a new battlefield 
                which would probably prove sanguinary. And all made ready for 
                that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The guns were advanced, 
                the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks, and an officer 
                gave the word &quot;Fire!&quot; This was followed by two whistling 
                sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against 
                the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and 
                two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.</p>
              <p> 　　A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over 
                the stone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange 
                sound above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls 
                and circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. 
                Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway 
                and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in 
                a peasant's coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French. 
                &quot;Fire!&quot; repeated the officer once more, and the reports 
                of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. 
                The gate again hidden by smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry 
                soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay 
                three wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away 
                at the foot of the wall, toward the Znamenka.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Clear that away!&quot; said the officer, pointing to 
                the beams and the corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching 
                the wounded, threw the corpses over the parapet.</p>
              <p> 　　Who these men were nobody knew. &quot;Clear that away!&quot; 
                was all that was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet 
                and removed later on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates 
                a few eloquent lines to their memory: &quot;These wretches had 
                occupied the sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns 
                from the arsenal, and fired&quot; (the wretches) &quot;at the 
                French. Some of them were sabered and the Kremlin was purged of 
                their presence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French 
                entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate 
                Square. Out of the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw 
                chairs into the Square for fuel and kindled fires there.</p>
              <p> 　　Other detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped 
                along the Moroseyka, the Lubyanka, and Pokrovka Streets. Others 
                quartered themselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the Nikolski, and 
                the Tverskoy Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, 
                the French were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in 
                towns but lived in it as in a camp.</p>
              <p> 　　Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third 
                of their original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching 
                order. It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing 
                army. But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed 
                into their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various 
                regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, 
                the army was lost forever and there came into being something 
                nondescript, neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known 
                as marauders. When five weeks later these same men left Moscow, 
                they no longer formed an army. They were a mob of marauders, each 
                carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or 
                useful. The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer, 
                as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired. 
                Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, 
                and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for 
                fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the French 
                when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried 
                their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was 
                as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw 
                and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered 
                a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military 
                uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, 
                laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms 
                similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking 
                or breaking open coach house and stable doors, lighting fires 
                in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, 
                and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. 
                There were many such men both in the shops and houses- but there 
                was no army.</p>
              <p> 　　Order after order was issued by the French commanders that 
                day forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding 
                any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing 
                a roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures 
                the men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over 
                the wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. 
                As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a 
                barren field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably 
                as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse 
                all over the wealthy city.</p>
              <p> 　　No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers- like water 
                percolating through sand- spread irresistibly through the city 
                in all directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. 
                The cavalry, on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned 
                and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, 
                went on, all the same, to the next house which seemed to them 
                better. Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their 
                names on them, and quarreled and even fought with other companies 
                for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers 
                ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that everything 
                had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be 
                had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers 
                and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage 
                Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked 
                there to select caleches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants 
                who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, 
                hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered. There 
                were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around 
                the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored 
                and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be 
                found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When 
                water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water 
                disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the 
                famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires 
                and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy 
                city. </p>
              <p> 　　The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce 
                de Rostopchine,* the Russians to the barbarity of the French. 
                In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to 
                explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any 
                group of people, responsible for it. Moscow was burned because 
                it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood 
                was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or had not, 
                a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted Moscow had 
                to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which 
                sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood, 
                where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house 
                owners are in residence and a police force is present, cannot 
                help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied 
                by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs 
                in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals twice a day. In 
                peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages 
                of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately 
                increases. How much then must the probability of fire be increased 
                in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are quartered. 
                &quot;Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine&quot; and the barbarity 
                of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set 
                on fire by the soldiers' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by 
                the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not 
                own. Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for 
                no one had any reason to burn the houses- in any case a troublesome 
                and dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, 
                for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*To Rostopchin's ferocious patriotism. </p>
              <p> 　　However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin's 
                ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or 
                later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, 
                it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct 
                cause of the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, 
                or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers 
                are allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned 
                by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned 
                it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by 
                the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other 
                towns, simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not 
                welcome the French with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys 
                of the city.</p>

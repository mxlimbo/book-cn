              <p> 　　 From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, 
                the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the 
                earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of 
                the ancients. By disproving that law it might have been possible 
                to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies, but 
                without disproving it, it would seem impossible to continue studying 
                the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after the discovery of the law 
                of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long 
                time.</p>
              <p> 　　From the time the first person said and proved that the number 
                of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that 
                this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical 
                and economic conditions, and that certain relations of population 
                to soil produce migrations of peoples, the foundations on which 
                history had been built were destroyed in their essence.</p>
              <p> 　　By refuting these new laws the former view of history might 
                have been retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible 
                to continue studying historic events as the results of man's free 
                will. For if a certain mode of government was established or certain 
                migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such 
                geographic, ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free 
                will of those individuals who appear to us to have established 
                that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer 
                be regarded as the cause.</p>
              <p> 　　And yet the former history continues to be studied side by 
                side with the laws of statistics, geography, political economy, 
                comparative philology, and geology, which directly contradict 
                its assumptions.</p>
              <p> 　　The struggle between the old views and the new was long and 
                stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on 
                guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation. 
                But when truth conquered, theology established itself just as 
                firmly on the new foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding 
                between the old and the new conception of history, and theology 
                in the same way stands on guard for the old view, and accuses 
                the new view of subverting revelation.</p>
              <p> 　　In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle 
                provokes passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear 
                and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through 
                the ages, on the other is the passion for destruction.</p>
              <p> 　　To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical 
                philosophy, it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would 
                destroy faith in God, in the creation of the firmament, and in 
                the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. To the defenders of the 
                laws of Copernicus and Newton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed 
                that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, and he utilized 
                the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion.</p>
              <p> 　　Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of 
                inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good 
                and evil, and all the institutions of state and church that have 
                been built up on those conceptions.</p>
              <p> 　　So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of 
                the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against 
                religion, though the law of inevitability in history, like the 
                law of Copernicus in astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens 
                the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are 
                erected.</p>
              <p> 　　As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of 
                history now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition 
                or nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure 
                of visible phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of 
                the earth, in history it is the independence of personality- free 
                will.</p>
              <p> 　　As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion 
                of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the 
                earth's fixity and of the motion of the planets, so in history 
                the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to 
                the laws of space, time, and cause lies in renouncing the direct 
                feeling of the independence of one's own personality. But as in 
                astronomy the new view said: &quot;It is true that we do not feel 
                the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility we 
                arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do 
                not feel) we arrive at laws,&quot; so also in history the new 
                view says: &quot;It is true that we are not conscious of our dependence, 
                but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity, while by 
                admitting our dependence on the external world, on time, and on 
                cause, we arrive at laws.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness 
                of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we 
                did not feel; in the present case it is similarly necessary to 
                renounce a freedom that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence 
                of which we are not conscious.</p>

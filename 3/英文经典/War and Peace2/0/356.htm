              <p> 　　 A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: &quot;What moves it?&quot; 
                A peasant says the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive 
                moves because its wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause 
                of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away.</p>
              <p> 　　The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. 
                To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is 
                no devil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that 
                it is not the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only 
                then, as a result of the contradiction, will they see that they 
                are both wrong. But the man who says that the movement of the 
                wheels is the cause refutes himself, for having once begun to 
                analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go 
                round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement 
                of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he has 
                no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains 
                the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back 
                has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has 
                taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered 
                that as an explanation.</p>
              <p> 　　The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive 
                is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.</p>
              <p> 　　The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples 
                is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of 
                the peoples.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces 
                of different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement 
                observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, 
                as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force 
                resulting from several other forces, like the movement of the 
                wheels; others again as an intellectual influence, like the smoke 
                that is blown away.</p>
              <p> 　　So long as histories are written of separate individuals, 
                whether Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the 
                histories of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, 
                it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without 
                the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity 
                toward a certain end. And the only such conception known to historians 
                is that of power.</p>
              <p> 　　This conception is the one handle by means of which the material 
                of history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone 
                who breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some 
                other method of treating historical material, merely deprives 
                himself of the one possible way of dealing with it. The necessity 
                of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events 
                is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians 
                of culture themselves, for they professedly reject that conception 
                but inevitably have recourse to it at every step.</p>
              <p> 　　In dealing with humanity's inquiry, the science of history 
                up to now is like money in circulation- paper money and coin. 
                The biographies and special national histories are like paper 
                money. They can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose 
                without harm to anyone and even advantageously, as long as no 
                one asks what is the security behind them. You need only forget 
                to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and such histories 
                as Thiers' will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps 
                even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real 
                value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, 
                too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it 
                for gold, so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories 
                arise either because too many of them are written or because in 
                his simplicity of heart someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon 
                do this?- that is, wants to exchange the current paper money for 
                the real gold of actual comprehension.</p>
              <p> 　　The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture 
                are like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide 
                to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific 
                gravity of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do 
                no more than that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody 
                is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely 
                jingle. As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for 
                exchange but also for use, so universal historians will be valuable 
                only when they can reply to history's essential question: what 
                is power? The universal historians give contradictory replies 
                to that question, while the historians of culture evade it and 
                answer something quite different. And as counters of imitation 
                gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept 
                them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of gold, 
                so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering 
                humanity's essential question, serve as currency for some purposes 
                of their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers 
                who have a taste for what they call &quot;serious reading.&quot;

              <p> 　　From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by 
                the enemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded 
                was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald 
                Hills. Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. 
                Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally 
                veiled the sun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the 
                sun set in reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed 
                the earth. The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. 
                The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no 
                food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and in the forests 
                while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the road, 
                the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such 
                freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; 
                the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than 
                six inches deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery 
                and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that 
                rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep 
                in that soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. 
                Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the 
                rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, 
                ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the 
                men and beasts as they moved along that road. The higher the sun 
                rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and through the screen 
                of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the 
                sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky. 
                There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere. 
                They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths. 
                When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells 
                and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management 
                of that regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of 
                receiving and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolensk 
                and its abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling 
                of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was 
                entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate 
                and kind to his men and officers. In the regiment they called 
                him &quot;our prince,&quot; were proud of him and loved him. But 
                he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Timokhin 
                and the like- people quite new to him, belonging to a different 
                world and who could not know and understand his past. As soon 
                as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff, 
                he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. 
                Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him, 
                and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself 
                to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.</p>
              <p> 　　In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy 
                light to Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk 
                on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should 
                have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee 
                to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills 
                which he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his 
                regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely 
                apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received 
                news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and 
                though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew 
                with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that 
                he must ride there.</p>
              <p> 　　He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment 
                on the march, rode to his father's estate where he had been born 
                and spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used 
                always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen 
                or beat it with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there 
                was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf, torn from 
                its place and half submerged, was floating on its side in the 
                middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper's lodge. No one at the 
                stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open. Grass 
                had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and horses and 
                calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode up 
                to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the 
                trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called 
                for Taras the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round 
                the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that 
                the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees 
                had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew 
                in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green 
                garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.</p>
              <p> 　　He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was 
                sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and 
                beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered 
                branch of a magnolia.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old 
                garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were 
                wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters 
                were all closed, except at one window which was open. A little 
                serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alpatych, 
                having sent his family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting 
                indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince 
                Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, 
                buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word began 
                weeping and kissing Prince Andrew's knee.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began 
                to report on the position of affairs. Everything precious and 
                valuable had been removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quarters of 
                grain had also been carted away. The hay and the spring corn, 
                of which Alpatych said there had been a remarkable crop that year, 
                had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still 
                green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too had gone to 
                Bogucharovo, only a few remained.</p>
              <p> 　　Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When did my father and sister leave?&quot; meaning when 
                did they leave for Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych, understanding the question to refer to their departure 
                for Bogucharovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and 
                again went into details concerning the estate management, asking 
                for instructions.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a 
                receipt for them? We have still six hundred quarters left,&quot; 
                he inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What am I to say to him?&quot; thought Prince Andrew, 
                looking down on the old man's bald head shining in the sun and 
                seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself 
                understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them 
                to allay his grief.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, let them have it,&quot; replied Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you noticed some disorder in the garden,&quot; said 
                Alpatych, &quot;it was impossible to prevent it. Three regiments 
                have been here and spent the night, dragoons mostly. I took down 
                the name and rank of their commanding officer, to hand in a complaint 
                about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here 
                if the enemy occupies the place?&quot; asked Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, 
                and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is my refuge! His will be done!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the 
                meadow toward the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, good-by!&quot; said Prince Andrew, bending over 
                to Alpatych. &quot;You must go away too, take away what you can 
                and tell the serfs to go to the Ryazan estate or to the one near 
                Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and burst into sobs. 
                Gently disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode 
                down the avenue at a gallop.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like 
                a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping 
                the last on which he was making the bast shoe, and two little 
                girls, running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts 
                plums they had plucked from the trees there, came upon Prince 
                Andrew. On seeing the young master, the elder one frightened look 
                clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind 
                a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green plums they had 
                dropped.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to 
                let them see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the 
                pretty frightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and 
                yet felt an irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort 
                and relief came over him when, seeing these girls, he realized 
                the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his 
                own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently 
                these girls passionately desired one thing- to carry away and 
                eat those green plums without being caught- and Prince Andrew 
                shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He could 
                not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past, 
                they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their 
                shrill little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little 
                sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow 
                grass.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off 
                the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not 
                far from Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook 
                his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond. 
                It was past one o'clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, 
                burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat. 
                The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came 
                from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the 
                dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond. 
                He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and 
                he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks 
                and laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more 
                than a foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked 
                white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, 
                who were splashing about in it. All this naked white human flesh, 
                laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like 
                carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment 
                in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic.</p>
              <p> 　　One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince 
                Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed 
                himself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the 
                water; another, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always 
                shaggy, stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling 
                his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured 
                the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists. There 
                were sounds of men slapping one another, yelling, and puffing.</p>
              <p> 　　Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there 
                was healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timokhin, with 
                his red little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a 
                towel, felt confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind 
                to address him nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't you like to?&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's dirty,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll clear it out for you in a minute,&quot; said Timokhin, 
                and, still undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The prince wants to bathe.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What prince? Ours?&quot; said many voices, and the men 
                were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop 
                them. He decided that he would rather himself with water in the 
                barn.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!&quot; he thought, and 
                he looked at his own naked body and shuddered, not from cold but 
                from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand, 
                aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing 
                about in the dirty pond. </p>
              <p> 　　On the seventh of August Prince Bagration wrote as follows 
                from his quarters at Mikhaylovna on the Smolensk road: </p>
              <p> 　　Dear Count Alexis Andreevich- (He was writing to Arakcheev 
                but knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore 
                weighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)</p>
              <p> 　　I expect the Minister [Barclay de Tolly] has already reported 
                the abandonment of Smolensk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, 
                and the whole army is in despair that this most important place 
                has been wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally 
                most urgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce 
                him to consent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in 
                such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but 
                could not have taken Smolensk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, 
                as never before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at 
                bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold 
                out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our 
                army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If 
                he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps 
                about four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were 
                they ten thousand, that's war! But the enemy has lost masses...</p>
              <p> 　　What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? 
                They would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had 
                no water for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, 
                but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. 
                We cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to 
                Moscow...</p>
              <p> 　　There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid 
                that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane 
                retreats! You would set all Russia against you and every one of 
                us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this- 
                we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men 
                able to stand...</p>
              <p> 　　One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister 
                may perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not 
                merely bad but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of 
                our whole country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive 
                my writing boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the 
                conclusion of a peace, and that the Minister should command the 
                army, does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. 
                So I write you frankly: call out the militia. For the Minister 
                is leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly 
                way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp 
                Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon's man than ours, and 
                he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil to him 
                but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is 
                painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only 
                I am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such 
                as he. Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and 
                left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we 
                attacked this would not have happened. Tell me, for God's sake, 
                what will Russia, our mother Russia, say to our being so frightened, 
                and why are we abandoning our good and gallant Fatherland to such 
                rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our 
                subjects? What are we scared at and of whom are we afraid? I am 
                not to blame that the Minister is vacillating, a coward, dense, 
                dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army bewails it 
                and calls down curses upon him...</p>

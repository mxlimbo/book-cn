              <p> 　　It is natural for us who were not living in those days to 
                imagine that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants 
                were ficeing to distant provinces, and one levy after another 
                was being raised for the defense of the fatherland, all Russians 
                from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing 
                themselves, saving their fatherland, or weeping over its downfall. 
                The tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak 
                only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, 
                and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really so. It 
                appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest 
                of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that 
                people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment 
                so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent 
                the public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the 
                people at that time paid no attention to the general progress 
                of events but were guided only by their private interests, and 
                they were the very people whose activities at that period were 
                most useful.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who tried to understand the general course of events 
                and to take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the 
                most useless members of society, they saw everything upside down, 
                and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless 
                and foolish- like Pierre's and Mamonov's regiments which looted 
                Russian villages, and the lint the young ladies prepared and that 
                never reached the wounded, and so on. Even those, fond of intellectual 
                talk and of expressing their feelings, who discussed Russia's 
                position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation 
                either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation 
                and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could 
                possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule forbidding 
                us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. 
                Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in 
                an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries 
                to realize it his efforts are fruitless.</p>
              <p> 　　The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking 
                place in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In 
                Petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, 
                and gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient 
                capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army 
                which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of 
                Moscow, and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one 
                swore to be avenged on the French, but they thought about their 
                next pay, their next quarters, of Matreshka the vivandiere, and 
                like matters.</p>
              <p> 　　As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostov 
                took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, 
                but did so casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he 
                therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair 
                and without dismally racking his brains over it. Had he been asked 
                what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have said that 
                it was not his business to think about it, that Kutuzov and others 
                were there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the regiments 
                were to be made up to their full strength, that fighting would 
                probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being so it 
                was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple 
                of years' time.</p>
              <p> 　　As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he 
                was being sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not 
                only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the 
                coming battle, but with the greatest pleasure- which he did not 
                conceal and which his comrades fully understood.</p>
              <p> 　　A few days before the battle of Borodino, Nicholas received 
                the necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars 
                on in advance, he set out with post horses for Voronezh.</p>
              <p> 　　Only a man who has experienced it- that is, has passed some 
                months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war- can 
                understand the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the 
                region covered by the army's foraging operations, provision trains, 
                and hospitals. When- free from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy 
                traces of a camp- he saw villages with peasants and peasant women, 
                gentlemen's country houses, fields where cattle were grazing, 
                posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them, he rejoiced as 
                though seeing all this for the first time. What for a long while 
                specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young and 
                healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women, 
                too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should 
                joke with them.</p>
              <p> 　　In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel 
                in Voronezh, ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, 
                and next day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he 
                had not worn for a long time, went to present himself to the authorities.</p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old 
                man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and 
                rank. He received Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically 
                military) and questioned him with an important air, as if considering 
                the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving 
                with full right to do so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that 
                this merely amused him.</p>
              <p> 　　From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. 
                The governor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. 
                He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, 
                recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner 
                fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses, and promised 
                to assist him in every way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are Count Ilya Rostov's son? My wife was a great 
                friend of your mother's. We are at home on Thursdays- today is 
                Thursday, so please come and see us quite informally,&quot; said 
                the governor, taking leave of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Immediately on leaving the governor's, Nicholas hired post 
                horses and, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove 
                at a gallop to the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the 
                stud. Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first 
                part of his stay in Voronezh and, as usually happens when a man 
                is in a pleasant state of mind, everything went well and easily.</p>
              <p> 　　The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old 
                cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some 
                century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery 
                where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.</p>
              <p> 　　In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions 
                for six thousand rubles- to serve, as he said, as samples of his 
                remounts. After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian 
                wine, Nicholas- having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with 
                whom he was already on the friendliest terms- galloped back over 
                abominable roads, in the brightest frame of mind, continually 
                urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor's party.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented 
                himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor's rather late, but with 
                the phrase &quot;better late than never&quot; on his lips.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone 
                knew that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise 
                on the clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone 
                had come as to a ball.</p>
              <p> 　　Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with 
                this difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence 
                of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in 
                everything that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness 
                was noticeable, an &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound- who cares?&quot; 
                spirit, and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the 
                weather and mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, 
                and Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　The society gathered together at the governor's was the best 
                in Voronezh.</p>
              <p> 　　There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas' Moscow 
                acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with 
                the cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured 
                and well-bred Count Rostov. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, 
                an officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence 
                of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. 
                The Italian was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, 
                it seemed to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same 
                light, and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing 
                around him a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the 
                words &quot;better late than never&quot; and heard them repeated 
                several times by others, people clustered around him; all eyes 
                turned on him, and he felt at once that he had entered into his 
                proper position in the province- that of a universal favorite: 
                a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so after his long 
                privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the landowner's 
                snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and here 
                too at the governor's party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) 
                an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried, 
                impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with 
                him and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to 
                get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled 
                down. Among these was the governor's wife herself, who welcomed 
                Rostov as a near relative and called him &quot;Nicholas.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise, 
                and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the 
                provincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner 
                of dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather 
                surprised at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced 
                like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very 
                free and easy manner improper and in bad form, but here he felt 
                it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual, 
                something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the 
                capital though new to them in the provinces.</p>
              <p> 　　All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump 
                and pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial 
                officials. With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood 
                that other men's wives were created for them, Rostov did not leave 
                the lady's side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial 
                style, as if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally 
                Nicholas and the lady would get on together. The husband, however, 
                did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely 
                with Rostov. But the latter's good-natured naivete was so boundless 
                that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas' good 
                humor. Toward the end of the evening, however, as the wife's face 
                grew more flushed and animated, the husband's became more and 
                more melancholy and solemn, as though there were but a given amount 
                of animation between them and as the wife's share increased the 
                husband's diminished. </p>

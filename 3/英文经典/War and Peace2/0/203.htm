              <p> 　　On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin, accompanied 
                by Lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar 
                orderly, left their quarters at Yankovo, ten miles from Bogucharovo, 
                and went for a ride- to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to 
                find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages.</p>
              <p> 　　For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two 
                hostile armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard 
                to get to it as for the French vanguard; Rostov, as a careful 
                squadron commander, wished to take such provisions as remained 
                at Bogucharovo before the French could get them.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods. On the way 
                to Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm 
                where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, 
                they questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, 
                and raced one another to try Ilyin's horse.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the 
                property of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race 
                along the incline before reaching Bogucharovo, and Rostov, outstripping 
                Ilyin, was the first to gallop into the village street.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're first!&quot; cried Ilyin, flushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,&quot; 
                answered Rostov, stroking his heated Donets horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I'd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,&quot; 
                said Lavrushka from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, 
                &quot;only I didn't wish to mortify you.</p>
              <p> 　　They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of 
                peasants was standing.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new 
                arrivals without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with 
                wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, 
                staggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the 
                officers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine fellows!&quot; said Rostov laughing. &quot;Is there 
                any hay here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how like one another,&quot; said Ilyin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!&quot; sang one of the 
                peasants with a blissful smile.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who do you belong to?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The French,&quot; replied Ilyin jestingly, &quot;and 
                here is Napoleon himself&quot;- and he pointed to Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then you are Russians?&quot; the peasant asked again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And is there a large force of you here?&quot; said another, 
                a short man, coming up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very large,&quot; answered Rostov. &quot;But why have 
                you collected here?&quot; he added. &quot;Is it a holiday?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The old men have met to talk over the business of the 
                commune,&quot; replied the peasant, moving away.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two 
                women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The one in pink is mine, so keep off!&quot; said Ilyin 
                on seeing Dunyasha running resolutely toward him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She'll be ours!&quot; said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you want, my pretty?&quot; said Ilyin with a 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your 
                name.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your 
                humble servant.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Co-o-om-pa-ny!&quot; roared the tipsy peasant with a 
                beatific smile as he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl. Following 
                Dunyasha, Alpatych advanced to Rostov, having bared his head while 
                still at a distance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I make bold to trouble your honor?&quot; said he 
                respectfully, but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness 
                of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom. &quot;My 
                mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkonski 
                who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding herself in difficulties 
                owing to the boorishness of these people&quot;- he pointed to 
                the peasants- &quot;asks you to come up to the house.... Won't 
                you, please, ride on a little farther,&quot; said Alpatych with 
                a melancholy smile, &quot;as it is not convenient in the presence 
                of...?&quot; He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close 
                to him as horseflies to a horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Yakov Alpatych... Grand! Forgive 
                us for Christ's sake, eh?&quot; said the peasants, smiling joyfully 
                at him.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Or perhaps they amuse your honor?&quot; remarked Alpatych 
                with a staid air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, there's not much to be amused at here,&quot; said 
                Rostov, and rode on a little way. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; 
                he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants 
                here don't wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten 
                to unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed 
                up since morning, her excellency cannot get away.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible!&quot; exclaimed Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,&quot; 
                said Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed 
                Alpatych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. 
                It appeared that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the 
                previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually 
                had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and 
                joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent for 
                him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to 
                harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd 
                to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the 
                village: that there was an order not to move, and that they would 
                unharness the horses. Alpatych had gone out to admonish them, 
                but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not 
                showing himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess 
                go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed 
                they would serve her as before and obey her in everything.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the 
                road, Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her 
                nurse, and the maids, had given orders to harness and intended 
                to start, but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken 
                for Frenchmen, the coachman ran away, and the women in the house 
                began to wail.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!&quot; exclaimed 
                deeply moved voices as Rostov passed through the anteroom.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large 
                sitting room, when Rostov was shown in. She could not grasp who 
                he was and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When 
                she saw his Russian face, and by his walk and the first words 
                he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced 
                at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice 
                that faltered and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately 
                struck Rostov as a romantic event. &quot;A helpless girl overwhelmed 
                with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And 
                what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility 
                there are in her features and expression!&quot; thought he as 
                he looked at her and listened to her timid story.</p>
              <p> 　　When she began to tell him that all this had happened the 
                day after her father's funeral, her voiced trembled. She turned 
                away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant 
                to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance 
                of inquiry. There were tears in Rostov's eyes. Princess Mary noticed 
                this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which 
                caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened 
                to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you,&quot; 
                said Rostov, rising. &quot;Go when you please, and I give you 
                my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance 
                if only you will allow me to act as your escort.&quot; And bowing 
                respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward 
                the door.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he 
                would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did 
                not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very, very grateful to you,&quot; she said in French, 
                &quot;but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one 
                is to blame for it.&quot; She suddenly began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me!&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, knitting his brows, left the room with another low 
                bow. </p>

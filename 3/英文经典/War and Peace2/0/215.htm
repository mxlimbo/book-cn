              <p> 　　The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, 
                apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them 
                to stay and have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. 
                The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre's huge stout figure 
                and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, 
                round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and 
                his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks 
                chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you understand the whole position of our troops?&quot; 
                Prince Andrew interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes- that is, how do you mean?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Not 
                being a military man I can't say I have understood it fully, but 
                I understand the general position.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who 
                it may,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh!&quot; said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in 
                perplexity at Prince Andrew. &quot;Well, and what do think of 
                Kutuzov's appointment?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know,&quot; 
                replied Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow 
                they are saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think 
                of him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ask them,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, indicating the 
                officers.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at Timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative 
                smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, 
                your excellency,&quot; said Timokhin timidly, and continually 
                turning to glance at his colonel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why so?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform 
                you. Why, when we were retreating from Sventsyani we dare not 
                touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going 
                away, so he would get it all; wasn't it so, your excellency?&quot; 
                and again Timokhin turned to the prince. &quot;But we daren't. 
                In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind 
                of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became 
                straight forward. Now we see light...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then why was it forbidden?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how 
                to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince 
                Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning 
                to the enemy,&quot; said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. &quot;It 
                is very sound: one can't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom 
                the troops to marauding. At Smolensk too he judged correctly that 
                the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he 
                could not understand this,&quot; cried Prince Andrew in a shrill 
                voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: &quot;he could 
                not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting 
                for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such 
                as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for two 
                days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. 
                He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went 
                for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do 
                the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why 
                he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans 
                out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German 
                has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German 
                valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father's 
                requirements better than you could, then it's all right to let 
                him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you'll send the 
                valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, 
                awkward hands, and will soothe him better than a skilled man who 
                is a stranger could. So it has been with Barclay. While Russia 
                was well, a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister; 
                but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin. 
                But in your Club they have been making him out a traitor! They 
                slander him as a traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards, 
                ashamed of their false accusations, they will make him out a hero 
                or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still more 
                unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And they say he's a skillful commander,&quot; rejoined 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand what is meant by 'a skillful commander,'&quot; 
                replied Prince Andrew ironically.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A skillful commander?&quot; replied Pierre. &quot;Why, 
                one who foresees all contingencies... and foresees the adversary's 
                intentions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that's impossible,&quot; said Prince Andrew as if 
                it were a matter settled long ago.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at him in surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?&quot; 
                he remarked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Prince Andrew, &quot;but with this 
                little difference, that in chess you may think over each move 
                as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this 
                difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, 
                and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion 
                is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than 
                a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never 
                be known to anyone. Believe me,&quot; he went on, &quot;if things 
                depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there 
                making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve 
                here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that 
                on us tomorrow's battle will depend and not on those others.... 
                Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or 
                equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But on what then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the feeling that is in me and in him,&quot; he pointed 
                to Timokhin, &quot;and in each soldier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander 
                in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent 
                taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently 
                not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! 
                Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were 
                almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that 
                we were losing the battle, and we did lose it. And we said so 
                because we had nothing to fight for there, we wanted to get away 
                from the battlefield as soon as we could. 'We've lost, so let 
                us run,' and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening, 
                heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan't 
                say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the 
                right flank too extended,&quot; he went on. &quot;That's all nonsense, 
                there's nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred 
                million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant 
                by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run, and that 
                this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at 
                present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you 
                have ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but 
                hinder. They are only concerned with their own petty interests.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At such a moment?&quot; said Pierre reproachfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At such a moment!&quot; Prince Andrew repeated. &quot;To 
                them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine 
                a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means 
                this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of 
                a hundred thousand have met to fight, and the thing is that these 
                two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more 
                fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will 
                tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the 
                top may make, we shall win tomorrow's battle. Tomorrow, happen 
                what may, we shall win!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, your excellency! That's the truth, the real 
                truth,&quot; said Timokhin. &quot;Who would spare himself now? 
                The soldiers in my battalion, believe me, wouldn't drink their 
                vodka! 'It's not the day for that!' they say.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out 
                of the shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After 
                they had gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to 
                start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses' 
                hoofs on the road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction 
                Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by 
                a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince 
                Andrew involuntarily heard these words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann 
                ich nicht genug Preis geben,&quot;* said one of them. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently 
                commend that view.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, ja,&quot; said the other, &quot;der Zweck ist nur 
                den Feind zu schwachen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der 
                Privat-Personen in Achtung nehmen.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of 
                course one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no,&quot; agreed the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Extend widely!&quot; said Prince Andrew with an angry 
                snort, when they had ridden past. &quot;In that 'extend' were 
                my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills. That's all the same 
                to him! That's what I was saying to you- those German gentlemen 
                won't win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess 
                they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but 
                theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven't in their hearts 
                the one thing needed tomorrow- that which Timokhin has. They have 
                yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine 
                teachers!&quot; and again his voice grew shrill.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you think we shall win tomorrow's battle?&quot; asked 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; answered Prince Andrew absently. &quot;One 
                thing I would do if I had the power,&quot; he began again, &quot;I 
                would not take prisoners. Why take prisoners? It's chivalry! The 
                French have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy 
                Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me every moment. 
                They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And 
                so thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They should be executed! 
                Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may 
                have been said at Tilsit.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; muttered Pierre, looking with shining 
                eyes at Prince Andrew. &quot;I quite agree with you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill 
                and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely 
                solved. He now understood the whole meaning and importance of 
                this war and of the impending battle. All he had seen that day, 
                all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had 
                seen in passing, were lit up for him by a new light. He understood 
                that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which 
                was present in all these men he had seen, and this explained to 
                him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not take prisoners,&quot; Prince Andrew continued: &quot;That 
                by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. 
                As it is we have played at war- that's what's vile! We play at 
                magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility 
                are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints 
                when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kind-hearted that 
                she can't look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up 
                with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, 
                of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It's 
                all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged 
                us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people's houses, 
                issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children 
                and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to 
                foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come 
                to this as I have through the same sufferings...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him 
                whether or not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly 
                checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He 
                paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered 
                feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should 
                go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, 
                as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Ivanovich had 
                offended Michael Ivanovich. And when there was a war, like this 
                one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops 
                would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians 
                whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and 
                we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing 
                why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; 
                and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought 
                to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all 
                lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not 
                a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle 
                and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? 
                What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; 
                the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, 
                the ruin of a country's inhabitants, robbing them or stealing 
                to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military 
                craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, 
                that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, 
                and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, 
                respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear 
                military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest 
                rewards.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one 
                another; they kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving 
                services for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate 
                the number), and they announce a victory, supposing that the more 
                people they have killed the greater their achievement. How does 
                God above look at them and hear them?&quot; exclaimed Prince Andrew 
                in a shrill, piercing voice. &quot;Ah, my friend, it has of late 
                become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to understand 
                too much. And it doesn't do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge 
                of good and evil.... Ah, well, it's not for long!&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;However, you're sleepy, and it's time for me to sleep. 
                Go back to Gorki!&quot; said Prince Andrew suddenly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh no!&quot; Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew 
                with frightened, compassionate eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, go! Before a battle one must have one's sleep out,&quot; 
                repeated Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. 
                &quot;Good-by, be off!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Whether we meet 
                again or not...&quot; and turning away hurriedly he entered the 
                shed.</p>
              <p> 　　It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether 
                the expression of Prince Andrew's face was angry or tender.</p>
              <p> 　　For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should 
                follow him or go away. &quot;No, he does not want it!&quot; Pierre 
                concluded. &quot;And I know that this is our last meeting!&quot; 
                He sighed deeply and rode back to Gorki.</p>
              <p> 　　On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but 
                he could not sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. 
                On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled 
                an evening in Petersburg. Natasha with animated and excited face 
                was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous 
                summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She incoherently 
                described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a talk with 
                a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to say: 
                &quot;No, I can't! I'm not telling it right; no, you don't understand,&quot; 
                though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand, and 
                he really had understood all she wanted to say. But Natasha was 
                not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did not convey 
                the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and 
                wished to convey. &quot;He was such a delightful old man, and 
                it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I 
                can't describe it,&quot; she had said, flushed and excited. Prince 
                Andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked 
                into her eyes. &quot;I understood her,&quot; he thought. &quot;I 
                not only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual 
                force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul- that very soul 
                of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body- it was that soul 
                I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...&quot; and suddenly 
                he remembered how his love had ended. &quot;He did not need anything 
                of that kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. 
                He only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he 
                did not deign to unite his fate. And I?... and he is still alive 
                and gay!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and 
                again began pacing up and down in front of the shed.</p>

              <p> 　　Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he 
                felt himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness 
                of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud 
                of projectiles, groans and cries, and smelled blood and powder, 
                and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled 
                with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under 
                his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone's orderly 
                passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked 
                to the innkeeper. Above Pierre's head some pigeons, disturbed 
                by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the 
                dark roof of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated 
                by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre 
                at that moment. He could see the clear starry sky between the 
                dark roofs of two penthouses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God, there is no more of that!&quot; he thought, 
                covering up his head again. &quot;Oh, what a terrible thing is 
                fear, and how shamefully I yielded to it! But they... they were 
                steady and calm all the time, to the end...&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　They, in Pierre's mind, were the soldiers, those who had been 
                at the battery, those who had given him food, and those who had 
                prayed before the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously 
                known, stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To be a soldier, just a soldier!&quot; thought Pierre 
                as he fell asleep, &quot;to enter communal life completely, to 
                be imbued by what makes them what they are. But how cast off all 
                the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man? There was a 
                time when I could have done it. I could have run away from my 
                father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve as 
                a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov.&quot; And the memory of 
                the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged Dolokhov 
                flashed through Pierre's mind, and then he remembered his benefactor 
                at Torzhok. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge 
                presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English 
                Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table. 
                &quot;Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!&quot; 
                thought Pierre. &quot;Yes, he died, and I did not know he was 
                alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he 
                is alive again!&quot; On one side of the table sat Anatole, Dolokhov, 
                Nesvitski, Denisov, and others like them (in his dream the category 
                to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind 
                as the category of those he termed they), and he heard those people, 
                Anatole and Dolokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet through 
                their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking 
                all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted 
                as the booming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting. 
                Pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying, but 
                he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in 
                his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the possibility 
                of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind, firm 
                faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they 
                were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. 
                Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but 
                at that moment his legs grew cold and bare. He felt ashamed, and 
                with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact 
                slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre opened 
                his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but 
                now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or 
                dew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is dawn,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;But that's not 
                what I want. I want to hear and understand my benefactor's words.&quot; 
                Again he covered himself up with his cloak, but now neither the 
                lodge nor his benefactor was there. There were only thoughts clearly 
                expressed in words, thoughts that someone was uttering or that 
                he himself was formulating.</p>
              <p> 　　Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced 
                that someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions 
                of that day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been 
                able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To endure war is the most difficult subordination of 
                man's freedom to the law of God,&quot; the voice had said. &quot;Simplicity 
                is submission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. 
                And they are simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word 
                is silver but the unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing 
                while he fears death, but he who does not fear it possesses all. 
                If there were no suffering, man would not know his limitations, 
                would not know himself. The hardest thing [Pierre went on thinking, 
                or hearing, in his dream] is to be able in your soul to unite 
                the meaning of all. To unite all?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;No, 
                not to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these 
                thoughts together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, 
                must harness them!&quot; he repeated to himself with inward rapture, 
                feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted 
                to say and solved the question that tormented him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your 
                excellency!&quot; some voice was repeating. &quot;We must harness, 
                it is time to harness....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun 
                shone straight into Pierre's face. He glanced at the dirty innyard 
                in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses 
                at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned 
                away with repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on 
                the carriage seat. &quot;No, I don't want that, I don't want to 
                see and understand that. I want to understand what was revealing 
                itself to me in my dream. One second more and I should have understood 
                it all! But what am I to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?&quot; 
                and Pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen 
                and thought in the dream had been destroyed.</p>
              <p> 　　The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that 
                an officer had come with news that the French were already near 
                Mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake 
                him, went on foot through the town.</p>
              <p> 　　The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded 
                behind them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of 
                the houses, and the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, 
                around carts that were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, 
                curses, and blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his 
                carriage, which had overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, 
                and drove with him to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the 
                death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.</p>

              <p> 　　Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages, 
                packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front 
                door. One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the 
                yard.</p>
              <p> 　　The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted 
                Sonya's attention as it passed the front porch. With the help 
                of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge 
                high coach that stood at the entrance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whose caleche is that?&quot; she inquired, leaning out 
                of the carriage window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, didn't you know, Miss?&quot; replied the maid. 
                &quot;The wounded prince: he spent the night in our house and 
                is going with us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But who is it? What's his name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's our intended that was- Prince Bolkonski himself! 
                They say he is dying,&quot; replied the maid with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The 
                countess, tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for 
                her journey, was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting 
                for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with 
                closed doors before starting. Natasha was not in the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma,&quot; said Sonya, &quot;Prince Andrew is here, 
                mortally wounded. He is going with us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's 
                arm, glanced around.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha?&quot; she murmured.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment this news had only one significance for both 
                of them. They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen 
                if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both 
                liked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us,&quot; 
                said Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You say he is dying?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya nodded.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The ways of God are past finding out!&quot; she thought, 
                feeling that the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming 
                manifest in all that was now taking place.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?&quot; 
                asked Natasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing,&quot; answered the countess. &quot;If everything 
                is ready let us start.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated 
                face. Sonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked at her inquiringly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? What has happened?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing... No...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it something very bad for me? What is it?&quot; persisted 
                Natasha with her quick intuition.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss, 
                Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, 
                having closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some 
                moments silently seated without looking at one another.</p>
              <p> 　　The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed 
                himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the 
                count embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain 
                in Moscow, and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder 
                he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and 
                comforting words. The countess went into the oratory and there 
                Sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left 
                here and there hanging on the wall. (The most precious ones, with 
                which some family tradition was connected, were being taken with 
                them.)</p>
              <p> 　　In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed 
                with swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high 
                boots and with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave 
                of those remaining behind.</p>
              <p> 　　As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten 
                or put in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants 
                stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps 
                waiting to help the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions 
                and bundles from the house to the carriages, the caleche, the 
                phaeton, and back again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They always will forget everything!&quot; said the countess. 
                &quot;Don't you know I can't sit like that?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with 
                an aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange 
                the seat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, those servants!&quot; said the count, swaying his 
                head.</p>
              <p> 　　Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess 
                trusted to drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not 
                so much as glance round at what was going on behind him. From 
                thirty years' experience he knew it would be some time yet before 
                the order, &quot;Be off, in God's name!&quot; would be given him: 
                and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once 
                or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had 
                been forgotten, and even after that he would again be stopped 
                and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg 
                him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He 
                knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, 
                with more patience than the horses, especially the near one, the 
                chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. 
                At last all were seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled 
                up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a traveling case, 
                and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say. Then 
                Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself. The 
                postilion and all the other servants did the same. &quot;Off, 
                in God's name!&quot; said Efim, putting on his hat. &quot;Start!&quot; 
                The postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at 
                his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach 
                swayed. The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which 
                jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the 
                other vehicles jolted in their turn, and the procession of carriages 
                moved up the street. In the carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, 
                all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the 
                house. Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side 
                of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.</p>
              <p> 　　Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, 
                sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the 
                slowly receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally 
                she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then 
                forward at the long train of wounded in front of them. Almost 
                at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of Prince 
                Andrew's caleche. She did not know who was in it, but each time 
                she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche. She 
                knew it was right in front.</p>
              <p> 　　In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets 
                came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', 
                and as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and 
                carts formed two rows abreast.</p>
              <p> 　　As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, 
                who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving 
                or walking past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who? Who?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!&quot; said Natasha, 
                putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout 
                man in a coachman's long coat, who from his manner of walking 
                and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was 
                passing under the arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a 
                small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with 
                a queer-looking old boy. Really,&quot; said Natasha, &quot;look, 
                look!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma,&quot; screamed Natasha, &quot;I'll stake my head 
                it's he! I assure you! Stop, stop!&quot; she cried to the coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski 
                Street came more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being 
                shouted at to move on and not block the way.</p>
              <p> 　　In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, 
                the Rostovs all saw Pierre- or someone extraordinarily like him- 
                in a coachman's coat, going down the street with head bent and 
                a serious face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like 
                a footman. That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage 
                window gazing at them, and respectfully touching Pierre's elbow 
                said something to him and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently 
                engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him. At length 
                when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man 
                indicated, he recognized Natasha, and following his first impulse 
                stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken 
                a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical 
                kindliness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! 
                This is wonderful!&quot; she cried, holding out her hand to him. 
                &quot;What are you doing? Why are you like this?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly 
                as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter, Count?&quot; asked the countess 
                in a surprised and commiserating tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What? Why? Don't ask me,&quot; said Pierre, and 
                looked round at Natasha whose radiant, happy expression- of which 
                he was conscious without looking at her- filled him with enchantment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you remaining in Moscow, then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre hesitated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In Moscow?&quot; he said in a questioning tone. &quot;Yes, 
                in Moscow. Goodby!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. 
                How splendid!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Mamma, if you'll let me, 
                I'll stay!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something, 
                but the countess interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You were at the battle, we heard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I was,&quot; Pierre answered. &quot;There will 
                be another battle tomorrow...&quot; he began, but Natasha interrupted 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not 
                like yourself....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't know myself. 
                Tomorrow... But no! Good-by, good-by!&quot; he muttered. &quot;It's 
                an awful time!&quot; and dropping behind the carriage he stepped 
                onto the pavement.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, 
                beaming at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.

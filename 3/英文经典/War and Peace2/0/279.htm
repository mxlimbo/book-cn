              <p> 　　Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt 
                that he was dying and was already half dead. He was conscious 
                of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous 
                lightness of existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited 
                what was coming. That inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown 
                the presence of which he had felt continually all his life- was 
                now near to him and, by the strange lightness he experienced, 
                almost comprehensible and palpable... </p>
              <p> 　　Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that 
                terribly tormenting fear of death- the end- but now he no longer 
                understood that fear.</p>
              <p> 　　 He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like 
                a top before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, 
                and the sky, and knew that he was face to face with death. When 
                he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal, 
                unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if 
                freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it, he no longer 
                feared death and ceased to think about it.</p>
              <p> 　　During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium 
                he spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into 
                the new principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he 
                unconsciously detached himself from earthly life. To love everything 
                and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not 
                to love anyone, not to live this earthly life. And the more imbued 
                he became with that principle of love, the more he renounced life 
                and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which- 
                in the absence of such love- stands between life and death. When 
                during those first days he remembered that he would have to die, 
                he said to himself: &quot;Well, what of it? So much the better!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But after the night in Mytishchi when, half delirious, he 
                had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and, having 
                pressed her hand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love 
                for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and 
                once more bound him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts 
                began to occupy his mind. Recalling the moment at the ambulance 
                station when he had seen Kuragin, he could not now regain the 
                feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question whether 
                Kuragin was alive. And he dared not inquire.</p>
              <p> 　　His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha 
                referred to when she said: &quot;This suddenly happened,&quot; 
                had occurred two days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the 
                last spiritual struggle between life and death, in which death 
                gained the victory. It was the unexpected realization of the fact 
                that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his 
                love for Natasha, and a last, though ultimately vanquished, attack 
                of terror before the unknown.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, 
                and his thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sonya was sitting 
                by the table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness 
                seized him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, she has come!&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　And so it was: in Sonya's place sat Natasha who had just come 
                in noiselessly.</p>
              <p> 　　Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced 
                this physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in 
                an armchair placed sideways, screening the light of the candle 
                from him, and was knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit 
                stockings since Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one 
                nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings, and 
                that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings. 
                The needles clicked lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, 
                and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping 
                face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She started, 
                glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand stooped 
                carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball, 
                and regained her former position.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to 
                draw a deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so 
                and breathed cautiously.</p>
              <p> 　　At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and 
                he had told her that if he lived he would always thank God for 
                his wound which had brought them together again, but after that 
                they never spoke of the future.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can it or can it not be?&quot; he now thought as he 
                looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles. 
                &quot;Can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me 
                to die?... Is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed 
                to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity? I 
                love her more than anything in the world! But what am I to do 
                if I love her?&quot; he thought, and he involuntarily groaned, 
                from a habit acquired during his sufferings.</p>
              <p> 　　On hearing that sound Natasha put down the stocking, leaned 
                nearer to him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped 
                lightly up to him and bent over him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are not asleep?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you 
                come in. No one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity 
                that you do... that light. I want to weep for joy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous 
                joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in 
                the world.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I!&quot;- She turned away for an instant. &quot;Why 
                too much?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel 
                in your soul, your whole soul- shall I live? What do you think?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sure of it, sure!&quot; Natasha almost shouted, 
                taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained silent awhile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How good it would be!&quot; and taking her hand he kissed 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that 
                this would not do and that he had to be quiet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you have not slept,&quot; she said, repressing her 
                joy. &quot;Try to sleep... please!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to 
                the candle and sat down again in her former position. Twice she 
                turned and looked at him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. 
                She set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn 
                round till it was finished.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep 
                long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.</p>
              <p> 　　As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject 
                that now always occupied his mind- about life and death, and chiefly 
                about death. He felt himself nearer to it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Love? What is love?&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that 
                I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, 
                everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by 
                it alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of 
                love, shall return to the general and eternal source.&quot; These 
                thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were only thoughts. 
                Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they were 
                too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former 
                agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, 
                but that he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, 
                and insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them 
                and discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away 
                somewhere. Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial 
                and that he had more important cares, but he continued to speak, 
                surprising them by empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all 
                these persons began to disappear and a single question, that of 
                the closed door, superseded all else. He rose and went to the 
                door to bolt and lock it. Everything depended on whether he was, 
                or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and tried to hurry, but 
                his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to 
                lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He 
                was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of 
                death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily 
                creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other 
                side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something 
                not human- death- was breaking in through that door, and had to 
                be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold 
                it back- to lock it was no longer possible- but his efforts were 
                weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, 
                opened and closed again.</p>
              <p> 　　Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts 
                were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, 
                and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.</p>
              <p> 　　But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that 
                he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an 
                effort, he awoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it was death! I died- and woke up. Yes, death is 
                an awakening!&quot; And all at once it grew light in his soul 
                and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted 
                from his spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till then confined 
                within him had been liberated, and that strange lightness did 
                not again leave him.</p>
              <p> 　　When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, 
                Natasha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not 
                answer and looked at her strangely, not understanding.</p>
              <p> 　　That was what had happened to him two days before Princess 
                Mary's arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the 
                wasting fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor 
                said did not interest Natasha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms 
                which to her were more convincing.</p>
              <p> 　　From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew 
                together with his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration 
                of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep 
                compared to the duration of a dream.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively 
                slow awakening.</p>
              <p> 　　His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. 
                Both Princess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this. 
                They did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves 
                felt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, 
                he had left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him- 
                his body. Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible 
                side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary 
                to foment their grief. Neither in his presence nor out of it did 
                they weep, nor did they ever talk to one another about him. They 
                felt that they could not express in words what they understood.</p>
              <p> 　　They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper 
                and deeper, away from them, and they both knew that this had to 
                be so and that it was right.</p>
              <p> 　　He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take 
                leave of him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his 
                lips to the boy's and turned away, not because he felt it hard 
                and sad (Princess Mary and Natasha understood that) but simply 
                because he thought it was all that was required of him, but when 
                they told him to bless the boy, he did what was demanded and looked 
                round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do.</p>
              <p> 　　When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was 
                leaving, occurred, Princess Mary and Natasha were present.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it over?&quot; said Princess Mary when his body had 
                for a few minutes lain motionless, growing cold before them. Natasha 
                went up, looked at the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. 
                She closed them but did not kiss them, but clung to that which 
                reminded her most nearly of him- his body.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where has he gone? Where is he now?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a 
                table, everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.</p>
              <p> 　　Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful 
                perplexity. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha 
                and because he was no more. The old count cried because he felt 
                that before long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of 
                their own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening 
                emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness 
                of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished 
                in their presence. </p>

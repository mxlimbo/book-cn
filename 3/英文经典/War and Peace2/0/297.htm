              <p> 　　From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign 
                all Kutuzov's activity was directed toward restraining his troops, 
                by authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks, 
                maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhturov went 
                to Malo-Yaroslavets, but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and 
                gave orders for the evacuation of Kaluga- a retreat beyond which 
                town seemed to him quite possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Everywhere Kutuzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting 
                for his retreat fled in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers 
                at Tarutino and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what 
                would have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into 
                the rich southern provinces.</p>
              <p> 　　But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from 
                advancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army 
                did not bar his way), the historians forget that nothing could 
                have saved his army, for then already it bore within itself the 
                germs of inevitable ruin. How could that army- which had found 
                abundant supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead 
                of keeping them, and on arriving at Smolensk had looted provisions 
                instead of storing them- how could that army recuperate in Kaluga 
                province, which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived 
                in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of consuming what 
                was set ablaze?</p>
              <p> 　　That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of 
                Borodino and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, 
                as it were, the chemical elements of dissolution.</p>
              <p> 　　The members of what had once been an army- Napoleon himself 
                and all his soldiers fled- without knowing whither, each concerned 
                only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position, 
                of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely 
                conscious.</p>
              <p> 　　So it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets, 
                when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various 
                opinions, all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the 
                simple-minded soldier Mouton who, speaking last, said what they 
                all felt: that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly 
                as possible; and no one, not even Napoleon, could say anything 
                against that truth which they all recognized.</p>
              <p> 　　But though they all realized that it was necessary to get 
                away, there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that 
                they must flee. An external shock was needed to overcome that 
                shame, and this shock came in due time. It was what the French 
                called &quot;le hourra de l'Empereur.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode 
                out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite 
                of marshals and an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army 
                and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle. Some 
                Cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very 
                nearly captured him. If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon 
                then, what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the 
                French army, the booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as at 
                Tarutino they went after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding 
                Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to 
                escape.</p>
              <p> 　　When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor 
                himself in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was 
                nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, 
                familiar road. Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood 
                that hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under 
                the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once 
                agreed with Mouton and issued orders- as the historians tell us- 
                to retreat by the Smolensk road.</p>
              <p> 　　That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, 
                does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the 
                forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the 
                Mozhaysk (that is, the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on 
                him also. </p>

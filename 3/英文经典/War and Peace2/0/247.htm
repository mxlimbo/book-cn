              <p> 　　For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had 
                been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdeev. 
                This is how it happened.</p>
              <p> 　　When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow 
                and his interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some 
                time make out where he was and what was expected of him. When 
                he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception 
                room there was a Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, 
                the Countess Helene, he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of 
                confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He 
                felt that everything was now at an end, all was in confusion and 
                crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the future 
                held nothing, and there was no escape from this position. Smiling 
                unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat down on the 
                sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door of 
                the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing 
                his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second 
                time to say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from 
                the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, 
                and that someone from Bazdeev's widow had called to ask Pierre 
                to take charge of her husband's books, as she herself was leaving 
                for the country.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... 
                go and say I will come directly,&quot; Pierre replied to the major-domo.</p>
              <p> 　　But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his 
                hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by 
                the other door. There was no one in the passage. He went along 
                the whole length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and 
                rubbing his forehead with both hands, went down as far as the 
                first landing. The hall porter was standing at the front door. 
                From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase 
                leading to the back entrance. He went down that staircase and 
                out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were some carriages 
                waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen 
                and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him. 
                When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich 
                which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung 
                his head and quickening his pace went down the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of 
                Joseph Bazdeev's books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to 
                the Patriarch's Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev's house was.</p>
              <p> 　　Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts 
                that were making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing 
                his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, 
                Pierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from 
                school, began to talk to his driver.</p>
              <p> 　　The man told him that arms were being distributed today at 
                the Kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond 
                the Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.</p>
              <p> 　　Having reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs' 
                house, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up 
                to the gate. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had 
                seen at Torzhok five years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out 
                in answer to his knock.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At home?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danilovna 
                has gone to the Torzhok estate with the children, your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will come in all the same, I have to look through 
                the books,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be so good as to step in. Makar Alexeevich, the brother 
                of my late master- may the kingdom of heaven be his- has remained 
                here, but he is in a weak state as you know,&quot; said the old 
                servant.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's half-insane 
                brother and a hard drinker.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...&quot; said Pierre 
                and entered the house.</p>
              <p> 　　A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing 
                gown and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. 
                On seeing Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along 
                the passage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, 
                as your honor sees,&quot; said Gerasim. &quot;Will you step into 
                the study?&quot; Pierre nodded. &quot;As it was sealed up so it 
                has remained, but Sophia Danilovna gave orders that if anyone 
                should come from you they were to have the books.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with 
                such trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime. The room, dusty 
                and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.</p>
              <p> 　　Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. 
                Pierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which 
                the manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one 
                of the most important, the holy of holies of the order. This was 
                the authentic Scotch Acts with Bazdeev's notes and explanations. 
                He sat down at the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts 
                before him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them 
                away, and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.</p>
              <p> 　　Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and 
                saw Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of 
                making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but 
                Pierre did not hear him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes!&quot; said Pierre, rousing himself and rising 
                hurriedly. &quot;Look here,&quot; he added, taking Gerasim by 
                a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist, 
                shining, and ecstatic eyes, &quot;I say, do you know that there 
                is going to be a battle tomorrow?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We heard so,&quot; replied the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what 
                I ask you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; replied Gerasim. &quot;Will 
                you have something to eat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes 
                and a pistol,&quot; said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; said Gerasim after thinking 
                for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's 
                study, and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner 
                to another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a 
                bed made up for him there.</p>
              <p> 　　Gerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange 
                things, accepted Pierre's taking up his residence in the house 
                without surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. 
                That same evening- without even asking himself what they were 
                wanted for- he procured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, 
                and promised to get him the pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich 
                came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far 
                as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But 
                as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown 
                around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. 
                It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman's coat which Gerasim 
                had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his 
                way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Sukharev market 
                that he met the Rostovs. </p>

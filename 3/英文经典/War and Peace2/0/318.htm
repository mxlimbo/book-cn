              <p> 　　When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: 
                substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But 
                when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides 
                this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance, a 
                spiritual wound, which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal 
                and sometimes heals, but always aches and shrinks at any external 
                irritating touch.</p>
              <p> 　　After Prince Andrew's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike 
                felt this. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the 
                menacing cloud of death that overhung them, they dared not look 
                life in the face. They carefully guarded their open wounds from 
                any rough and painful contact. Everything: a carriage passing 
                rapidly in the street, a summons to dinner, the maid's inquiry 
                what dress to prepare, or worse still any word of insincere or 
                feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully irritated the wound, 
                interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to 
                listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in 
                their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those mysterious 
                limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them.</p>
              <p> 　　Only when alone together were they free from such outrage 
                and pain. They spoke little even to one another, and when they 
                did it was of very unimportant matters.</p>
              <p> 　　Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility 
                of a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully 
                did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed 
                to them that what they had lived through and experienced could 
                not be expressed in words, and that any reference to the details 
                of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery 
                that had been accomplished before their eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of 
                everything that might lead up to the subject- this halting on 
                all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention- brought 
                before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what 
                they were both feeling.</p>
              <p> 　　But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and 
                complete joy. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent 
                arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, 
                was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow 
                in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight. She received letters 
                from her relations to which she had to reply; the room in which 
                little Nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych 
                came to Yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and 
                with advice and suggestions that they should return to Moscow 
                to the house on the Vozdvizhenka Street, which had remained uninjured 
                and needed only slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it 
                was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge 
                from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived 
                till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natasha 
                alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily 
                yielded to them. She went through the accounts with Alpatych, 
                conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and 
                made preparations for the journey to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began 
                making preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her 
                to Moscow, and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they 
                saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that 
                a change of scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good 
                for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not going anywhere,&quot; Natasha replied when 
                this was proposed to her. &quot;Do please just leave me alone!&quot; 
                And she ran out of the room, with difficulty refraining from tears 
                of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone 
                in her grief, Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself, 
                sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing 
                and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing 
                intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. 
                This solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute 
                need of it. As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly, changed 
                her position and expression, and picked up a book or some sewing, 
                evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go.</p>
              <p> 　　She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate 
                that on which- with a terrible questioning too great for her strength- 
                her spiritual gaze was fixed.</p>
              <p> 　　One day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, 
                dressed in a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted 
                into a knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, 
                nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while 
                she looked at a corner of the door.</p>
              <p> 　　She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone- to the 
                other side of life. And that other side of life, of which she 
                had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her 
                so far away and improbable, was now nearer and more akin and more 
                comprehensible than this side of life, where everything was either 
                emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity.</p>
              <p> 　　She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not 
                imagine him otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him 
                again as he had been at Mytishchi, at Troitsa, and at Yaroslavl.</p>
              <p> 　　She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and 
                her own, and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.</p>
              <p> 　　There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, 
                leaning his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully 
                hollow and his shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his 
                eyes glitter, and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. 
                One of his legs twitches just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha 
                knows that he is struggling with terrible pain. &quot;What is 
                that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What does he feel? 
                How does it hurt him?&quot; thought Natasha. He noticed her watching 
                him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One thing would be terrible,&quot; said he: &quot;to 
                bind oneself forever to a suffering man. It would be continual 
                torture.&quot; And he looked searchingly at her. Natasha as usual 
                answered before she had time to think what she would say. She 
                said: &quot;This can't go on- it won't. You will get well- quite 
                well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived 
                what she had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look 
                at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair 
                in that protracted gaze.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I agreed,&quot; Natasha now said to herself, &quot;that 
                it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer. I said 
                it then only because it would have been dreadful for him, but 
                he understood it differently. He thought it would be dreadful 
                for me. He then still wished to live and feared death. And I said 
                it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant. I thought 
                quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have said: 
                even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes, 
                I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there 
                is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never 
                will know it. And now it will never, never be possible to put 
                it right.&quot; And now he again seemed to be saying the same 
                words to her, only in her imagination Natasha this time gave him 
                a different answer. She stopped him and said: &quot;Terrible for 
                you, but not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in 
                life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness 
                for me,&quot; and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed 
                it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her 
                imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might 
                have said then but only spoke now: &quot;I love thee!... thee! 
                I love, love...&quot; she said, convulsively pressing her hands 
                and setting her teeth with a desperate effort...</p>
              <p> 　　She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising 
                in her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying 
                this. Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and 
                again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where 
                he was. And now, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the 
                mystery.... But at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible 
                was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck 
                painfully on her ears. Dunyasha, her maid, entered the room quickly 
                and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no 
                concern for her mistress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come to your Papa at once, please!&quot; said she with 
                a strange, excited look. &quot;A misfortune... about Peter Ilynich... 
                a letter,&quot; she finished with a sob.</p>

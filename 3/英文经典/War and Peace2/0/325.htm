              <p> 　　One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched 
                conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time- lacking 
                warm boots and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, 
                in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full 
                rations (the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)- 
                they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.</p>
              <p> 　　On the contrary, the army had never under the best material 
                conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This 
                was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength 
                were sifted out of the army day by day. All the physically or 
                morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower 
                of the army- physically and mentally- remained.</p>
              <p> 　　More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company 
                than anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them 
                and their campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit 
                by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, Makeev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? 
                Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!&quot; 
                shouted a red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and 
                blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. 
                &quot;And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!&quot; said he 
                to another soldier.</p>
              <p> 　　This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, 
                but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The 
                soldier they called &quot;Jackdaw,&quot; a thin little fellow 
                with a sharp nose, rose obediently and was about to go but at 
                that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender, 
                handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bring it here- that's fine!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew 
                at it with their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their 
                greatcoats, making the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer 
                and lit their pipes. The handsome young soldier who had brought 
                the wood, setting his arms akimbo, began stamping his cold feet 
                rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It's well that 
                I'm a musketeer...&quot; he sang, pretending to hiccough after 
                each syllable.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look out, your soles will fly off!&quot; shouted the 
                red-haired man, noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was 
                hanging loose. &quot;What a fellow you are for dancing!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, 
                and threw it on the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Right enough, friend,&quot; said he, and, having sat 
                down, took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and 
                wrapped it round his foot. &quot;It's the steam that spoils them,&quot; 
                he added, stretching out his feet toward the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when 
                we've finished hammering them, we're to receive double kits!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after 
                all, it seems,&quot; said one sergeant major.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've had an eye on him this long while,&quot; said the 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, he's a poor sort of soldier...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing 
                yesterday.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's feet are frozen 
                how can he walk?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh? Don't talk nonsense!&quot; said a sergeant major.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you want to be doing the same?&quot; said an old 
                soldier, turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen 
                feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you know,&quot; said the sharp-nosed man they 
                called Jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself 
                at the other side of the fire, &quot;a plump man gets thin, but 
                for a thin one it's death. Take me, now! I've got no strength 
                left,&quot; he added, with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant 
                major. &quot;Tell them to send me to hospital; I'm aching all 
                over; anyway I shan't be able to keep up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That'll do, that'll do!&quot; replied the sergeant major 
                quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldier said no more and the talk went on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and 
                the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real 
                boots on,&quot; said a soldier, starting a new theme. &quot;They 
                were no more than make-believes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing 
                the hut for the colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to 
                see them, boys,&quot; put in the dancer. &quot;As they turned 
                them over one seemed still alive and, would you believe it, he 
                jabbered something in their lingo.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But they're a clean folk, lads,&quot; the first man 
                went on; &quot;he was white- as white as birchbark- and some of 
                them are such fine fellows, you might think they were nobles.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes 
                there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But they don't understand our talk at all,&quot; said 
                the dancer with a puzzled smile. &quot;I asked him whose subject 
                he was, and he jabbered in his own way. A queer lot!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's strange, friends,&quot; continued the man who 
                had wondered at their whiteness, &quot;the peasants at Mozhaysk 
                were saying that when they began burying the dead- where the battle 
                was you know- well, those dead had been lying there for nearly 
                a month, and says the peasant, 'they lie as white as paper, clean, 
                and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Was it from the cold?&quot; asked someone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it 
                was hot. If it had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted 
                either. 'But,' he says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten 
                and maggoty. So,' he says, 'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs 
                and turn our heads away as we drag them off: we can hardly do 
                it. But theirs,' he says, 'are white as paper and not so much 
                smell as a whiff of gunpowder.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It must be from their food,&quot; said the sergeant 
                major. &quot;They used to gobble the same food as the gentry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No one contradicted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said 
                the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted 
                for twenty days and still didn't finish carting the dead away. 
                And as for the wolves, he says...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That was a real battle,&quot; said an old soldier. &quot;It's 
                the only one worth remembering; but since that... it's only been 
                tormenting folk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we 
                ran at them and, my word, they didn't let us get near before they 
                just threw down their muskets and went on their knees. 'Pardon!' 
                they say. That's only one case. They say Platov took 'Poleon himself 
                twice. But he didn't know the right charm. He catches him and 
                catches him- no good! He turns into a bird in his hands and flies 
                away. And there's no way of killing him either.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I come to look 
                at you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Liar, indeed! It's the real truth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught him I'd bury 
                him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a 
                lot of men he's ruined!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He won't come here 
                again,&quot; remarked the old soldier, yawning.</p>
              <p> 　　The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling 
                down to sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they shine! You 
                would think the women had spread out their linen,&quot; said one 
                of the men, gazing with admiration at the Milky Way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a sign of a good harvest next year.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall want some more wood.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That's 
                queer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? 
                Look how he's sprawling!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen 
                asleep could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, 
                now and again exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred 
                paces off came a sound of general, merry laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!&quot; 
                said one of the soldiers, and what a lot of them there are!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They're having such fun,&quot; said he, coming back. 
                &quot;Two Frenchies have turned up. One's quite frozen and the 
                other's an awful swaggerer. He's singing songs....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I'll go across and have a look....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.</p>

              <p> 　　For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window 
                of her room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached 
                her from the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. 
                She felt that she could not understand them however much she might 
                think about them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, 
                after the break caused by cares for the present, seemed already 
                to belong to the past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.</p>
              <p> 　　After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and 
                fresh. Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, 
                the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh 
                white dewy mist began to rise, and stillness reigned over the 
                village and the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Pictures of the near past- her father's illness and last moments- 
                rose one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she 
                now lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the 
                last one, the picture of his death, which she felt she could not 
                contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour 
                of night. And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly 
                and in such detail that they seemed now present, now past, and 
                now future.</p>
              <p> 　　She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke 
                and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden 
                at Bald Hills, muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching 
                his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day 
                he died,&quot; she thought. &quot;He had always thought what he 
                said then.&quot; And she recalled in all its detail the night 
                at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke, when with a foreboding 
                of disaster she had remained at home against his will. She had 
                not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going to the 
                door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened 
                at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something 
                to Tikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the 
                Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. &quot;And why didn't 
                he call me? Why didn't he let me be there instead of Tikhon?&quot; 
                Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. &quot;Now he 
                will never tell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that 
                moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he 
                longed to say, and not Tikhon but I might have heard and understood 
                him. Why didn't I enter the room?&quot; she thought. &quot;Perhaps 
                he would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While 
                talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, 
                and I was standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and 
                painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him. 
                I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were 
                alive- he had forgotten she was dead- and Tikhon reminded him 
                that she was no more, and he shouted, 'Fool!' He was greatly depressed. 
                From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning 
                and loudly exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't I go in then? What 
                could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps 
                he would then have been comforted and would have said that word 
                to me.&quot; And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word 
                he had said to her on the day of his death. &quot;Dear-est!&quot; 
                she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears that relieved her 
                soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the face she had 
                known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance, 
                but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first time quite 
                closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she stooped near 
                to his mouth to catch what he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear-est!&quot; she repeated again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What 
                is he thinking now?&quot; This question suddenly presented itself 
                to her, and in answer she saw him before her with the expression 
                that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound 
                up with a white handkerchief. And the horror that had seized her 
                when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he, 
                but something mysterious and horrible, seized her again. She tried 
                to think of something else and to pray, but could do neither. 
                With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows, 
                expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that 
                the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dunyasha,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Dunyasha!&quot; 
                she screamed wildly, and tearing herself out of this silence she 
                ran to the servants' quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants 
                who came running toward her. </p>

              <p> 　　On the evening of the first of September, after his interview 
                with Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified 
                and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council 
                of war, and because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer 
                to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel 
                outlook revealed to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity 
                of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary 
                but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, 
                and surprised by all this, Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. 
                After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was 
                awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter 
                from Kutuzov. This letter requested the count to send police officers 
                to guide the troops through the town, as the army was retreating 
                to the Ryazan road beyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchin. 
                He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since his 
                interview the previous day with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but 
                ever since the battle of Borodino, for all the generals who came 
                to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible 
                to fight another battle, and since then the government property 
                had been removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left 
                the city with Rostopchin's own permission. Yet all the same this 
                information astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did 
                in the form of a simple note with an order from Kutuzov, and received 
                at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his 
                actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated 
                by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow 
                and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts 
                this twofold aim all Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable. 
                &quot;Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, 
                and stores of corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants 
                deceived into believing that Moscow would not be given up- and 
                thereby ruined?&quot; &quot;To presence the tranquillity of the 
                city,&quot; explains Count Rostopchin. &quot;Why were bundles 
                of useless papers from the government offices, and Leppich's balloon 
                and other articles removed?&quot; &quot;To leave the town empty,&quot; 
                explains Count Rostopchin. One need only admit that public tranquillity 
                is in danger and any action finds a justification.</p>
              <p> 　　All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on 
                solicitude for public tranquillity.</p>
              <p> 　　On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity 
                of Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any 
                probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving 
                it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that 
                cause the masses to riot?</p>
              <p> 　　Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling 
                an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More 
                than ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and 
                second of September, and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard, 
                assembled there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious 
                that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance 
                among the people if after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender 
                of Moscow became certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead 
                of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had 
                taken steps to remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, 
                and money, and had told the population plainly that the town would 
                be abandoned.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine 
                and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative 
                circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed 
                himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy's entry into Smolensk 
                he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the 
                popular feeling of &quot;the heart of Russia.&quot; Not only did 
                it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the 
                external actions of Moscow's inhabitants, but he also thought 
                he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets 
                and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise 
                in their own class and do not understand from those in authority. 
                Rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular 
                feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing 
                that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took 
                him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under 
                his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though 
                he knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly 
                believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for 
                it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government 
                offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials 
                to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the 
                role he had created for himself. As is often the case with those 
                gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had long known that 
                Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect, 
                he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally 
                to this new position of affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it 
                was useful and had any effect on the people is another question) 
                had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own 
                feeling of patriotic hatred of the French.</p>
              <p> 　　But when events assumed their true historical character, when 
                expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, 
                when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting 
                a battle, when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to 
                the one question before Moscow, when the whole population streamed 
                out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their belongings and proving 
                by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling, 
                then the role chosen by Rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless. 
                He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with 
                no ground to stand on.</p>
              <p> 　　When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory 
                note from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt 
                himself to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge 
                of, the state property which he should have removed, was still 
                in Moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it 
                away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such 
                a pass?&quot; he ruminated. &quot;Not I, of course. I had everything 
                ready. I had Moscow <br>
                firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains! 
                Traitors!&quot; he thought, without clearly defining who the villains 
                and traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors 
                whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous 
                position in which he found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　All that night Count Rostopchin issued orders, for which people 
                came to him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never 
                seen the count so morose and irritable.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar's Department 
                has sent for instructions... From the Consistory, from the Senate, 
                from the University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan 
                has sent... asking for information.... What are your orders about 
                the Fire Brigade? From the governor of the prison... from the 
                superintendent of the lunatic asylum...&quot; All night long such 
                announcements were continually being received by the count.</p>
              <p> 　　To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating 
                that orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, 
                carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and 
                that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility 
                for all that might happen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, tell that blockhead,&quot; he said in reply to the 
                question from the Registrar's Department, &quot;that he should 
                remain to guard his documents. Now why are you asking silly questions 
                about the Fire Brigade? They have horses, let them be off to Vladimir, 
                and not leave them to the French.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum 
                has come: what are your commands?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My commands? Let them go away, that's all.... And let 
                the lunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies 
                God evidently means these other madmen to be free.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count 
                Rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you expect me to give you two battalions- which we 
                have not got- for a convoy? Release them, that's all about it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, 
                Meshkov, Vereshchagin...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vereshchagin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?&quot; shouted 
                Rostopchin. &quot;Bring him to me!&quot; </p>

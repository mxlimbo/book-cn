              <p> 　　One matter connected with his management sometimes worried 
                Nicholas, and that was his quick temper together with his old 
                hussar habit of making free use of his fists. At first he saw 
                nothing reprehensible in this, but in the second year of his marriage 
                his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed.</p>
              <p> 　　Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, 
                a man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was 
                accused of dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went 
                out into the porch to question him, and immediately after the 
                elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were 
                heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas went up to his wife, who 
                sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame, and as usual 
                began to tell her what he had been doing that morning. Among other 
                things he spoke of the Bogucharovo elder. Countess Mary turned 
                red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and lips 
                compressed and gave her husband no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Such an insolent scoundrel!&quot; he cried, growing 
                hot again at the mere recollection of him. &quot;If he had told 
                me he was drunk and did not see... But what is the matter with 
                you, Mary?&quot; he suddenly asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily 
                looked down again and her lips puckered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when 
                she was in tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always 
                from sorrow or pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired 
                an irresistible charm.</p>
              <p> 　　The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain 
                herself and began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... 
                Nicholas!&quot; and she covered her face with her hands.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, 
                and paced up and down the room. He understood what she was weeping 
                about, but could not in his heart at once agree with her that 
                what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event 
                was wrong. &quot;Is it just sentimentality, old wives' tales, 
                or is she right?&quot; he asked himself. Before he had solved 
                that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain, 
                and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long 
                been sinning against himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary,&quot; he said softly, going up to her, &quot;it 
                will never happen again; I give you my word. Never,&quot; he repeated 
                in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　The tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes. She 
                took his hand and kissed it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?&quot; 
                she asked to change the subject, looking at his finger on which 
                he wore a ring with a cameo of Laocoon's head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Today- it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don't remind 
                me of it!&quot; and again he flushed. &quot;I give you my word 
                of honor it shan't occur again, and let this always be a reminder 
                to me,&quot; and he pointed to the broken ring.</p>
              <p> 　　After that, when in discussions with his village elders or 
                stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, 
                Nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop 
                his eyes before the man who was making him angry. But he did forget 
                himself once or twice within a twelvemonth, and then he would 
                go and confess to his wife, and would again promise that this 
                should really be the very last time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary, you must despise me!&quot; he would say. &quot;I 
                deserve it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You should go, go away at once, if you don't feel strong 
                enough to control yourself,&quot; she would reply sadly, trying 
                to comfort her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but 
                not liked. He did not concern himself with the interests of his 
                own class, and consequently some thought him proud and others 
                thought him stupid. The whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, 
                he was busy with the work on his farm. In autumn he gave himself 
                up to hunting with the same business like seriousness- leaving 
                home for a month, or even two, with his hunt. In winter he visited 
                his other villages or spent his time reading. The books he read 
                were chiefly historical, and on these he spent a certain sum every 
                year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious library, and he 
                made it a rule to read through all the books he bought. He would 
                sit in his study with a grave air, reading- a task he first imposed 
                upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit affording 
                him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied 
                with serious matters. In winter, except for business excursions, 
                he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his 
                family and entering into all the details of his children's relations 
                with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer 
                and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　From the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. 
                Before that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between 
                himself and Sonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had 
                asked Princess Mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly 
                realized the wrong he had done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward 
                her, and imagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. 
                She could not find fault with Sonya in any way and tried to be 
                fond of her, but often felt ill-will toward her which she could 
                not overcome.</p>
              <p> 　　Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and 
                about her own injustice toward her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know,&quot; said Natasha, &quot;you have read the 
                Gospels a great deal- there is a passage in them that just fits 
                Sonya.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot; asked Countess Mary, surprised.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'To him that hath shall be given, and from him that 
                hath not shall be taken away.' You remember? She is one that hath 
                not; why, I don't know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don't know, 
                but from her is taken away, and everything has been taken away. 
                Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much 
                wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had a sort of presentiment 
                that it would not come off. She is a sterile flower, you know- 
                like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and 
                sometimes I think she doesn't feel it as you or I would.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though Countess Mary told Natasha that those words in the 
                Gospel must be understood differently, yet looking at Sonya she 
                agreed with Natasha's explanation. It really seemed that Sonya 
                did not feel her position trying, and had grown quite reconciled 
                to her lot as a sterile flower. She seemed to be fond not so much 
                of individuals as of the family as a whole. Like a cat, she had 
                attached herself not to the people but to the home. She waited 
                on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always 
                ready to render the small services for which she had a gift, and 
                all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient 
                gratitude.</p>
              <p> 　　The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not 
                on the same scale as under the old prince.</p>
              <p> 　　The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were 
                more than simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations 
                was of wood, plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and 
                was furnished with very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, 
                and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own 
                birchwood. The house was spacious and had rooms for the house 
                serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole families of the Rostovs' 
                and Bolkonskis' relations sometimes came to Bald Hills with sixteen 
                horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months. Besides that, 
                four times a year, on the name days and birthdays of the hosts, 
                as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or 
                two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with 
                its ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, 
                and suppers, provided out of the produce of the estate. </p>

              <p> 　　 To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct.</p>
              <p> 　　It almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in England 
                by the word &quot;respectable.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It is proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might 
                almost say as though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a 
                tradesman who has become a councillor of state. One can almost 
                see distinctly there.</p>
              <p> 　　The mire there comports itself with decency.</p>
              <p> 　　At first, one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean 
                corridors, which were so common in former days, and so useful 
                in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times, &quot;when 
                the people loved their kings.&quot; The present sewer is a beautiful 
                sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical rectilinear 
                alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to have taken 
                refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of that 
                long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue 
                de Rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere, it 
                is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, everything 
                should be subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, 
                assumed a certain official aspect. The very police reports, of 
                which it sometimes forms the subject, no longer are wanting in 
                respect towards it.</p>
              <p> 　　The words which characterize it in administrative language 
                are sonorous and dignified. What used to be called a gut is now 
                called a gallery; what used to be called a hole is now called 
                a surveying orifice.</p>
              <p> 　　Villon would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional 
                lodging. This net-work of cellars has its immemorial population 
                of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbers than ever; from 
                time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window 
                of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin 
                grow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace.</p>
              <p> 　　The cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity.</p>
              <p> 　　The rain, which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to it.</p>
              <p> 　　Miasmas still inhabit it. It is more hypocritical than irreproachable.</p>
              <p> 　　The prefecture of police and the commission of health have 
                done their best. But, in spite of all the processes of disinfection, 
                it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like Tartuffe after confession.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping 
                is a homage which the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from 
                this point of view, Tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the 
                Augean stables, it is certain that the sewers of Paris have been 
                improved.</p>
              <p> 　　It is more than progress; it is transmutation.</p>
              <p> 　　Between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　What has effected this revolution?</p>
              <p> 　　The man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned, 
                Bruneseau.</p>

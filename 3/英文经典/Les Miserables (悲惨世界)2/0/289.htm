              <p> 　　FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS</p>
              <p> 　　The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to 
                the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him 
                the effect of the voice of destiny.</p>
              <p> 　　He wished to die; the opportunity presented itself; he knocked 
                at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness offered him the 
                key.</p>
              <p> 　　These melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before 
                despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which had so 
                often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid 
                in his brain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate 
                after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and 
                love, overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair, he had 
                but one desire remaining, to make a speedy end of all.</p>
              <p> 　　He set out at rapid pace.</p>
              <p> 　　He found himself most opportunely armed, as he had Javert's 
                pistols with him.</p>
              <p> 　　The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, 
                had vanished from his sight in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, 
                traversed the Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs 
                Elysees, the Place Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The 
                shops were open there, the gas was burning under the arcades, 
                women were making their purchases in the stalls, people were eating 
                ices in the Cafe Laiter, and nibbling small cakes at the English 
                pastry-cook's shop.</p>
              <p> 　　Only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from 
                the Hotel des Princes and the Hotel Meurice.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme. 
                There the shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front 
                of their half-open doors, people were walking about, the street 
                lanterns were lighted, beginning with the first floor, all the 
                windows were lighted as usual.</p>
              <p> 　　There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honore. In proportion as he 
                left the Palais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, 
                the shops were fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, 
                the street grew sombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased 
                in density.</p>
              <p> 　　For the passers-by now amounted to a crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　No one could be seen to speak in this throng, and yet there 
                arose from it a dull, deep murmur.</p>
              <p> 　　Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were &quot;assemblages&quot;, 
                motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and 
                came as stones in the midst of running water.</p>
              <p> 　　At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer 
                walked. It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost 
                impenetrable block of people who were huddled together, and conversing 
                in low tones.</p>
              <p> 　　There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock 
                frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This 
                multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings 
                had the hoarse accent of a vibration.</p>
              <p> 　　Although not one of them was walking, a dull trampling was 
                audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, 
                in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension 
                of the Rue Saint-Honore, there was no longer a single window in 
                which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing 
                rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the 
                distance.</p>
              <p> 　　The lanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging 
                to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form 
                of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　There could be descried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and 
                troops bivouacking.</p>
              <p> 　　No curious observer passed that limit.</p>
              <p> 　　There circulation ceased.</p>
              <p> 　　There the rabble ended and the army began.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been summoned, he must go.</p>
              <p> 　　He found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac 
                of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the sentinels.</p>
              <p> 　　He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Bethisy, and directed 
                his course towards the Halles.</p>
              <p> 　　At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais, there were no longer 
                any lanterns.</p>
              <p> 　　After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the 
                limits of the troops; he found himself in something startling.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no longer a passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer 
                a light, there was no one; solitude, silence, night, I know not 
                what chill which seized hold upon one.</p>
              <p> 　　Entering a street was like entering a cellar.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　He took a few steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Some one passed close to him at a run.</p>
              <p> 　　Was it a man?</p>
              <p> 　　Or a woman?</p>
              <p> 　　Were there many of them? he could not have told. It had passed 
                and vanished.</p>
              <p> 　　Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which 
                he judged to be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this 
                street, he came in contact with an obstacle.</p>
              <p> 　　He extended his hands. It was an overturned wagon; his foot 
                recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stones scattered 
                and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.</p>
              <p> 　　He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other 
                side of the barrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and 
                guided himself along the walls of the houses.</p>
              <p> 　　A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him that he could 
                make out something white in front of him. He approached, it took 
                on a form.</p>
              <p> 　　It was two white horses; the horses of the omnibus harnessed 
                by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random all 
                day from street to street, and had finally halted there, with 
                the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions 
                of men, than man understands the actions of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius left the horses behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　As he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the 
                Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one knows whence, and 
                traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by him, and 
                the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his head 
                over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still 
                to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner 
                of the pillars of the market.</p>
              <p> 　　This shot still betokened life.</p>
              <p> 　　From that instant forth he encountered nothing more.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, Marius pressed forward.</p>

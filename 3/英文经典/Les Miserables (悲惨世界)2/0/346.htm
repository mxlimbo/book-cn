              <p> 　　MARIUS, EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR DOMESTIC 
                WAR</p>
              <p> 　　 For a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive.</p>
              <p> 　　For many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium, 
                and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms, caused more by the shocks 
                of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　He repeated Cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy 
                loquacity of fever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony.</p>
              <p> 　　The extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger, 
                the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become 
                re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill the sick man, under certain 
                atmospheric conditions; at every change of weather, at the slightest 
                storm, the physician was uneasy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Above all things,&quot; he repeated, &quot;let the wounded 
                man be subjected to no emotion.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult, 
                the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having 
                been invented as yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet 
                &quot;as big as the ceiling,&quot; as she put it, for lint.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions 
                and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene. As long as there 
                was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in despair at his grandson's 
                pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor dead.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman 
                with white hair,--such was the description given by the porter,-- 
                came to inquire about the wounded man, and left a large package 
                of lint for the dressings.</p>
              <p> 　　Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after 
                the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather 
                in a dying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer 
                for Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Convalescence began.</p>
              <p> 　　But Marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched 
                out on a long chair, on account of the results called up by the 
                fracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like 
                that which will not close, and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely, 
                to the great annoyance of the sick person.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this long illness and this long convalescence saved 
                him from all pursuit.</p>
              <p> 　　In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public character, 
                which six months will not extinguish.</p>
              <p> 　　Revolts, in the present state of society, are so much the 
                fault of every one, that they are followed by a certain necessity 
                of shutting the eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined 
                doctors to lodge information against the wounded, having outraged 
                public opinion, and not opinion alone, but the King first of all, 
                the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation; and, 
                with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the 
                very act of combat, the councils of war did not dare to trouble 
                any one. So Marius was left in peace.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, 
                and then through every form of ecstasy.</p>
              <p> 　　It was found difficult to prevent his passing every night 
                beside the wounded man; he had his big arm-chair carried to Marius' 
                bedside; he required his daughter to take the finest linen in 
                the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, 
                like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the fine linen, 
                while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him, 
                that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good 
                as coarse linen, nor new linen as old linen.</p>
              <p> 　　He was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which 
                Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself. When the 
                dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aie! aie!&quot; Nothing was more touching than to see 
                him with his gentle, senile palsy, offer the wounded man a cup 
                of his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed the doctor with questions.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was 
                out of danger, the good man was in a delirium.</p>
              <p> 　　He made his porter a present of three louis.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danced 
                a gavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he 
                sang the following song:&quot;Jeanne est nee a Fougere &quot;Amour, 
                tu vis en elle; </p>
              <p> 　　 Vrai nid d'une bergere;</p>
              <p> 　　 Car c'est dans sa prunelle </p>
              <p> 　　 J'adore son jupon,Que tu mets ton carquois. </p>
              <p> 　　 Fripon.</p>
              <p> 　　 Narquois!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Moi, je la chante, et j'aime, Plus que Diane meme, Jeanne 
                et ses durs tetons Bretons.&quot;[61][61] &quot;Jeanne was born 
                at Fougere, a true shepherd's nest; I adore her petticoat, the 
                rogue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Love, thou dwellest in her; For 'tis in her eyes that 
                thou placest thy quiver, sly scamp!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As for me, I sing her, and I love, more than Diana herself, 
                Jeanne and her firm Breton breasts.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 Then he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching 
                him through the half-open door, made sure that he was praying.</p>
              <p> 　　Up to that time, he had not believed in God.</p>
              <p> 　　At each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more 
                and more pronounced, the grandfather raved.</p>
              <p> 　　He executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy; 
                he ascended and descended the stairs, without knowing why.</p>
              <p> 　　A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving 
                a big bouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it to her.</p>
              <p> 　　The husband made a jealous scene.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand tried to draw Nicolette upon his knees.</p>
              <p> 　　He called Marius, &quot;M. le Baron.&quot; He shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Long live the Republic!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Every moment, he kept asking the doctor:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he no longer in danger?&quot; He gazed upon Marius 
                with the eyes of a grandmother.</p>
              <p> 　　He brooded over him while he ate.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himself an 
                account of himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was the master of the house, there was abdication in 
                his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.</p>
              <p> 　　In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most 
                venerable of children.</p>
              <p> 　　In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent, 
                he stepped behind him to smile.</p>
              <p> 　　He was content, joyous, delighted, charming, young.</p>
              <p> 　　His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance 
                of his visage.</p>
              <p> 　　When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it is adorable.</p>
              <p> 　　There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age.</p>
              <p> 　　As for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and 
                care for him, he had but one fixed idea:</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　After the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again 
                pronounce her name, and it might have been supposed that he no 
                longer thought of her.</p>
              <p> 　　He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair 
                of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows 
                that were almost indistinct, floated through his mind, Eponine, 
                Gavroche, Mabeuf, the Thenardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled 
                with the smoke of the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent 
                through that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle 
                in a tempest; he understood nothing connected with his own life, 
                he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved, and no one 
                of those around him knew this; all that they had been able to 
                tell him was, that he had been brought home at night in a hackney-coach, 
                to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; past, present, future were 
                nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea; but in that 
                fog there was one immovable point, one clear and precise outline, 
                something made of granite, a resolution, a will; to find Cosette 
                once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from the 
                idea of Cosette. He had decreed in his heart that he would not 
                accept the one without the other, and he was immovably resolved 
                to exact of any person whatever, who should desire to force him 
                to live,--from his grandfather, from fate, from hell,--the restitution 
                of his vanished Eden.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and 
                was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of 
                his grandfather. In the first place, he was not in the secret; 
                then, in his reveries of an invalid, which were still feverish, 
                possibly, he distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel 
                thing, which had for its object his conquest.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained cold.</p>
              <p> 　　The grandfather absolutely <br>
                wasted his poor old smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he, 
                Marius, did not speak, and let things take their course; but that 
                when it became a question of Cosette, he would find another face, 
                and that his grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked.</p>
              <p> 　　Then there would be an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of 
                family questions, a confrontation of positions, every sort of 
                sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time, 
                Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about his 
                neck, the future.</p>
              <p> 　　Violent resistance; conclusion:</p>
              <p> 　　a refusal. Marius stiffened himself in advance.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers 
                of his memory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, 
                Colonel Pontmercy placed himself once more between M. Gillenormand 
                and him, Marius, he told himself that he had no true kindness 
                to expect from a person who had been so unjust and so hard to 
                his father. And with health, there returned to him a sort of harshness 
                towards his grandfather.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand, without 
                however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever since 
                the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness, 
                had not once called him father. It is true that he did not say 
                &quot;monsieur&quot; to him; but he contrived not to say either 
                the one or the other, by means of a certain way of turning his 
                phrases.</p>
              <p> 　　Obviously, a crisis was approaching.</p>
              <p> 　　As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished 
                before giving battle, by way of proving himself.</p>
              <p> 　　This is called &quot;feeling the ground.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly 
                of the Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into 
                his hands, and gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste 
                and Robespierre.--&quot;The men of '93 were giants,&quot; said 
                Marius with severity.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during 
                the remainder of that day.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible 
                grandfather of his early years, interpreted this silence as a 
                profound concentration of wrath, augured from it a hot conflict, 
                and augmented his preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses 
                of his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　He decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his 
                bandages, dislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all 
                the wounds which he had left, and would reject all food.</p>
              <p> 　　His wounds were his munitions of war.</p>
              <p> 　　He would have Cosette or die.</p>
              <p> 　　He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience 
                of the sick.</p>
              <p> 　　That moment arrived.</p>

              <p> 　　THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE-FRANC PIECE</p>
              <p> 　　Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must 
                resume his post at his observatory.</p>
              <p> 　　In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age, he had reached 
                the hole in the partition.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked.</p>
              <p> 　　The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious 
                aspect, and Marius found an explanation of the singular light 
                which he had noticed.</p>
              <p> 　　A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, 
                but that was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was 
                completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather 
                large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled 
                with burning charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman 
                that morning.</p>
              <p> 　　The charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue 
                flame flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of 
                the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where 
                it had been thrust into the brazier to heat.</p>
              <p> 　　In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared for some 
                definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the 
                one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes.</p>
              <p> 　　All this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing 
                of what was in preparation, to waver between a very sinister and 
                a very simple idea.</p>
              <p> 　　The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth 
                of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a 
                demon than of a smith.</p>
              <p> 　　The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the 
                table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping 
                over. An old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned 
                Cartouche, stood on the chimney-piece.</p>
              <p> 　　The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly 
                extinct brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no 
                odor.</p>
              <p> 　　The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast 
                its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the 
                poetic spirit of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of 
                action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen 
                reveries of earth.</p>
              <p> 　　A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, 
                helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the 
                presence of the brazier.</p>
              <p> 　　The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have 
                said of the Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the 
                theatre of a violent and sombre deed, and as the envelope for 
                a crime. It was the most retired chamber in the most isolated 
                house on the most deserted boulevard in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed, 
                they would have been invented there.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited 
                rooms separated this den from the boulevard, and the only window 
                that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless 
                chair, and was engaged in smoking.</p>
              <p> 　　His wife was talking to him in a low tone.</p>
              <p> 　　If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those 
                men who laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with 
                laughter when his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman.</p>
              <p> 　　She had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats 
                of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X., an immense 
                tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the man's shoes which 
                her daughter had scorned in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　It was this toilette which had extracted from Jondrette the 
                exclamation:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good!</p>
              <p> 　　You have dressed up. You have done well.</p>
              <p> 　　You must inspire confidence!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which 
                was too large for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and 
                his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers 
                which constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way!</p>
              <p> 　　Now that I think of it.</p>
              <p> 　　In this weather, he will come in a carriage.</p>
              <p> 　　Light the lantern, take it and go down stairs. You will stand 
                behind the lower door.</p>
              <p> 　　The very moment that you hear the carriage stop, you will 
                open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the 
                staircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will 
                go down stairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the 
                coachman, and dismiss the fiacre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And the money?&quot; inquired the woman.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five 
                francs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's this?&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette replied with dignity:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this 
                morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know what?</p>
              <p> 　　Two chairs will be needed here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To sit on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing 
                this mild answer from Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pardieu!</p>
              <p> 　　I'll go and get one of our neighbor's.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, 
                and went out into the corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, 
                reach his bed, and conceal himself beneath it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take the candle,&quot; cried Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; said she, &quot;it would embarrass me, I have 
                the two chairs to carry. There is moonlight.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his 
                lock in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　The door opened.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror.</p>
              <p> 　　The Jondrette entered.</p>
              <p> 　　The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight 
                between two blocks of shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against 
                which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.</p>
              <p> 　　Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took 
                the two chairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went 
                away, letting the door fall heavily to behind her.</p>
              <p> 　　She re-entered the lair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here are the two chairs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And here is the lantern.</p>
              <p> 　　Go down as quick as you can.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.</p>
              <p> 　　He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned 
                the chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old 
                screen which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner 
                where lay the pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine 
                something. Marius then recognized the fact, that what he had taken 
                for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden 
                rungs and two hooks with which to attach it.</p>
              <p> 　　This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, 
                which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, 
                had not been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently 
                been brought thither in the afternoon, during Marius' absence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,&quot; 
                thought Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would 
                have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool 
                maker, certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, 
                and others which will cut or slice, the two families of tools 
                which burglars call cadets and fauchants.</p>
              <p> 　　The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. 
                The brazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now 
                furnished by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table 
                or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　There was something indescribably calm, threatening, and hideous 
                about this chamber. One felt that there existed in it the anticipation 
                of something terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of 
                preoccupation, and had again seated himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his 
                countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right 
                hand, as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre 
                inward monologue.</p>
              <p> 　　In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making 
                to himself, he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took 
                out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there, and tried 
                the edge of its blade on his nail.</p>
              <p> 　　That done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, 
                drew it out and cocked it.</p>
              <p> 　　The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began 
                to laugh and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a fool I am!</p>
              <p> 　　It's the partition cracking!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius kept the pistol in his hand.</p>

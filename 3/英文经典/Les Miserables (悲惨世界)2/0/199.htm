              <p> 　　MINES AND MINERS </p>
              <p> 　　Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, 
                a third lower floor.</p>
              <p> 　　The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for good, 
                sometimes for evil.</p>
              <p> 　　These works are superposed one upon the other.</p>
              <p> 　　There are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top 
                and a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way 
                beneath civilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness 
                trample under foot.</p>
              <p> 　　The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was 
                almost open to the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive Christianity, 
                only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under 
                the Caesars and to inundate the human race with light.</p>
              <p> 　　For in the sacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes 
                are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth. Every 
                form begins by being night.</p>
              <p> 　　The catacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not 
                alone the cellar of Rome, they were the vaults of the world.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of 
                a structure, there are excavations of all sorts.</p>
              <p> 　　There is the religious mine, the philosophical mine, the economic 
                mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and such a pick-axe with the 
                idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another with wrath.</p>
              <p> 　　People hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another.</p>
              <p> 　　Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they 
                branch out in every direction.</p>
              <p> 　　They sometimes meet, and fraternize there.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his 
                lantern.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes Socinius 
                by the hair.</p>
              <p> 　　But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these 
                energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, 
                which goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these 
                obscurities, and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms 
                the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside.</p>
              <p> 　　Society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its 
                surface intact and changes its bowels.</p>
              <p> 　　There are as many different subterranean stages as there are 
                varying works, as there are extractions.</p>
              <p> 　　What emerges from these deep excavations? The future.</p>
              <p> 　　The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. 
                The work is good, up to a degree which the social philosophies 
                are able to recognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; 
                lower down, it becomes terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer penetrable 
                by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man has 
                been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.</p>
              <p> 　　The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the 
                rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can 
                find foothold, and where one encounters one of these workmen, 
                sometimes divine, sometimes misshapen.</p>
              <p> 　　Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there is Descartes; 
                below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there is Condorcet; 
                below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre, there 
                is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on.</p>
              <p> 　　Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct 
                from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps 
                do not exist as yet.</p>
              <p> 　　The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are 
                forms.</p>
              <p> 　　The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely.</p>
              <p> 　　The embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of 
                philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　A world in limbo, in the state of foetus, what an unheard-of 
                spectre!</p>
              <p> 　　Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.</p>
              <p> 　　Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves, 
                binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, 
                think themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary 
                greatly, and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others.</p>
              <p> 　　The first are paradisiacal, the last are tragic.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, 
                from the highest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the 
                most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it:</p>
              <p> 　　disinterestedness.</p>
              <p> 　　Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They throw themselves on 
                one side, they omit themselves, they think not of themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute.</p>
              <p> 　　The first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical 
                though he may be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam 
                of the infinite.</p>
              <p> 　　Venerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign--the 
                starry eye.</p>
              <p> 　　The shadowy eye is the other sign.</p>
              <p> 　　With it, evil commences.</p>
              <p> 　　Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who has no 
                glance at all.</p>
              <p> 　　The social order has its black miners.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and 
                where light becomes extinct.</p>
              <p> 　　Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below 
                all these galleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous 
                system of progress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much 
                lower than Marat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without 
                any connection with the upper levels, there lies the last mine. 
                A formidable spot.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the grave of shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the cellar of the blind.</p>
              <p> 　　Inferi.</p>
              <p> 　　This communicates with the abyss.</p>
            　　MINES AND MINERS 
              <p> 　　Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, 
                a third lower floor.</p>
              <p> 　　The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for good, 
                sometimes for evil.</p>

              <p> 　　THE VULTURE BECOME PREY</p>
              <p> 　　 We must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades. 
                Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the 
                streets should be omitted.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which 
                we have just mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside 
                it, remains, none the less, a vision.</p>
              <p> 　　There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the 
                mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions 
                are sphinxes, and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks 
                he has traversed a dream.</p>
              <p> 　　The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have 
                pointed out in the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; 
                they are both more and less than life.</p>
              <p> 　　On emerging from a barricade, one no longer knows what one 
                has seen there.</p>
              <p> 　　One has been terrible, but one knows it not.</p>
              <p> 　　One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human 
                faces; one's head has been in the light of the future. There were 
                corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours 
                were colossal and seemed hours of eternity.</p>
              <p> 　　One has lived in death.</p>
              <p> 　　Shadows have passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　What were they?</p>
              <p> 　　One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a 
                deafening horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were 
                open mouths which shouted, and other open mouths which held their 
                peace; one was in the midst of smoke, of night, perhaps.</p>
              <p> 　　One fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown 
                depths; one stares at something red on one's finger nails.</p>
              <p> 　　One no longer remembers anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of 
                a clock striking the hour became audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is midday,&quot; said Combeferre.</p>
              <p> 　　The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras 
                sprang to his feet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled 
                this thundering shout:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills 
                and the roofs with them.</p>
              <p> 　　Half the men to their guns, the other half to the paving-stones. 
                There is not a minute to be lost.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made 
                their appearance in battle array at the end of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? 
                The attacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the 
                demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who 
                are to scale it.</p>
              <p> 　　They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M. 
                Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called &quot;the tug of war.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which 
                is peculiar to ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat 
                where escape is impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which Enjolras 
                had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to 
                the first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had 
                elapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled 
                up the sash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof 
                to half their height.</p>
              <p> 　　A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principal 
                architect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament 
                of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the 
                firing of grape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging 
                ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole 
                there, and, if possible, a breach for the assault.</p>
              <p> 　　When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, 
                Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where 
                Mabeuf lay, carried to the first floor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is to drink that?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet asked him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They,&quot; replied Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness 
                the iron cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop 
                at night.</p>
              <p> 　　The fortress was complete.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop was the dungeon.</p>
              <p> 　　With the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet.</p>
              <p> 　　As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing 
                of their ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants 
                combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, 
                expose themselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more 
                than in reality, and take their ease.</p>
              <p> 　　The preparations for attack are always made with a certain 
                methodical deliberation; after which, the lightning strikes.</p>
              <p> 　　This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything 
                and to perfect everything.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that, since such men were to die, their death ought 
                to be a masterpiece.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to Marius:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are the two leaders.</p>
              <p> 　　I will give the last orders inside.</p>
              <p> 　　Do you remain outside and observe.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the 
                barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, 
                as the reader will remember, nailed up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No splashing of the wounded,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but 
                profoundly tranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the 
                name of all.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut 
                the staircase. Have you them?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Feuilly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How many?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Two axes and a pole-axe.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is good.</p>
              <p> 　　There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. How many 
                guns are there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thirty-four.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eight too many.</p>
              <p> 　　Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand. Swords 
                and pistols in your belts.</p>
              <p> 　　Twenty men to the barricade. Six ambushed in the attic windows, 
                and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants 
                through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not a single worker 
                remain inactive here.</p>
              <p> 　　Presently, when the drum beats the assault, let the twenty 
                below stairs rush to the barricade. The first to arrive will have 
                the best places.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　These arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not forgetting you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, laying a pistol on the table, he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The last man to leave this room will smash the skull 
                of this spy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here?&quot; inquired a voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, let us not mix their corpses with our own.</p>
              <p> 　　The little barricade of the Mondetour lane can be scaled.</p>
              <p> 　　It is only four feet high. The man is well pinioned.</p>
              <p> 　　He shall be taken thither and put to death.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than 
                Enjolras, it was Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been lost among the group of insurgents.</p>
              <p> 　　He stepped forth and said to Enjolras:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are the commander?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You thanked me a while ago.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the name of the Republic.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade has two saviors, Marius Pontmercy and yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you think that I deserve a recompense?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I request one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That I may blow that man's brains out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptible 
                movement, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is just.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut 
                his eyes about him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No objections.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he turned to Jean Valjean:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take the spy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating 
                himself on the end of the table.</p>
              <p> 　　He seized the pistol, and a faint click announced that he 
                had cocked it.</p>
              <p> 　　Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take care!&quot; shouted Marius from the top of the 
                barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was 
                peculiar to him, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said 
                to them:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are in no better case than I am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All out!&quot; shouted Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, 
                received in the back,--may we be permitted the expression,-- this 
                sally of Javert's:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall meet again shortly!&quot;</p>

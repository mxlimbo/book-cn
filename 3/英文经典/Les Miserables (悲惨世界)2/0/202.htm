              <p> 　　 These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like 
                a serpent among the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet 
                glances &quot;under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain,&quot; 
                lending each other their names and their traps, hiding in their 
                own shadows, boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each 
                other, stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false 
                nose at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point 
                of consisting of but one individual, sometimes multiplying themselves 
                to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a whole 
                throng.</p>
              <p> 　　These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious 
                robber with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they 
                were that monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of 
                society.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying 
                their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse 
                were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the 
                department of the Seine.</p>
              <p> 　　The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal 
                imaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed.</p>
              <p> 　　They furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter 
                undertook the preparation of the scenery.</p>
              <p> 　　They labored at the stage setting.</p>
              <p> 　　They were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned 
                and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, 
                and which were sufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest 
                of arms, they under-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe 
                of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground 
                tragedies.</p>
              <p> 　　They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour 
                when they woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere.</p>
              <p> 　　There they held their conferences.</p>
              <p> 　　They had twelve black hours before them; they regulated their 
                employment accordingly.</p>
              <p> 　　Patron-Minette,--such was the name which was bestowed in the 
                subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. 
                In the fantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing 
                day by day, Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as 
                entre chien et loup--between dog and wolf--signifies the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　This appellation, Patron-Minette, was probably derived from 
                the hour at which their work ended, the dawn being the vanishing 
                moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians.</p>
              <p> 　　These four men were known under this title. When the President 
                of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and questioned 
                him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, &quot;Who did 
                it?&quot; demanded the President.</p>
              <p> 　　Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical so far as the magistrate 
                was concerned, but clear to the police:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps it was Patron-Minette.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the 
                personages; in the same manner a band can almost be judged from 
                the list of ruffians composing it.</p>
              <p> 　　Here are the appellations to which the principal members of 
                Patron-Minette answered,--for the names have survived in special 
                memoirs.</p>
              <p> 　　Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.</p>
              <p> 　　Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　[There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from interpolating 
                this word.]</p>
              <p> 　　Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.</p>
              <p> 　　Laveuve.</p>
              <p> 　　Finistere.</p>
              <p> 　　Homere-Hogu, a negro.</p>
              <p> 　　Mardisoir.</p>
              <p> 　　(Tuesday evening.)</p>
              <p> 　　Depeche.</p>
              <p> 　　(Make haste.)</p>
              <p> 　　Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl).</p>
              <p> 　　Glorieux, a discharged convict.</p>
              <p> 　　Barrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.</p>
              <p> 　　L'Esplanade-du-Sud.</p>
              <p> 　　Poussagrive.</p>
              <p> 　　Carmagnolet.</p>
              <p> 　　Kruideniers, called Bizarro.</p>
              <p> 　　Mangedentelle.</p>
              <p> 　　(Lace-eater.)</p>
              <p> 　　Les-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)</p>
              <p> 　　Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.</p>
              <p> 　　Etc., etc.</p>
              <p> 　　We pass over some, and not the worst of them.</p>
              <p> 　　These names have faces attached.</p>
              <p> 　　They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one of 
                these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi 
                from the under side of civilization.</p>
              <p> 　　Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, 
                were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. 
                Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by 
                day to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned 
                quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They 
                ran to earth.</p>
              <p> 　　What became of these men?</p>
              <p> 　　They still exist.</p>
              <p> 　　They have always existed. Horace speaks of them:</p>
              <p> 　　Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae, mendici, mimae; and so 
                long as society remains what it is, they will remain what they 
                are.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continually 
                born again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but always 
                identical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are 
                no longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe 
                subsists.</p>
              <p> 　　They always have the same faculties.</p>
              <p> 　　From the vagrant to the tramp, the race is maintained in its 
                purity.</p>
              <p> 　　They divine purses in pockets, they scent out watches in fobs.</p>
              <p> 　　Gold and silver possess an odor for them.</p>
              <p> 　　There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, 
                that they have a &quot;stealable&quot; air.</p>
              <p> 　　These men patiently pursue these bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　They experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of 
                a stranger or of a man from the country.</p>
              <p> 　　These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches 
                a glimpse of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. 
                They do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists; 
                one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the 
                shadows, that they are in no wise distinct from them, that they 
                possess no other soul than the darkness, and that it is only momentarily 
                and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life, 
                that they have separated from the night.</p>
              <p> 　　What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish?</p>
              <p> 　　Light. Light in floods.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from 
                below.</p>

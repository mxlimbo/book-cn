              <p> 　　A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN</p>
              <p> 　　Thus their life clouded over by degrees.</p>
              <p> 　　But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained 
                to them, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and 
                clothing to those who were cold.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to 
                the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their former 
                free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good 
                one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed 
                many little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. 
                It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette 
                den.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance 
                in the pavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with 
                a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed, and very 
                angry, which resembled a burn, and which he explained in some 
                way or other. This wound resulted in his being detained in the 
                house for a month with fever.</p>
              <p> 　　He would not call in a doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　When Cosette urged him, &quot;Call the dog-doctor,&quot; said 
                he.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine 
                an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him, that 
                Jean Valjean felt all his former joy returning, his fears and 
                anxieties dissipating, and he gazed at Cosette, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a good misfortune!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted 
                the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and 
                the back courtyard. She passed nearly all her days beside Jean 
                Valjean and read to him the books which he desired.</p>
              <p> 　　Generally they were books of travel. Jean Valjean was undergoing 
                a new birth; his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays; 
                the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette's coldness,--all 
                these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had reached the 
                point where he said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I imagined all that. I am an old fool.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of 
                the Thenardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it 
                was, had, after a fashion, glided over him unnoticed.</p>
              <p> 　　He had succeeded in making his escape; all trace of him was 
                lost--what more did he care for! he only thought of those wretched 
                beings to pity them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here they are in prison, and henceforth they will be 
                incapacitated for doing any harm,&quot; he thought, &quot;but 
                what a lamentable family in distress!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As for the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette 
                had not referred to it again.</p>
              <p> 　　Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; 
                Cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, 
                in the evening, in the wounded man's humble abode, she warbled 
                melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Spring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of 
                the year, that Jean Valjean said to Cosette:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You never go there; I want you to stroll in it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As you like, father,&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks 
                in the garden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean 
                Valjean, who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence, 
                hardly ever went there.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's wound had created a diversion.</p>
              <p> 　　When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that 
                he was convalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced 
                a contentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturally 
                had it come.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing 
                longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away 
                with it a portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak 
                of summer, fresh as dawn always is, gay like every childhood; 
                a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that 
                it is. In that month, nature has charming gleams which pass from 
                the sky, from the trees, from the meadows and the flowers into 
                the heart of man.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence 
                of that April joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. 
                Insensibly, and without her suspecting the fact, the blackness 
                departed from her spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars 
                at midday.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she 
                did not account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o'clock, 
                after breakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father 
                into the garden for a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing 
                up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps, supporting 
                his left arm for him, she did not perceive that she laughed every 
                moment and that she was happy.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy 
                once more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　What a good wound!&quot; he repeated in a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　And he felt grateful to the Thenardiers.</p>
              <p> 　　His wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone 
                in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting 
                with some adventure.</p>

              <p> 　　JEAN VALJEAN </p>
              <p> 　　That same day, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, Jean 
                Valjean was sitting alone on the back side of one of the most 
                solitary slopes in the Champ-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or 
                from a desire to meditate, or simply in consequence of one of 
                those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves 
                into the existence of every one, he now rarely went out with Cosette. 
                He had on his workman's waistcoat, and trousers of gray linen; 
                and his long-visored cap concealed his countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　He was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, 
                for a time, alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but 
                for the last week or two, anxieties of another nature had come 
                up.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, while walking on the boulevard, he had caught sight 
                of Thenardier; thanks to his disguise, Thenardier had not recognized 
                him; but since that day, Jean Valjean had seen him repeatedly, 
                and he was now certain that Thenardier was prowling about in their 
                neighborhood.</p>
              <p> 　　This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Paris was not tranquil:</p>
              <p> 　　political troubles presented this inconvenient feature, for 
                any one who had anything to conceal in his life, that the police 
                had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and that while seeking 
                to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they might very readily 
                discover a man like Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even 
                France, and go over to England.</p>
              <p> 　　He had warned Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He wished to set out before the end of the week.</p>
              <p> 　　He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning 
                over all sorts of thoughts in his mind,--Thenardier, the police, 
                the journey, and the difficulty of procuring a passport.</p>
              <p> 　　He was troubled from all these points of view.</p>
              <p> 　　Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted 
                his attention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added 
                to his state of alarm.</p>
              <p> 　　On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household 
                was stirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's shutters 
                were open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following 
                line, engraved, probably with a nail:--</p>
              <p> 　　16 Rue de la Verrerie.</p>
              <p> 　　This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black 
                mortar were white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was 
                powdered with the fine, fresh plaster.</p>
              <p> 　　This had probably been written on the preceding night.</p>
              <p> 　　What was this?</p>
              <p> 　　A signal for others?</p>
              <p> 　　A warning for himself?</p>
              <p> 　　In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, 
                and that strangers had made their way into it.</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the 
                household.</p>
              <p> 　　His mind was now filling in this canvas.</p>
              <p> 　　He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written 
                on the wall, for fear of alarming her.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow 
                cast by the sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the 
                slope immediately behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded 
                in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over 
                his head.</p>
              <p> 　　He took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written 
                in large characters, with a pencil:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one 
                on the slope; he gazed all around him and perceived a creature 
                larger than a child, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse 
                and trousers of dust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over 
                the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the Champde-Mars.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.</p>

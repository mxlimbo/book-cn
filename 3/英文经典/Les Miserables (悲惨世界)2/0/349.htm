              <p> 　　DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY</p>
              <p> 　　 The reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating 
                a lengthy explanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu 
                affair, had been able, thanks to his first escape of a few days' 
                duration, to come to Paris and to withdraw in season, from the 
                hands of Laffitte, the sum earned by him, under the name of Monsieur 
                Madeleine, at Montreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might 
                be recaptured,-- which eventually happened--he had buried and 
                hidden that sum in the forest of Montfermeil, in the locality 
                known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six hundred and thirty thousand 
                francs, all in bank-bills, was not very bulky, and was contained 
                in a box; only, in order to preserve the box from dampness, he 
                had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings.</p>
              <p> 　　In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, the 
                Bishop's candlesticks.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks 
                when he made his escape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one 
                evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went 
                to get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have 
                mentioned.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place 
                known to himself alone.</p>
              <p> 　　When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour 
                was at hand, when that money might prove of service, he had gone 
                to get it; it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the 
                woods, but on this occasion, in the morning instead of in the 
                evening.</p>
              <p> 　　Boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe.</p>
              <p> 　　The actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, 
                five hundred francs.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.--&quot;We 
                shall see hereafter,&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　The difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty 
                thousand francs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure 
                in ten years, from 1823 to 1833.</p>
              <p> 　　The five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five 
                thousand francs.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, 
                where they glittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. 
                The story had been told in his presence, and he had verified the 
                fact in the Moniteur, how a police inspector named Javert had 
                been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses, 
                between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing 
                left by this man, otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed 
                by his superiors, pointed to a fit of mental aberration and a 
                suicide.--&quot;In fact,&quot; thought Jean Valjean, &quot;since 
                he left me at liberty, once having got me in his power, he must 
                have been already mad.&quot;</p>

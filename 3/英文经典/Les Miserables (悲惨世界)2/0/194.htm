              <p> 　　On the following day, Ma'am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the 
                old portress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, 
                Ma'am Bougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we 
                have found out, but this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,-- 
                Ma'am Bougon observed, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going 
                out again in his new coat.</p>
              <p> 　　He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further 
                than his bench midway of the alley.</p>
              <p> 　　He seated himself there, as on the preceding day, surveying 
                from a distance, and clearly making out, the white bonnet, the 
                black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir from 
                it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded 
                that they had quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l'Ouest. 
                Later on, several weeks afterwards, when he came to think it over, 
                he could never recall where he had dined that evening.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day, which was the third, Ma'am Bougon was 
                thunderstruck.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius went out in his new coat. &quot;Three days in succession!&quot; 
                she exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　She tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with 
                immense strides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit 
                of a chamois. She lost sight of him in two minutes, and returned 
                breathless, three-quarters choked with asthma, and furious.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If there is any sense,&quot; she growled, &quot;in putting 
                on one's best clothes every day, and making people run like this!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　The young girl was there with M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius approached as near as he could, pretending to be busy 
                reading a book, but he halted afar off, then returned and seated 
                himself on his bench, where he spent four hours in watching the 
                house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and who produced 
                on him the impression that they were making sport of him.</p>
              <p> 　　A fortnight passed thus.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for the sake of strolling 
                there, but to seat himself always in the same spot, and that without 
                knowing why.</p>
              <p> 　　Once arrived there, he did not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　He put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not 
                showing himself, and he began all over again on the morrow.</p>
              <p> 　　She was decidedly a marvellous beauty.</p>
              <p> 　　The only remark approaching a criticism, that could be made, 
                was, that the contradiction between her gaze, which was melancholy, 
                and her smile, which was merry, gave a rather wild effect to her 
                face, which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become 
                strange without ceasing to be charming.</p>

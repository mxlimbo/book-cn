              <p> 　　Marius had not left the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　He paid no attention to any one there.</p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants 
                in the house, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he 
                had once paid, without, moreover, ever having spoken to either 
                father, mother, or daughters.</p>
              <p> 　　The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had been 
                turned out in default of payment.</p>
              <p> 　　One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little 
                in the afternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient 
                Candlemas day whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks' 
                cold spell, inspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which 
                have with justice remained classic:-- </p>
              <p> 　　 Qu'il luise ou qu'il luiserne, </p>
              <p> 　　 L'ours rentre dans en sa caverne.[26]</p>
              <p> 　　[26] Whether the sun shines brightly or dim, the bear returns 
                to his cave.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had just emerged from his:</p>
              <p> 　　night was falling.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the hour for his dinner; for he had been obliged to 
                take to dining again, alas! oh, infirmities of ideal passions!</p>
              <p> 　　He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma'am Bougon was 
                sweeping at the moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is there that is cheap now?</p>
              <p> 　　Everything is dear.</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble; 
                you can get that for nothing, the trouble of the world!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, 
                in order to reach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along 
                with drooping head.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled 
                round, and saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and 
                slim, the other a little shorter, who were passing rapidly, all 
                out of breath, in terror, and with the appearance of fleeing; 
                they had been coming to meet him, had not seen him, and had jostled 
                him as they passed. Through the twilight, Marius could distinguish 
                their livid faces, their wild heads, their dishevelled hair, their 
                hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats, and their bare feet.</p>
              <p> 　　They were talking as they ran.</p>
              <p> 　　The taller said in a very low voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The bobbies have come.</p>
              <p> 　　They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.&quot; The other 
                answered:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I saw them.</p>
              <p> 　　I bolted, bolted, bolted!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes 
                or the police had come near apprehending these two children, and 
                that the latter had escaped.</p>
              <p> 　　They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, 
                and there created, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of 
                vague white spot, then disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had halted for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a 
                little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　He stooped and picked it up.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;those unhappy 
                girls dropped it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he 
                reflected that they must already be far away, put the package 
                in his pocket, and went off to dine.</p>
              <p> 　　On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child's 
                coffin, covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and 
                illuminated by a candle.</p>
              <p> 　　The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Poor mothers!&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is one thing sadder than to see one's children 
                die; it is to see them leading an evil life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished 
                from his thoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual 
                preoccupations.</p>
              <p> 　　He fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and 
                happiness in the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the 
                beautiful trees of Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How gloomy my life has become!&quot; he said to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Young girls are always appearing to me, only formerly 
                they were angels and now they are ghouls.&quot;</p>

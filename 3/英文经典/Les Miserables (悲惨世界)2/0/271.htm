              <p> 　　THE ROOT OF THE MATTER</p>
              <p> 　　 There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a 
                thing as insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; 
                one is in the wrong, the other is in the right.</p>
              <p> 　　In democratic states, the only ones which are founded on justice, 
                it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps; then the whole 
                rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far 
                as resort to arms.</p>
              <p> 　　In all questions which result from collective sovereignty, 
                the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection; the 
                attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt; according 
                as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are justly 
                or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the populace, 
                is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendemiaire.</p>
              <p> 　　Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality; the 
                Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true.</p>
              <p> 　　That which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty 
                and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the 
                same in things pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct 
                of the masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. 
                The same fury legitimate when directed against Terray and absurd 
                when directed against Turgot.</p>
              <p> 　　The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the 
                breaking of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of 
                multitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to progress, 
                Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland 
                and stoned,--that is revolt.</p>
              <p> 　　Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against 
                Cicero,--that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,--that 
                is insurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher 
                Columbus,-- this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which 
                Christopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander 
                like Columbus, is finding a world.</p>
              <p> 　　These gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations 
                of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable. Sometimes 
                the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The masses are traitors to the people.</p>
              <p> 　　Is there, for example, anything stranger than that long and 
                bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt, a legitimate chronic 
                revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on the day of salvation, 
                at the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, turns 
                into chouannerie, and, from having been an insurrection against, 
                becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance!</p>
              <p> 　　The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and 
                with a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. &quot;Death 
                to the salt duties,&quot; brings forth, &quot;Long live the King!&quot; 
                The assassins of Saint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of September, 
                the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the 
                assassins of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, 
                Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of 
                Brassard,-- behold an uprising.</p>
              <p> 　　La Vendee is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right 
                in movement is recognizable, it does not always proceed from the 
                trembling of excited masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked 
                bells, all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze.</p>
              <p> 　　The brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing 
                from the shock of progress.</p>
              <p> 　　Show me in what direction you are going.</p>
              <p> 　　Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may grow great. 
                There is no insurrection except in a forward direction.</p>
              <p> 　　Any other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards 
                the rear is a revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence 
                against the human race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part 
                of truth; the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth 
                the spark of right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only 
                their mud. Danton against Louis XIV.</p>
              <p> 　　is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, 
                as Lafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be 
                the most fatal of crimes.</p>
              <p> 　　There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection 
                is often a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.</p>
              <p> 　　Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in 
                power. Polignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the 
                governing powers.</p>
              <p> 　　Insurrection is sometimes resurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　The solution of everything by universal suffrage being an 
                absolutely modern fact, and all history anterior to this fact 
                being, for the space of four thousand years, filled with violated 
                right, and the suffering of peoples, each epoch of history brings 
                with it that protest of which it is capable.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Caesars, there was no insurrection, but there was 
                Juvenal.</p>
              <p> 　　The facit indignatio replaces the Gracchi.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also 
                the man of the Annales.</p>
              <p> 　　We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on his 
                part also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name 
                of the ideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire 
                and casts on Rome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the 
                flaming reflection of the Apocalypse.</p>
              <p> 　　John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we may understand 
                him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writes the 
                Annales is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.</p>
              <p> 　　As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted 
                to match. The work of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; 
                there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which 
                bites.</p>
              <p> 　　Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. 
                A word that is chained is a terrible word.</p>
              <p> 　　The writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed 
                on a nation by its master. From this silence there arises a certain 
                mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals 
                into bronze. The compression of history produces conciseness in 
                the historian. The granite solidity of such and such a celebrated 
                prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.</p>
              <p> 　　Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which 
                are augmentations of force.</p>
              <p> 　　The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficed for Verres, would 
                be blunted on Caligula.</p>
              <p> 　　The less spread of sail in the phrase, the more intensity 
                in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his might.</p>
              <p> 　　The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth, 
                overwhelms as with lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically 
                superposed upon Caesar.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar and Tacitus are 
                two successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously 
                avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the stage, 
                regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great, Tacitus 
                is great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them 
                to clash with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, might strike 
                too hard and be unjust. God does not will it.</p>
              <p> 　　The great wars of Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily 
                destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into 
                Germany,--all this glory covers the Rubicon. There is here a sort 
                of delicacy of the divine justice, hesitating to let loose upon 
                the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, sparing Caesar 
                Tacitus, and according extenuating circumstances to genius.</p>
              <p> 　　Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot 
                of genius.</p>
              <p> 　　There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the 
                moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such 
                reigns, nothing veils the shame; and those who make examples, 
                Tacitus as well as Juvenal, slap this ignominy which cannot reply, 
                in the face, more usefully in the presence of all humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla.</p>
              <p> 　　Under Claudius and under Domitian, there is a deformity of 
                baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant.</p>
              <p> 　　The villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot; 
                a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master 
                is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small; consciences 
                are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under Caracalla, thus 
                it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus, while, from 
                the Roman Senate, under Caesar, there comes nothing but the odor 
                of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the 
                Juvenals; it is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator 
                makes his appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　But Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like 
                Dante in the Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the 
                multitude, which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact; 
                insurrection is always a moral phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　Riot is Masaniello; insurrection, Spartacus.</p>
              <p> 　　Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the stomach; Gaster 
                grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always in the wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, for example, holds 
                a true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it 
                remains a riot.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in form.</p>
              <p> 　　Shy although in the right, violent although strong, it struck 
                at random; it walked like a blind elephant; it left behind it 
                the corpses of old men, of women, and of children; it wished the 
                blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why.</p>
              <p> 　　The nourishment of the people is a good object; to massacre 
                them is a bad means.</p>
              <p> 　　All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of 
                the 10th of August, even that of July 14th, begin with the same 
                troubles. Before the right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. 
                In the beginning, the insurrection is a riot, just as a river 
                is a torrent.</p>
              <p> 　　Ordinarily it ends in that ocean:</p>
              <p> 　　revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those lofty mountains 
                which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason, right, 
                formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from rock 
                to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and 
                increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph, 
                insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is 
                in a swamp.</p>
              <p> 　　All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal 
                suffrage has this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in 
                its inception, and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives 
                it of its arms.</p>
              <p> 　　The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars 
                on the frontiers, such is the inevitable progression.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever To-day may be, To-morrow will be peace.</p>
              <p> 　　However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between 
                the former and the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, 
                knows nothing of such shades.</p>
              <p> 　　In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, the 
                revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom 
                must be punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, 
                until such day as the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined 
                vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the bourgeois shouts:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Long live the people!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, 
                signify, so far as history is concerned?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it a revolt?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it an insurrection?</p>
              <p> 　　It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the 
                stage, to say revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial 
                facts, and always preserving the distinction between revolt, the 
                form, and insurrection, the foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its 
                melancholy extinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see 
                in it only an uprising, never refer to it otherwise than with 
                respect. For them, it is like a relic of 1830.</p>
              <p> 　　Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be calmed in a 
                day.</p>
              <p> 　　A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs undergo 
                some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a 
                mountain sinking into the plain.</p>
              <p> 　　There are no Alps without their Jura, nor Pyrenees without 
                the Asturias.</p>
              <p> 　　This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory 
                of Parisians calls &quot;the epoch of the riots,&quot; is certainly 
                a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century. A 
                last word, before we enter on the recital.</p>
              <p> 　　The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic 
                and living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for 
                lack of time and space.</p>
              <p> 　　There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation, 
                human tremor.</p>
              <p> 　　Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so to 
                speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance 
                of history.</p>
              <p> 　　The epoch, surnamed &quot;of the riots,&quot; abounds in details 
                of this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps 
                have not sounded the depths, for another reason than history.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall therefore bring to light, among the known and published 
                peculiarities, things which have not heretofore been known, about 
                facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some, and the 
                death of others. The majority of the actors in these gigantic 
                scenes have disappeared; beginning with the very next day they 
                held their peace; but of what we shall relate, we shall be able 
                to say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have seen this.&quot; We alter a few names, for history 
                relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we shall 
                paint will be genuine.</p>
              <p> 　　In accordance with the conditions of the book which we are 
                now writing, we shall show only one side and one episode, and 
                certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and 
                the 6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the 
                reader may catch a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are 
                about to lift, of the real form of this frightful public adventure.</p>
            　　THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
              <p> 　　 There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a 
                thing as insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; 
                one is in the wrong, the other is in the right.</p>
              <p> 　　In democratic states, the only ones which are founded on justice, 
                it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps; then the whole 
                rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far 
                as resort to arms.</p>
              <p> 　　In all questions which result from collective sovereignty, 
                the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection; the 
                attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt; according 
                as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are justly 
                or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the populace, 
                is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendemiaire.</p>
              <p> 　　Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality; the 
                Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true.</p>
              <p> 　　That which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty 
                and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the 
                same in things pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct 
                of the masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. 
                The same fury legitimate when directed against Terray and absurd 
                when directed against Turgot.</p>
              <p> 　　The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the 
                breaking of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of 
                multitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to progress, 
                Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland 
                and stoned,--that is revolt.</p>
              <p> 　　Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against 
                Cicero,--that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,--that 
                is insurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher 
                Columbus,-- this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which 
                Christopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander 
                like Columbus, is finding a world.</p>
              <p> 　　These gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations 
                of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable. Sometimes 
                the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The masses are traitors to the people.</p>
              <p> 　　Is there, for example, anything stranger than that long and 
                bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt, a legitimate chronic 
                revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on the day of salvation, 
                at the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, turns 
                into chouannerie, and, from having been an insurrection against, 
                becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance!</p>
              <p> 　　The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and 
                with a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. &quot;Death 
                to the salt duties,&quot; brings forth, &quot;Long live the King!&quot; 
                The assassins of Saint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of September, 
                the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the 
                assassins of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, 
                Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of 
                Brassard,-- behold an uprising.</p>
              <p> 　　La Vendee is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right 
                in movement is recognizable, it does not always proceed from the 
                trembling of excited masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked 
                bells, all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze.</p>
              <p> 　　The brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing 
                from the shock of progress.</p>
              <p> 　　Show me in what direction you are going.</p>
              <p> 　　Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may grow great. 
                There is no insurrection except in a forward direction.</p>
              <p> 　　Any other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards 
                the rear is a revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence 
                against the human race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part 
                of truth; the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth 
                the spark of right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only 
                their mud. Danton against Louis XIV.</p>
              <p> 　　is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, 
                as Lafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be 
                the most fatal of crimes.</p>
              <p> 　　There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection 
                is often a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.</p>
              <p> 　　Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in 
                power. Polignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the 
                governing powers.</p>
              <p> 　　Insurrection is sometimes resurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　The solution of everything by universal suffrage being an 
                absolutely modern fact, and all history anterior to this fact 
                being, for the space of four thousand years, filled with violated 
                right, and the suffering of peoples, each epoch of history brings 
                with it that protest of which it is capable.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Caesars, there was no insurrection, but there was 
                Juvenal.</p>
              <p> 　　The facit indignatio replaces the Gracchi.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also 
                the man of the Annales.</p>
              <p> 　　We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on his 
                part also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name 
                of the ideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire 
                and casts on Rome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the 
                flaming reflection of the Apocalypse.</p>
              <p> 　　John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we may understand 
                him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writes the 
                Annales is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.</p>
              <p> 　　As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted 
                to match. The work of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; 
                there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which 
                bites.</p>
              <p> 　　Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. 
                A word that is chained is a terrible word.</p>
              <p> 　　The writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed 
                on a nation by its master. From this silence there arises a certain 
                mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals 
                into bronze. The compression of history produces conciseness in 
                the historian. The granite solidity of such and such a celebrated 
                prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.</p>
              <p> 　　Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which 
                are augmentations of force.</p>
              <p> 　　The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficed for Verres, would 
                be blunted on Caligula.</p>
              <p> 　　The less spread of sail in the phrase, the more intensity 
                in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his might.</p>
              <p> 　　The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth, 
                overwhelms as with lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically 
                superposed upon Caesar.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar and Tacitus are 
                two successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously 
                avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the stage, 
                regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great, Tacitus 
                is great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them 
                to clash with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, might strike 
                too hard and be unjust. God does not will it.</p>
              <p> 　　The great wars of Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily 
                destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into 
                Germany,--all this glory covers the Rubicon. There is here a sort 
                of delicacy of the divine justice, hesitating to let loose upon 
                the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, sparing Caesar 
                Tacitus, and according extenuating circumstances to genius.</p>
              <p> 　　Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot 
                of genius.</p>
              <p> 　　There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the 
                moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such 
                reigns, nothing veils the shame; and those who make examples, 
                Tacitus as well as Juvenal, slap this ignominy which cannot reply, 
                in the face, more usefully in the presence of all humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla.</p>
              <p> 　　Under Claudius and under Domitian, there is a deformity of 
                baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant.</p>
              <p> 　　The villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot; 
                a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master 
                is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small; consciences 
                are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under Caracalla, thus 
                it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus, while, from 
                the Roman Senate, under Caesar, there comes nothing but the odor 
                of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the 
                Juvenals; it is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator 
                makes his appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　But Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like 
                Dante in the Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the 
                multitude, which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact; 
                insurrection is always a moral phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　Riot is Masaniello; insurrection, Spartacus.</p>
              <p> 　　Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the stomach; Gaster 
                grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always in the wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, for example, holds 
                a true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it 
                remains a riot.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in form.</p>
              <p> 　　Shy although in the right, violent although strong, it struck 
                at random; it walked like a blind elephant; it left behind it 
                the corpses of old men, of women, and of children; it wished the 
                blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why.</p>
              <p> 　　The nourishment of the people is a good object; to massacre 
                them is a bad means.</p>
              <p> 　　All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of 
                the 10th of August, even that of July 14th, begin with the same 
                troubles. Before the right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. 
                In the beginning, the insurrection is a riot, just as a river 
                is a torrent.</p>
              <p> 　　Ordinarily it ends in that ocean:</p>
              <p> 　　revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those lofty mountains 
                which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason, right, 
                formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from rock 
                to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and 
                increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph, 
                insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is 
                in a swamp.</p>
              <p> 　　All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal 
                suffrage has this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in 
                its inception, and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives 
                it of its arms.</p>
              <p> 　　The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars 
                on the frontiers, such is the inevitable progression.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever To-day may be, To-morrow will be peace.</p>
              <p> 　　However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between 
                the former and the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, 
                knows nothing of such shades.</p>
              <p> 　　In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, the 
                revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom 
                must be punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, 
                until such day as the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined 
                vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the bourgeois shouts:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Long live the people!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, 
                signify, so far as history is concerned?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it a revolt?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it an insurrection?</p>
              <p> 　　It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the 
                stage, to say revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial 
                facts, and always preserving the distinction between revolt, the 
                form, and insurrection, the foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its 
                melancholy extinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see 
                in it only an uprising, never refer to it otherwise than with 
                respect. For them, it is like a relic of 1830.</p>
              <p> 　　Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be calmed in a 
                day.</p>
              <p> 　　A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs undergo 
                some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a 
                mountain sinking into the plain.</p>
              <p> 　　There are no Alps without their Jura, nor Pyrenees without 
                the Asturias.</p>
              <p> 　　This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory 
                of Parisians calls &quot;the epoch of the riots,&quot; is certainly 
                a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century. A 
                last word, before we enter on the recital.</p>
              <p> 　　The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic 
                and living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for 
                lack of time and space.</p>
              <p> 　　There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation, 
                human tremor.</p>
              <p> 　　Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so to 
                speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance 
                of history.</p>
              <p> 　　The epoch, surnamed &quot;of the riots,&quot; abounds in details 
                of this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps 
                have not sounded the depths, for another reason than history.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall therefore bring to light, among the known and published 
                peculiarities, things which have not heretofore been known, about 
                facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some, and the 
                death of others. The majority of the actors in these gigantic 
                scenes have disappeared; beginning with the very next day they 
                held their peace; but of what we shall relate, we shall be able 
                to say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have seen this.&quot; We alter a few names, for history 
                relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we shall 
                paint will be genuine.</p>
              <p> 　　In accordance with the conditions of the book which we are 
                now writing, we shall show only one side and one episode, and 
                certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and 
                the 6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the 
                reader may catch a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are

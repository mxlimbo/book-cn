              <p> 　　EXPLANATION</p>
              <p> 　　 On the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had 
                been ordered. It was feared that the vanquished might have taken 
                to them for refuge, and Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris 
                while General Bugeaud swept public Paris; a double and connected 
                operation which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public 
                force, represented above by the army and below by the police.</p>
              <p> 　　Three squads of agents and sewermen explored the subterranean 
                drain of Paris, the first on the right bank, the second on the 
                left bank, the third in the city.</p>
              <p> 　　The agents of police were armed with carabines, with bludgeons, 
                swords and poignards.</p>
              <p> 　　That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was 
                the lantern of the patrol of the right bank.</p>
              <p> 　　This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three 
                blind alleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran.</p>
              <p> 　　While they were passing their lantern through the depths of 
                these blind alleys, Jean Valjean had encountered on his path the 
                entrance to the gallery, had perceived that it was narrower than 
                the principal passage and had not penetrated thither.</p>
              <p> 　　He had passed on.</p>
              <p> 　　The police, on emerging from the gallery du Cadran, had fancied 
                that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the 
                belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern, 
                and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction 
                whence the sound proceeded.</p>
              <p> 　　This was an indescribable moment for Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but 
                ill. It was light and he was shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　He was very far off, and mingled with the darkness of the 
                place.</p>
              <p> 　　He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did not understand 
                what it was that was moving behind him. The lack of sleep and 
                food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state 
                of a visionary.</p>
              <p> 　　He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms.</p>
              <p> 　　What was it?</p>
              <p> 　　He did not comprehend.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.</p>
              <p> 　　The men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked 
                and saw nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　They held a consultation.</p>
              <p> 　　There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre 
                sewer a sort of cross-roads called de service, which was afterwards 
                suppressed, on account of the little interior lake which formed 
                there, swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms. The 
                patrol could form a cluster in this open space.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle.</p>
              <p> 　　These bull-dogs' heads approached each other closely and whispered 
                together.</p>
              <p> 　　The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that 
                they had been mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it 
                was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer, that it would 
                only be a waste of time, but that they ought to hasten towards 
                Saint-Merry; that if there was anything to do, and any &quot;bousingot&quot; 
                to track out, it was in that quarter.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1832, the word bousingot formed the interim between the 
                word jacobin, which had become obsolete, and the word demagogue 
                which has since rendered such excellent service.</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the 
                watershed of the Seine.</p>
              <p> 　　If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and 
                to go in both directions, Jean Valjean would have been captured. 
                All hung on that thread.</p>
              <p> 　　It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture, foreseeing 
                a possibility of combat and insurgents in force, had forbidden 
                the patrol to part company. The patrol resumed its march, leaving 
                Jean Valjean behind it. Of all this movement, Jean Valjean perceived 
                nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled 
                round.</p>
              <p> 　　Before taking his departure, the Sergeant, in order to acquit 
                his policeman's conscience, discharged his gun in the direction 
                of Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like 
                the rumbling of that titanic entrail.</p>
              <p> 　　A bit of plaster which fell into the stream and splashed up 
                the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean, warned him that 
                the ball had struck the arch over his head.</p>
              <p> 　　Slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber 
                work, gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; 
                the group of black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated 
                and floated, communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew 
                fainter, then disappeared; the silence became profound once more, 
                the obscurity became complete, blindness and deafness resumed 
                possession of the shadows; and Jean Valjean, not daring to stir 
                as yet, remained for a long time leaning with his back against 
                the wall, with straining ears, and dilated pupils, watching the 
                disappearance of that phantom patrol.</p>

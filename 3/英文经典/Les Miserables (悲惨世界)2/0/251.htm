              <p> 　　OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY</p>
              <p> 　　 When evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed 
                herself. She arranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and 
                she put on a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors 
                too much, and which, through this slope, permitted a view of the 
                beginning of her throat, and was, as young girls say, &quot;a 
                trifle indecent.&quot; It was not in the least indecent, but it 
                was prettier than usual. She made her toilet thus without knowing 
                why she did so.</p>
              <p> 　　Did she mean to go out?</p>
              <p> 　　No.</p>
              <p> 　　Was she expecting a visitor?</p>
              <p> 　　No.</p>
              <p> 　　At dusk, she went down to the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　Toussaint was busy in her kitchen, which opened on the back 
                yard.</p>
              <p> 　　She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside 
                the branches from time to time with her hand, because there were 
                some which hung very low.</p>
              <p> 　　In this manner she reached the bench.</p>
              <p> 　　The stone was still there.</p>
              <p> 　　She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone 
                as though she wished to caress and thank it.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which 
                one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even 
                when she does not see the person.</p>
              <p> 　　She turned her head and rose to her feet.</p>
              <p> 　　It was he.</p>
              <p> 　　His head was bare.</p>
              <p> 　　He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His black clothes 
                were hardly discernible.</p>
              <p> 　　The twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow, and covered 
                his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness, 
                he had something about him that suggested death and night.</p>
              <p> 　　His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and 
                by the thought of a soul that is taking flight.</p>
              <p> 　　He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.</p>
              <p> 　　He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry.</p>
              <p> 　　She retreated slowly, for she felt herself attracted.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　By virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped 
                him, she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against 
                it. Had it not been for this tree, she would have fallen.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really 
                never heard, barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and 
                murmuring:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pardon me, here I am.</p>
              <p> 　　My heart is full.</p>
              <p> 　　I could not live on as I was living, and I have come.</p>
              <p> 　　Have you read what I placed there on the bench?</p>
              <p> 　　Do you recognize me at all?</p>
              <p> 　　Have no fear of me. It is a long time, you remember the day, 
                since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator.</p>
              <p> 　　And the day when you passed before me?</p>
              <p> 　　It was on the 16th of June and the 2d of July.</p>
              <p> 　　It is nearly a year ago.</p>
              <p> 　　I have not seen you for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she told me 
                that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on 
                the third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,--you 
                see that I know!</p>
              <p> 　　I followed you. What else was there for me to do?</p>
              <p> 　　And then you disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while 
                I was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the Odeon.</p>
              <p> 　　I ran after you.</p>
              <p> 　　But no.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a person who had a bonnet like yours.</p>
              <p> 　　At night I came hither. Do not be afraid, no one sees me.</p>
              <p> 　　I come to gaze upon your windows near at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　I walk very softly, so that you may not hear, for you might 
                be alarmed.</p>
              <p> 　　The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled.</p>
              <p> 　　Once, I heard you singing.</p>
              <p> 　　I was happy. Did it affect you because I heard you singing 
                through the shutters? That could not hurt you.</p>
              <p> 　　No, it is not so?</p>
              <p> 　　You see, you are my angel!</p>
              <p> 　　Let me come sometimes; I think that I am going to die. If 
                you only knew!</p>
              <p> 　　I adore you.</p>
              <p> 　　Forgive me, I speak to you, but I do not know what I am saying; 
                I may have displeased you; have I displeased you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! my mother!&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　And she sank down as though on the point of death.</p>
              <p> 　　He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed 
                her close, without knowing what he was doing.</p>
              <p> 　　He supported her, though he was tottering himself.</p>
              <p> 　　It was as though his brain were full of smoke; lightnings 
                darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to him 
                that he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was 
                committing a profanation.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely woman 
                whose force he felt against his breast. He was beside himself 
                with love.</p>
              <p> 　　She took his hand and laid it on her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt the paper there, he stammered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You love me, then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything 
                more than a barely audible breath:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hush!</p>
              <p> 　　Thou knowest it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb 
                and intoxicated young man.</p>
              <p> 　　He fell upon the bench, and she beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　They had no words more. The stars were beginning to gleam.</p>
              <p> 　　How did it come to pass that their lips met?</p>
              <p> 　　How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, 
                that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white 
                behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?</p>
              <p> 　　A kiss, and that was all.</p>
              <p> 　　Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor 
                the damp earth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, 
                and their hearts were full of thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　They had clasped hands unconsciously.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered 
                there, and how he had made his way into the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed so simple to her that he should be there!</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, and 
                both shivered.</p>
              <p> 　　At intervals, Cosette stammered a word.</p>
              <p> 　　Her soul fluttered on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower.</p>
              <p> 　　Little by little they began to talk to each other.</p>
              <p> 　　Effusion followed silence, which is fulness.</p>
              <p> 　　The night was serene and splendid overhead. These two beings, 
                pure as spirits, told each other everything, their dreams, their 
                intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras, their weaknesses, 
                how they had adored each other from afar, how they had longed 
                for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing 
                could augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　They related to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, 
                all that love, youth, and the remains of childhood which still 
                lingered about them, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts 
                poured themselves out into each other in such wise, that at the 
                expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young man who had 
                the young girl's soul, and the young girl who had the young man's 
                soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Each became permeated with the other, they were enchanted 
                with each other, they dazzled each other.</p>
              <p> 　　When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, 
                she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is Marius,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And yours?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is Cosette.&quot;</p>

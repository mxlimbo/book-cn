              <p> 　　THE LOWER CHAMBER </p>
              <p> 　　On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at 
                the carriage gate of the Gillenormand house.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Basque who received him. Basque was in the courtyard 
                at the appointed hour, as though he had received his orders.</p>
              <p> 　　It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: &quot;You 
                will watch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter 
                to approach him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether 
                monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will remain below,&quot; replied Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the 
                waiting-room and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will go and inform Madame.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room 
                on the ground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which 
                opened on the street, was paved with red squares and was badly 
                lighted by a grated window.</p>
              <p> 　　This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the 
                feather-duster, the pope's head brush, and the broom. The dust 
                rested tranquilly there.</p>
              <p> 　　Persecution of the spiders was not organized there.</p>
              <p> 　　A fine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black 
                and ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. 
                The room, which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a 
                heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner.</p>
              <p> 　　The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was 
                scaling off in large flakes.</p>
              <p> 　　At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with 
                a narrow shelf.</p>
              <p> 　　A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean Valjean's 
                reply:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will remain below,&quot; had been foreseen.</p>
              <p> 　　Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. 
                Between the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation 
                thread than wool, had been spread by way of a carpet.</p>
              <p> 　　The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the 
                twilight falling through the window.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was fatigued.</p>
              <p> 　　For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He threw himself 
                into one of the arm-chairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece 
                and retired. Jean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting 
                on his breast, perceived neither Basque nor the candle.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he drew himself up with a start.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was standing beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　He gazed at her.</p>
              <p> 　　She was adorably lovely. But what he was contemplating with 
                that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; exclaimed Cosette, &quot;father, I knew 
                that you were peculiar, but I never should have expected this.</p>
              <p> 　　What an idea!</p>
              <p> 　　Marius told me that you wish me to receive you here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it is my wish.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I expected that reply.</p>
              <p> 　　Good.</p>
              <p> 　　I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us begin at the beginning.</p>
              <p> 　　Embrace me, father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she offered him her cheek.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean remained motionless.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You do not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　I take note of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Attitude of guilt. But never mind, I pardon you.</p>
              <p> 　　Jesus Christ said:</p>
              <p> 　　Offer the other cheek.</p>
              <p> 　　Here it is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she presented her other cheek.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did not move.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is becoming serious,&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have I done to you? I declare that I am perplexed.</p>
              <p> 　　You owe me reparation.</p>
              <p> 　　You will dine with us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have dined.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is not true.</p>
              <p> 　　I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers are 
                made to reprimand fathers.</p>
              <p> 　　Come.</p>
              <p> 　　Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room. Immediately.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Cosette lost ground a little.</p>
              <p> 　　She ceased to command and passed to questioning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house 
                in which to see me.</p>
              <p> 　　It's horrible here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thou knowest . . .&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean caught himself up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette struck her tiny hands together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties!</p>
              <p> 　　What is the meaning of this?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to 
                which he occasionally had recourse:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You wished to be Madame.</p>
              <p> 　　You are so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not for you, father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do not call me father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Call me `Monsieur Jean.'</p>
              <p> 　　`Jean,' if you like.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are no longer my father?</p>
              <p> 　　I am no longer Cosette? `Monsieur Jean'? What does this mean? 
                why, these are revolutions, aren't they? what has taken place? 
                come, look me in the face. And you won't live with us!</p>
              <p> 　　And you won't have my chamber! What have I done to you?</p>
              <p> 　　Has anything happened?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything is as usual.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why do you change your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have changed yours, surely.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He smiled again with the same smile as before and added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur 
                Jean.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand anything about it.</p>
              <p> 　　All this is idiotic. I shall ask permission of my husband 
                for you to be `Monsieur Jean.' I hope that he will not consent 
                to it.</p>
              <p> 　　You cause me a great deal of pain.</p>
              <p> 　　One does have freaks, but one does not cause one's little 
                Cosette grief.</p>
              <p> 　　That is wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her 
                face with an irresistible movement, she pressed them against her 
                neck beneath her chin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh!&quot; she said to him, &quot;be good!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she went on:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what I call being good:</p>
              <p> 　　being nice and coming and living here,-- there are birds here 
                as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living with us, quitting that 
                hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme, not giving us riddles to guess, 
                being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfasting 
                with us, being my father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He loosed her hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You no longer need a father, you have a husband.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette became angry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I no longer need a father!</p>
              <p> 　　One really does not know what to say to things like that, 
                which are not common sense!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If Toussaint were here,&quot; resumed Jean Valjean, 
                like a person who is driven to seek authorities, and who clutches 
                at every branch, &quot;she would be the first to agree that it 
                is true that I have always had ways of my own.</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing new in this.</p>
              <p> 　　I always have loved my black corner.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it is cold here.</p>
              <p> 　　One cannot see distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　It is abominable, that it is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean!</p>
              <p> 　　I will not have you say `you' to me.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just now, as I was coming hither,&quot; replied Jean 
                Valjean, &quot;I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at a cabinet-maker's. If I were a pretty woman, I would 
                treat myself to that bit of furniture.</p>
              <p> 　　A very neat toilet table in the reigning style.</p>
              <p> 　　What you call rosewood, I think.</p>
              <p> 　　It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large.</p>
              <p> 　　There are drawers.</p>
              <p> 　　It is pretty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hou! the villainous bear!&quot; replied Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　And with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back 
                her lips, she blew at Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　She was a Grace copying a cat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am furious,&quot; she resumed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ever since yesterday, you have made me rage, all of 
                you.</p>
              <p> 　　I am greatly vexed.</p>
              <p> 　　I don't understand.</p>
              <p> 　　You do not defend me against Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius will not uphold me against you. I am all alone.</p>
              <p> 　　I arrange a chamber prettily.</p>
              <p> 　　If I could have put the good God there I would have done it.</p>
              <p> 　　My chamber is left on my hands. My lodger sends me into bankruptcy.</p>
              <p> 　　I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette.</p>
              <p> 　　We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my 
                father Fauchelevent wants me to call him `Monsieur Jean,' and 
                to receive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls 
                have beards, and where the crystal consists of empty bottles, 
                and the curtains are of spiders' webs!</p>
              <p> 　　You are singular, I admit, that is your style, but people 
                who get married are granted a truce. You ought not to have begun 
                being singular again instantly. So you are going to be perfectly 
                contented in your abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme.</p>
              <p> 　　I was very desperate indeed there, that I was. What have you 
                against me?</p>
              <p> 　　You cause me a great deal of grief. Fi!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean 
                Valjean and added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you angry with me because I am happy?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep.</p>
              <p> 　　This question, which was simple for Cosette, was profound 
                for Jean Valjean. Cosette had meant to scratch, and she lacerated.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean turned pale.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible 
                intonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Her happiness was the object of my life.</p>
              <p> 　　Now God may sign my dismissal.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, you have said thou to me!&quot; exclaimed Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　And she sprang to his neck.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his 
                breast. It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thanks, father!&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant 
                for Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He gently removed Cosette's arms, and took his hat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, from the threshold, he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have said thou to you.</p>
              <p> 　　Tell your husband that this shall not happen again.</p>
              <p> 　　Pardon me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at 
                this enigmatical farewell.</p>

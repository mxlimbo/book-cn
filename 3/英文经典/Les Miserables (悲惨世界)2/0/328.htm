              <p> 　　 The sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary.</p>
              <p> 　　In the sixteenth century, Henri II.</p>
              <p> 　　attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred years ago, the 
                cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself, 
                and fared as best it might.</p>
              <p> 　　Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to 
                indecision, and to gropings.</p>
              <p> 　　It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, '89 showed 
                how understanding comes to cities.</p>
              <p> 　　But in the good, old times, the capital had not much head.</p>
              <p> 　　It did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally 
                or materially, and could not sweep out filth any better than it 
                could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle, everything raised 
                a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to every itinerary. 
                One could no more find one's bearings in the sewer than one could 
                understand one's position in the city; above the unintelligible, 
                below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues there 
                reigned the confusion of caverns; Daedalus backed up Babel.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though 
                this misunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. 
                There occurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. 
                At times, that stomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool 
                flowed back into the throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste 
                of her own filth.</p>
              <p> 　　These resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good 
                points; they were warnings; very badly accepted, however; the 
                city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire, and did not 
                admit that the filth should return.</p>
              <p> 　　Drive it out better.</p>
              <p> 　　The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians 
                of the age of eighty.</p>
              <p> 　　The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des Victoires, 
                where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue Saint-Honore 
                by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Elysees, the Rue 
                Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue Pierre-a-Poisson 
                through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt, through 
                the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through 
                the sewer of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue 
                des Champs-Elysees to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, 
                to the South, through the vent of the Seine, performing its functions 
                in inverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l'Echaude, 
                and the Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a distance of one 
                hundred and nine metres, a few paces distant from the house in 
                which Racine had lived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, 
                the poet more than the King. It attained its maximum depth in 
                the Rue Saint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of three feet 
                above the flag-stones of the water-spout, and its maximum length 
                in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it spread out over a stretch two 
                hundred and thirty-eight metres in length.</p>
              <p> 　　At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still 
                a mysterious place.</p>
              <p> 　　Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its evil 
                renown reached the verge of the terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris knew, in a confused way, that she had under her a terrible 
                cavern. People talked of it as of that monstrous bed of Thebes 
                in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length, and which 
                might have served Behemoth for a bathtub.</p>
              <p> 　　The great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than 
                certain well-known points.</p>
              <p> 　　We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's carts, 
                from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis 
                de Crequi, discharged their loads directly into the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　As for cleaning out,-- that function was entrusted to the 
                pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away.</p>
              <p> 　　Rome left some poetry to her sewer, and called it the Gemoniae; 
                Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the Polypus-Hole. Science 
                and superstition were in accord, in horror. The Polypus hole was 
                no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblin was developed 
                under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses 
                of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie; 
                Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the 
                great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning 
                until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of 
                the Gallant Messenger.</p>
              <p> 　　The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated 
                for the pestilences which had their source there; with its grating 
                of iron, with points simulating a row of teeth, it was like a 
                dragon's maw in that fatal street, breathing forth hell upon men.</p>
              <p> 　　The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink 
                with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. 
                The sewer had no bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer was the lower world.</p>
              <p> 　　The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur 
                to the police. To try that unknown thing, to cast the plummet 
                into that shadow, to set out on a voyage of discovery in that 
                abyss--who would have dared? It was alarming.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cess-pool 
                had its Christopher Columbus.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which 
                the Emperor made in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some 
                Decres or Cretet or other, came to the master's intimate levee. 
                In the Carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all 
                those extraordinary soldiers of the great Republic, and of the 
                great Empire; then Napoleon's door was blocked with heroes; men 
                from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the Adige, and from the 
                Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, 
                of Kleber; the aerostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of Mayence, 
                the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had looked 
                down upon, artillerists whom Junot's cannon-ball had spattered 
                with mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying 
                at anchor in the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the 
                bridge of Lodi, others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of 
                Mantua, others had preceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. 
                The whole army of that day was present there, in the court-yard 
                of the Tuileries, represented by a squadron or a platoon, and 
                guarding Napoleon in repose; and that was the splendid epoch when 
                the grand army had Marengo behind it and Austerlitz before it.--&quot;Sire,&quot; 
                said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon, &quot;yesterday 
                I saw the most intrepid man in your Empire.&quot;--&quot;What 
                man is that?&quot; said the Emperor brusquely, &quot;and what 
                has he done?&quot;--&quot;He wants to do something, Sire.&quot;--&quot;What 
                is it?&quot;--&quot;To visit the sewers of Paris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This man existed and his name was Bruneseau.</p>

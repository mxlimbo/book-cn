              <p> 　　MARIUS INDIGENT </p>
              <p> 　　Life became hard for Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch.</p>
              <p> 　　He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called 
                de la vache enrage; that is to say, he endured great hardships 
                and privations.</p>
              <p> 　　A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights 
                without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, 
                weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, 
                an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which 
                one finds locked on one at night because one's rent is not paid, 
                the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers 
                of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever 
                nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are often 
                the only things which one has to devour.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride, 
                because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he 
                was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the 
                age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped 
                his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew 
                the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable 
                and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, from which 
                the strong emerge sublime.</p>
              <p> 　　A crucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires 
                a scoundrel or a demi-god.</p>
              <p> 　　For many great deeds are performed in petty combats.</p>
              <p> 　　There are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate, which 
                defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities 
                and turpitudes. Noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, 
                which are requited with no renown, which are saluted with no trumpet 
                blast. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are 
                the fields of battle which have their heroes; obscure heroes, 
                who are, sometimes, grander than the heroes who win renown.</p>
              <p> 　　Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always 
                a step-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth 
                to might of soul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness 
                is a good milk for the magnanimous.</p>
              <p> 　　There came a moment in Marius' life, when he swept his own 
                landing, when he bought his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the 
                fruiterer's, when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip 
                into the baker's and purchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively 
                to his attic as though he had stolen it.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shop 
                on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed 
                him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who 
                had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from 
                a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow 
                to the butcher's astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid 
                six or seven sous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under 
                his arm, between two books, and went away. It was Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself, he lived for 
                three days.</p>
              <p> 　　On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the 
                fat, on the third he gnawed the bone.</p>
              <p> 　　Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, and sent him the 
                sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on every occasion, 
                saying that he needed nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution 
                which we have just described was effected within him.</p>
              <p> 　　From that time forth, he had not put off his black garments.</p>
              <p> 　　But his garments were quitting him.</p>
              <p> 　　The day came when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would 
                go next.</p>
              <p> 　　What was to be done?</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done some good turns, 
                gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned by 
                some porter or other, and it was a new coat.</p>
              <p> 　　But this coat was green.</p>
              <p> 　　Then Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall.</p>
              <p> 　　This made his coat black. As he wished always to appear in 
                mourning, he clothed himself with the night.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. 
                He was supposed to live in Courfeyrac's room, which was decent, 
                and where a certain number of law-books backed up and completed 
                by several dilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library 
                required by the regulations.</p>
              <p> 　　He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac's quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of 
                the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and 
                respect. M. Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read 
                it, tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. 
                Two or three days later, Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, 
                who was alone in his room, talking aloud to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He always did this whenever he was greatly agitated.</p>
              <p> 　　She listened, and the old man was saying: &quot;If you were 
                not a fool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer 
                at the same time.&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT</p>
              <p> 　　 This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:--</p>
              <p> 　　An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, 
                and Thenardier, although Thenardier was in close confinement. 
                Babet had arranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same 
                day, as the reader has seen from Montparnasse's account to Gavroche. 
                Montparnasse was to help them from outside.</p>
              <p> 　　Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, 
                had had time, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, 
                to mature a plan.</p>
              <p> 　　In former times, those severe places where the discipline 
                of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed 
                of four stone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp 
                bed, a grated window, and a door lined with iron, and were called 
                dungeons; but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays 
                they are composed of an iron door, a grated window, a camp bed, 
                a flagged pavement, four stone walls, and a stone ceiling, and 
                are called chambers of punishment.</p>
              <p> 　　A little light penetrates towards mid-day. The inconvenient 
                point about these chambers which, as the reader sees, are not 
                dungeons, is that they allow the persons who should be at work 
                to think.</p>
              <p> 　　So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment 
                with a rope.</p>
              <p> 　　As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne 
                courtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing 
                he found in the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; 
                Guelemer, that is to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　Brujon, of whom it is high time that the reader should have 
                a complete idea, was, with an appearance of delicate health and 
                a profoundly premeditated languor, a polished, intelligent sprig, 
                and a thief, who had a caressing glance, and an atrocious smile. 
                His glance resulted from his will, and his smile from his nature. 
                His first studies in his art had been directed to roofs.</p>
              <p> 　　He had made great progress in the industry of the men who 
                tear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by 
                the process called double pickings.</p>
              <p> 　　The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment 
                peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers 
                were re-laying and re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion 
                of the slates on the prison.</p>
              <p> 　　The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated 
                from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there 
                were scaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs 
                in the direction of liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit 
                thing to be seen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in 
                the prison. The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent 
                that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the 
                dormitories with a sheathing of wood, because stones were in the 
                habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their 
                beds. In spite of this antiquity, the authorities committed the 
                error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners, 
                of placing there &quot;the hard cases,&quot; as they say in prison 
                parlance.</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, 
                and a top story which was called the Bel-Air (FineAir). A large 
                chimney-flue, probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes 
                de la Force, started from the groundfloor, traversed all four 
                stories, cut the dormitories, where it figured as a flattened 
                pillar, into two portions, and finally pierced the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory.</p>
              <p> 　　They had been placed, by way of precaution, on the lower story.</p>
              <p> 　　Chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against 
                the chimney.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story 
                known as Fine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, 
                after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochere 
                of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and 
                shrubs in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out 
                a little white rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green 
                shutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques.</p>
              <p> 　　Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda 
                an enormous black, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the outer wall of La Force.</p>
              <p> 　　This wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through 
                Berquin.</p>
              <p> 　　Lofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker 
                roof, which could be seen beyond.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the roof of the New Building. There one could descry 
                four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they were the windows 
                of the Fine-Air.</p>
              <p> 　　A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed 
                the dormitories.</p>
              <p> 　　The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort 
                of large hall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings 
                and double doors of sheet iron, which were studded with enormous 
                bolts. When one entered from the north end, one had on one's left 
                the four dormer-windows, on one's right, facing the windows, at 
                regular intervals, four square, tolerably vast cages, separated 
                by narrow passages, built of masonry to about the height of the 
                elbow, and the rest, up to the roof, of iron bars.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these 
                cages since the night of the 3d of February.</p>
              <p> 　　No one was ever able to discover how, and by what connivance, 
                he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a bottle of wine, invented, 
                so it is said, by Desrues, with which a narcotic is mixed, and 
                which the band of the Endormeurs, or Sleep-compellers, rendered 
                famous.</p>
              <p> 　　There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers, 
                half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an 
                unfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.</p>
              <p> 　　On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the 
                two lost children, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who 
                had escaped that morning, was waiting for them in the street as 
                well as Montparnasse, rose softly, and with the nail which Brujon 
                had found, began to pierce the chimney against which their beds 
                stood. The rubbish fell on Brujon's bed, so that they were not 
                heard. Showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges, 
                and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar. Those 
                of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fall asleep again, and 
                left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices.</p>
              <p> 　　Brujon was adroit; Guelemer was vigorous.</p>
              <p> 　　Before any sound had reached the watcher, who was sleeping 
                in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory, the wall had, 
                been pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron grating which barred 
                the upper orifice of the flue forced, and the two redoubtable 
                ruffians were on the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　The wind and rain redoubled, the roof was slippery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a good night to leg it!&quot; said Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them 
                from the surrounding wall.</p>
              <p> 　　At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the musket of 
                a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of 
                the rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of 
                the iron bars which they had just wrenched off, flung the other 
                over the outer wall, crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to 
                the coping of the wall, got astride of it, let themselves slip, 
                one after the other, along the rope, upon a little roof which 
                touches the bath-house, pulled their rope after them, jumped down 
                into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it, pushed open 
                the porter's wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled this, 
                opened the porte-cochere, and found themselves in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen 
                in bed in the dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, 
                who were prowling about the neighborhood.</p>
              <p> 　　They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a 
                bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　They had sustained no other damage, however, than that of 
                scratching nearly all the skin off their hands.</p>
              <p> 　　That night, Thenardier was warned, without any one being able 
                to explain how, and was not asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　Towards one o'clock in the morning, the night being very dark, 
                he saw two shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, 
                in front of the dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One 
                halted at the window, long enough to dart in a glance. This was 
                Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier recognized him, and understood.</p>
              <p> 　　This was enough.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure 
                of precaution under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, 
                with armed force, was kept in sight.</p>
              <p> 　　The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, marched up and 
                down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The Fine-Air was 
                lighted by a skylight.</p>
              <p> 　　The prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, a jailer, escorted 
                by two dogs,--this was still in vogue at that time,--entered his 
                cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing 
                two pounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, 
                in which swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons and tapped 
                the bars.</p>
              <p> 　　This man and his dogs made two visits during the night.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron 
                bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, 
                &quot;in order to preserve it from the rats,&quot; as he said.</p>
              <p> 　　As Thenardier was kept in sight, no objection had been made 
                to this spike.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, it was remembered afterwards, that one of the jailers 
                had said: &quot;It would be better to let him have only a wooden 
                spike.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At two o'clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old 
                soldier, was relieved, and replaced by a conscript.</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments later, the man with the dogs paid his visit, 
                and went off without noticing anything, except, possibly, the 
                excessive youth and &quot;the rustic air&quot; of the &quot;raw 
                recruit.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two hours afterwards, at four o'clock, when they came to relieve 
                the conscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a 
                log near Thenardier's cage. As for Thenardier, he was no longer 
                there.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, 
                another hole in the roof. One of the planks of his bed had been 
                wrenched off, and probably carried away with him, as it was not 
                found.</p>
              <p> 　　They also seized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained 
                the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had 
                been drugged. The soldier's bayonet had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed 
                that Thenardier was out of reach.</p>
              <p> 　　The truth is, that he was no longer in the New Building, but 
                that he was still in great danger.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had 
                found the remains of Brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the 
                upper trap of the chimney, but, as this broken fragment was much 
                too short, he had not been able to escape by the outer wall, as 
                Brujon and Guelemer had done.</p>
              <p> 　　When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, 
                one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood 
                on that spot, in the last century, a house of which only the back 
                wall now remains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the 
                height of the third story between the adjoining buildings. This 
                ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still 
                to be seen there; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, 
                is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop.</p>
              <p> 　　Through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and 
                lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of La 
                Force.</p>
              <p> 　　The empty space on the street left by the demolished house 
                is half-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five 
                stone posts. In this recess lies concealed a little shanty which 
                leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing.</p>
              <p> 　　The fence has a gate, which, a few years ago, was fastened 
                only by a latch.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the crest of this ruin that Thenardier had succeeded 
                in reaching, a little after one o'clock in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　How had he got there?</p>
              <p> 　　That is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand.</p>
              <p> 　　The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and helped 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters 
                to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from compartment 
                to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then 
                to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, 
                and thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that 
                itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the 
                roof of the Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his 
                belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round 
                the prison as far as the hut? But the outer wall of La Force formed 
                a crenellated and unequal line; it mounted and descended, it dropped 
                at the firemen's barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, it 
                was cut in twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height 
                on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavee; everywhere occurred 
                falls and right angles; and then, the sentinels must have espied 
                the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken by Thenardier 
                still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was 
                impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Thenardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty which 
                changes precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, 
                a legless man into an athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity 
                into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into 
                genius, had Thenardier invented a third mode? No one has ever 
                found out.</p>
              <p> 　　The marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for.</p>
              <p> 　　The man who makes his escape, we repeat, is inspired; there 
                is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious 
                gleam of flight; the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising 
                than the flight towards the sublime, and one says of the escaped 
                thief: &quot;How did he contrive to scale that wall?&quot; in 
                the same way that one says of Corneille:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where did he find the means of dying?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, 
                with his clothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows 
                bleeding, his knees torn, Thenardier had reached what children, 
                in their figurative language, call the edge of the wall of the 
                ruin, there he had stretched himself out at full length, and there 
                his strength had failed him.</p>
              <p> 　　A steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the 
                pavement of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　The rope which he had was too short.</p>
              <p> 　　There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair 
                which he had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling 
                <br>
                himself that the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the 
                idea of hearing the neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four 
                within a few minutes, an hour when the sentinel was relieved and 
                when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof, 
                staring in horror at a terrible depth, at the light of the street 
                lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavement longed for yet 
                frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had 
                succeeded, if they had heard him, and if they would come to his 
                assistance. He listened.</p>
              <p> 　　With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through 
                the street since he had been there.</p>
              <p> 　　Nearly the whole of the descent of the market-gardeners from 
                Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes, and from Bercy to the 
                markets was accomplished through the Rue Saint-Antoine.</p>
              <p> 　　Four o'clock struck.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments later, that terrified and confused uproar which 
                follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison.</p>
              <p> 　　The sound of doors opening and shutting, the creaking of gratings 
                on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the hoarse shouts 
                of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavement of 
                the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past 
                the grated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole 
                of the top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in 
                the barracks on the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which 
                the torch lighted up in the rain, went and came along the roofs.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, Thenardier perceived in the direction of 
                the Bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in 
                doleful wise.</p>
              <p> 　　He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under 
                the heavy rains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, 
                subject to the giddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror 
                of a certain arrest, and his thoughts, like the pendulum of a 
                clock, swung from one of these ideas to the other:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dead if I fall, caught if I stay.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of this anguish, he suddenly saw, the street 
                being still dark, a man who was gliding along the walls and coming 
                from the Rue Pavee, halt in the recess above which Thenardier 
                was, as it were, suspended.</p>
              <p> 　　Here this man was joined by a second, who walked with the 
                same caution, then by a third, then by a fourth.</p>
              <p> 　　When these men were re-united, one of them lifted the latch 
                of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the enclosure in 
                which the shanty stood.</p>
              <p> 　　They halted directly under Thenardier. These men had evidently 
                chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without 
                being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the 
                wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It must be added, that 
                the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent 
                an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch 
                who feels himself lost.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash 
                before his eyes,--these men conversed in slang.</p>
              <p> 　　The first said in a low but distinct voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let's cut.</p>
              <p> 　　What are we up to here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The second replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's raining hard enough to put out the very devil's 
                fire.</p>
              <p> 　　And the bobbies will be along instanter. There's a soldier 
                on guard yonder.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall get nabbed here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　These two words, icigo and icicaille, both of which mean ici, 
                and which belong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the 
                second to the slang of the Temple, were flashes of light for Thenardier. 
                By the icigo he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, 
                by the icicaille he knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had 
                been an old-clothes broker at the Temple.</p>
              <p> 　　The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken 
                except in the Temple, and Babet was really the only person who 
                spoke it in all its purity.</p>
              <p> 　　Had it not been for the icicaille, Thenardier would not have 
                recognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's no hurry yet, let's wait a bit.</p>
              <p> 　　How do we know that he doesn't stand in need of us?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　By this, which was nothing but French, Thenardier recognized 
                Montparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand 
                all slangs and to speak none of them.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders 
                betrayed him.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier did not hesitate.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Guelemer.</p>
              <p> 　　Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you jabbering about?</p>
              <p> 　　The tavern-keeper hasn't managed to cut his stick.</p>
              <p> 　　He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't! You have to 
                be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet 
                to make a rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make 
                false keys, file your irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, 
                and disguise yourself!</p>
              <p> 　　The old fellow hasn't managed to play it, he doesn't understand 
                how to work the business.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Babet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken 
                by Poulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly 
                colored and risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine 
                is to the language of Andre Chenier:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act.</p>
              <p> 　　You have to be knowing.</p>
              <p> 　　He's only a greenhorn.</p>
              <p> 　　He must have let himself be taken in by a bobby, perhaps even 
                by a sheep who played it on him as his pal.</p>
              <p> 　　Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? 
                You have seen all those lights.</p>
              <p> 　　He's recaptured, there!</p>
              <p> 　　He'll get off with twenty years.</p>
              <p> 　　I ain't afraid, I ain't a coward, but there ain't anything 
                more to do, or otherwise they'd lead us a dance.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't get mad, come with us, let's go drink a bottle of old 
                wine together.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One doesn't desert one's friends in a scrape,&quot; 
                grumbled Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I tell you he's nabbed!&quot; retorted Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At the present moment, the inn-keeper ain't worth a 
                ha'penny. We can't do nothing for him. Let's be off.</p>
              <p> 　　Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; 
                the fact is, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians 
                who never abandon each other, had prowled all night long about 
                La Force, great as was their peril, in the hope of seeing Thenardier 
                make his appearance on the top of some wall.</p>
              <p> 　　But the night, which was really growing too fine,--for the 
                downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted,--the 
                cold which was overpowering them, their soaked garments, their 
                hole-ridden shoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth 
                in the prison, the hours which had elapsed, the patrol which they 
                had encountered, the hope which was vanishing, all urged them 
                to beat a retreat.</p>
              <p> 　　Montparnasse himself, who was, perhaps, almost Thenardier's 
                son-in-law, yielded.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment more, and they would be gone.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers 
                of the Meduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which 
                had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon.</p>
              <p> 　　He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. 
                An idea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; 
                he drew from his pocket the end of Brujon's rope, which he had 
                detached from the chimney of the New Building, and flung it into 
                the space enclosed by the fence.</p>
              <p> 　　This rope fell at their feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A widow,&quot;[37] said Babet.</p>
              <p> 　　 [37] Argot of the Temple.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;My tortouse!&quot;[38] said Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　 [38] Argot of the barriers.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;The tavern-keeper is there,&quot; said Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　They raised their eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier thrust out his head a very little.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quick!&quot; said Montparnasse, &quot;have you the other 
                end of the rope, Brujon?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Knot the two pieces together, we'll fling him the rope, 
                he can fasten it to the wall, and he'll have enough of it to get 
                down with.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier ran the risk, and spoke:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am paralyzed with cold.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll warm you up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't budge.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let yourself slide, we'll catch you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My hands are benumbed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only fasten the rope to the wall.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then one of us must climb up,&quot; said Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Three stories!&quot; ejaculated Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　An ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that 
                had been used in the shanty in former times, ran along the wall 
                and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see Thenardier. 
                This flue, then much damaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, 
                but the marks of it are still visible.</p>
              <p> 　　It was very narrow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One might get up by the help of that,&quot; said Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By that flue?&quot; exclaimed Babet, &quot;a grown-up 
                cove, never! it would take a brat.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A brat must be got,&quot; resumed Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are we to find a young 'un?&quot; said Guelemer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait,&quot; said Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've got the very article.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that 
                no one was passing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut 
                the gate behind him, and set off at a run in the direction of 
                the Bastille.</p>
              <p> 　　Seven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to 
                Thenardier; Babet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; 
                at last the gate opened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, 
                breathless, and followed by Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms 
                of these ruffians with a tranquil air.</p>
              <p> 　　The water was dripping from his hair. Guelemer addressed him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you a man, young 'un?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A young 'un like me's a man, and men like you are babes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The brat's tongue's well hung!&quot; exclaimed Babet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Paris brat ain't made of straw,&quot; added Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　Montparnasse answered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Climb up that flue.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With this rope,&quot; said Babet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And fasten it,&quot; continued Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the top of the wall,&quot; went on Babet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the cross-bar of the window,&quot; added Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And then?&quot; said Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There!&quot; said Guelemer.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, 
                and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips 
                which signifies:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's a man up there whom you are to save,&quot; resumed 
                Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you?&quot; began Brujon again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Greenhorn!&quot; replied the lad, as though the question 
                appeared a most unprecedented one to him.</p>
              <p> 　　And he took off his shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of 
                the shanty, whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's 
                weight, and handed him the rope which Brujon had knotted together 
                during Montparnasse's absence.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was 
                easy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when he was on the point of ascending, Thenardier, 
                who saw life and safety approaching, bent over the edge of the 
                wall; the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping 
                with sweat, upon his livid cheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, 
                his bristling gray beard, and Gavroche recognized him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hullo! it's my father!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, that won't hinder.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the 
                ascent.</p>
              <p> 　　He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as 
                though it had been a horse.</p>
              <p> 　　and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of the 
                window.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later, Thenardier was in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself 
                out of danger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; 
                the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, 
                all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood 
                erect and free, ready to march onward.</p>
              <p> 　　These were this man's first words:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, whom are we to eat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent 
                remark, which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder. 
                To eat, true sense:</p>
              <p> 　　to devour.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let's get well into a corner,&quot; said Brujon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let's settle it in three words, and part at once.</p>
              <p> 　　There was an affair that promised well in the Rue Plumet, 
                a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate on a 
                garden, and lone women.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well! why not?&quot; demanded Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your girl, Eponine, went to see about the matter,&quot; 
                replied Babet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,&quot; added Guelemer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing to be made there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The girl's no fool,&quot; said Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still, it must be seen to.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Brujon, &quot;it must be looked 
                up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, 
                who, during this colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; 
                he waited a few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would 
                turn towards him, then he put on his shoes again, and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that all?</p>
              <p> 　　You don't want any more, my men?</p>
              <p> 　　Now you're out of your scrape.</p>
              <p> 　　I'm off.</p>
              <p> 　　I must go and get my brats out of bed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And off he went.</p>
              <p> 　　The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.</p>
              <p> 　　When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des 
                Ballets, Babet took Thenardier aside.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Did you take a good look at that young 'un?&quot; he 
                asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What young 'un?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not particularly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I don't know, but it strikes me that it was your 
                son.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!&quot; said Thenardier, &quot;do you think so?&quot;<br>

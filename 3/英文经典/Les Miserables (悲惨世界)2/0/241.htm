              <p> 　　THE BATTLE BEGUN</p>
              <p> 　　 Cosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready 
                to take fire. Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, 
                slowly drew together these two beings, all charged and all languishing 
                with the stormy electricity of passion, these two souls which 
                were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning, and 
                which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds 
                in a flash of fire.</p>
              <p> 　　The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it 
                has finally fallen into disrepute.</p>
              <p> 　　One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two beings fell in 
                love because they looked at each other. That is the way people 
                do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way.</p>
              <p> 　　The rest is nothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing 
                is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to 
                each other by the exchange of that spark.</p>
              <p> 　　At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted 
                that glance which troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that 
                he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He caused her the same good and the same evil.</p>
              <p> 　　She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and 
                she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking 
                elsewhere. Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had 
                already begun to think Marius handsome.</p>
              <p> 　　But as he paid no attention to her, the young man was nothing 
                to her.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he 
                had beautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming 
                tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, 
                that he held himself badly when he walked, if you like, but with 
                a grace that was all his own, that he did not appear to be at 
                all stupid, that his whole person was noble, gentle, simple, proud, 
                and that, in short, though he seemed to be poor, yet his air was 
                fine.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other 
                those first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, 
                Cosette did not immediately understand.</p>
              <p> 　　She returned thoughtfully to the house in the Rue de l'Ouest, 
                where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had come to spend 
                six weeks.</p>
              <p> 　　The next morning, on waking, she thought of that strange young 
                man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to pay attention 
                to her, and it did not appear to her that this attention was the 
                least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary, 
                somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual.</p>
              <p> 　　A substratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and 
                the idea caused her a wholly childish joy, that she was going 
                to take her revenge at last.</p>
              <p> 　　Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, 
                though in an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. 
                Women play with their beauty as children do with a knife. They 
                wound themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader will recall Marius' hesitations, his palpitations, 
                his terrors.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed 
                Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, she said to Jean Valjean: &quot;Father, let us stroll 
                about a little in that direction.&quot; Seeing that Marius did 
                not come to her, she went to him.</p>
              <p> 　　In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, strange to say, the first symptom of true love in 
                a young man is timidity; in a young girl it is boldness.</p>
              <p> 　　This is surprising, and yet nothing is more simple. It is 
                the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming, each 
                the other's qualities.</p>
              <p> 　　That day, Cosette's glance drove Marius beside himself, and 
                Marius' glance set Cosette to trembling.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius went away confident, and Cosette uneasy.</p>
              <p> 　　From that day forth, they adored each other.</p>
              <p> 　　The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound 
                melancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since 
                the day before. She no longer recognized it.</p>
              <p> 　　The whiteness of soul in young girls, which is composed of 
                coldness and gayety, resembles snow.</p>
              <p> 　　It melts in love, which is its sun.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette did not know what love was.</p>
              <p> 　　She had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense.</p>
              <p> 　　On the books of profane music which entered the convent, amour 
                (love) was replaced by tambour (drum) or pandour.</p>
              <p> 　　This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the 
                big girls, such as:</p>
              <p> 　　Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, Pity is not a pandour.</p>
              <p> 　　But Cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied 
                herself much with the &quot;drum.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Therefore, she did not know what name to give to what she 
                now felt.</p>
              <p> 　　Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name 
                of one's malady?</p>
              <p> 　　She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. 
                She did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful 
                or dangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she 
                loved.</p>
              <p> 　　She would have been greatly astonished, had any one said to 
                her:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You do not sleep?</p>
              <p> 　　But that is forbidden! You do not eat?</p>
              <p> 　　Why, that is very bad!</p>
              <p> 　　You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart?</p>
              <p> 　　That must not be!</p>
              <p> 　　You blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black 
                appears at the end of a certain green walk?</p>
              <p> 　　But that is abominable!&quot; She would not have understood, 
                and she would have replied: &quot;What fault is there of mine 
                in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly 
                suited to the state of her soul.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mute contemplation, 
                the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition of youth 
                to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a 
                dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, 
                but having as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, 
                nor defect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, 
                a chimaera with a form. Any nearer and more palpable meeting would 
                have alarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was still half 
                immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister.</p>
              <p> 　　She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns 
                combined.</p>
              <p> 　　The spirit of the convent, with which she had been permeated 
                for the space of five years, was still in the process of slow 
                evaporation from her person, and made everything tremble around 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　In this situation he was not a lover, he was not even an admirer, 
                he was a vision. She set herself to adoring Marius as something 
                charming, luminous, and impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled 
                at him with all frankness.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with 
                impatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably 
                happy, and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her 
                whole thought when she said to Jean Valjean:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another.</p>
              <p> 　　They did not address each other, they did not salute each 
                other, they did not know each other; they saw each other; and 
                like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues, 
                they lived by gazing at each other.</p>
              <p> 　　It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed, 
                beautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and 
                in ignorance of her love.</p>
              <p> 　　She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.</p>

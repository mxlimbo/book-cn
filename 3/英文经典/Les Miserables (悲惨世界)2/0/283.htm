              <p> 　　NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE</p>
              <p> 　　The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to 
                the street widened out, the other extremity narrowed together 
                into a pocket without exit.</p>
              <p> 　　Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easily 
                barricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible except 
                from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full 
                sight.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.</p>
              <p> 　　Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of 
                the mob. There was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight.</p>
              <p> 　　In the space of a flash of lightning, in the rear, to right 
                and left, shops, stables, area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, 
                shutters of every description were closed, from the ground floor 
                to the roof.</p>
              <p> 　　A terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window 
                on two clothes-poles for drying linen, in order to deaden the 
                effect of musketry.</p>
              <p> 　　The wine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good 
                reason, that the mob had rushed into it.--&quot;Ah my God!</p>
              <p> 　　Ah my God!&quot; sighed Mame Hucheloup.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella.</p>
              <p> 　　You will gatch gold.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron 
                bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, 
                ten fathoms of street had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had 
                seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer 
                named Anceau; this dray contained three barrels of lime, which 
                they placed beneath the piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised 
                the cellar trap, and all the widow Hucheloup's empty casks were 
                used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled 
                in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up the barrels 
                and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone.</p>
              <p> 　　Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no 
                one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from 
                the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks.</p>
              <p> 　　When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street 
                was already barred with a rampart higher than a man.</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing like the hand of the populace for building 
                everything that is built by demolishing.</p>
              <p> 　　Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers.</p>
              <p> 　　Gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish.</p>
              <p> 　　Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She served the barricade 
                as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.</p>
              <p> 　　An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped 
                the driver, made the passengers alight, offered his hand to &quot;the 
                ladies,&quot; <br>
                dismissed the conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and 
                the horses by the bridle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Omnibuses,&quot; said he, &quot;do not pass the Corinthe.</p>
              <p> 　　Non licet omnibus adire Corinthum.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off 
                at their will, through the Rue Mondetour, and the omnibus lying 
                on its side completed the bar across the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first 
                story.</p>
              <p> 　　Her eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and 
                she cried in a low tone.</p>
              <p> 　　Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The end of the world has come,&quot; she muttered.</p>
              <p> 　　Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup's fat, red, wrinkled 
                neck, and said to Grantaire:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman's neck 
                as an infinitely delicate thing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. 
                Matelote had mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized 
                her round her waist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter 
                at the window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Matelote is homely!&quot; he cried:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Matelote is of a dream of ugliness! Matelote is a chimaera.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic Pygmalion, who was 
                making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with one of them, 
                the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to give 
                it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens!</p>
              <p> 　　She has chromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian's mistress, 
                and she is a good girl.</p>
              <p> 　　I guarantee that she will fight well.</p>
              <p> 　　Every good girl contains a hero.</p>
              <p> 　　As for Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior.</p>
              <p> 　　Look at her moustaches! She inherited them from her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　A hussar indeed!</p>
              <p> 　　She will fight too.</p>
              <p> 　　These two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue.</p>
              <p> 　　Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as there 
                are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic 
                acid; however, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me.</p>
              <p> 　　Gentlemen, my father always detested me because I could not 
                understand mathematics.</p>
              <p> 　　I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good 
                fellow.</p>
              <p> 　　Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of 
                it, and the result is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had 
                been rich, there would have been no more poor people!</p>
              <p> 　　You would have seen!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, if the kind hearts only had fat purses, how much better 
                things would go!</p>
              <p> 　　I picture myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild's fortune!</p>
              <p> 　　How much good he would do!</p>
              <p> 　　Matelote, embrace me!</p>
              <p> 　　You are voluptuous and timid! You have cheeks which invite 
                the kiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kiss of a lover.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hold your tongue, you cask!&quot; said Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire retorted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am the capitoul[52] and the master of the floral games!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　[52] Municipal officer of Toulouse.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, 
                gun in hand, raised his beautiful, austere face.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, as the reader knows, had something of the Spartan 
                and of the Puritan in his composition. He would have perished 
                at Thermopylae with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda with Cromwell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grantaire,&quot; he shouted, &quot;go get rid of the 
                fumes of your wine somewhere else than here.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't disgrace the barricade!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that he had had a glass of cold water 
                flung in his face. He seemed to be rendered suddenly sober.</p>
              <p> 　　He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked 
                at Enjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me sleep here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go and sleep somewhere else,&quot; cried Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　But Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes 
                fixed on him, replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me sleep here,--until I die.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, 
                of willing, of living, and of dying.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire replied in a grave tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head 
                fell heavily on the table, and, as is the usual effect of the 
                second period of inebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and 
                abruptly thrust him, an instant later he had fallen asleep.</p>

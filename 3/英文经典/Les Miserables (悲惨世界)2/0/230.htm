              <p> ¡¡¡¡FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. 
                The fermentation entered the boiling state.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Ever since 1830, petty partial revolts had been going on here 
                and there, which were quickly suppressed, but ever bursting forth 
                afresh, the sign of a vast underlying conflagration.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Something terrible was in preparation.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct 
                and imperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. France kept 
                an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was 
                beginning its ebullition.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union 
                of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, 
                grave and stormy.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The government was there purely and simply called in question. 
                There people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of 
                keeping quiet.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear 
                that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, 
                and &quot;that they would fight without counting the number of 
                the enemy.&quot; This engagement once entered into, a man seated 
                in the corner of the wine-shop &quot;assumed a sonorous tone,&quot; 
                and said, &quot;You understand! You have sworn!&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Sometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first 
                floor, and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself 
                as well as to the fathers of families.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡That was the formula.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In the tap-rooms, &quot;subversive&quot; pamphlets were read.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They treated the government with contempt, says a secret report 
                of that time.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Words like the following could be heard there:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I don't know the names of the leaders.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡We folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡One workman said: &quot;There are three hundred of us, let 
                each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and fifty 
                francs with which to procure powder and shot.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Another said:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two. 
                In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. 
                With twenty-five thousand men we can face them.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Another said: &quot;I don't sleep at night, because I make 
                cartridges all night.&quot; From time to time, men &quot;of bourgeois 
                appearance, and in good coats&quot; came and &quot;caused embarrassment,&quot; 
                and with the air of &quot;command,&quot; shook hands with the 
                most important, and then went away.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They never stayed more than ten minutes.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;It was murmured by all who were there,&quot; to borrow 
                the very expression of one of those who were present.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, 
                efore the whole wine-shop: &quot;We have no arms!&quot; One of 
                his comrades replied:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The soldiers have!&quot; thus parodying without being 
                aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation to the army in Italy:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,&quot; 
                adds one report, &quot;they did not communicate it to each other.&quot; 
                It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what 
                they said.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡These reunions were sometimes periodical.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡At certain ones of them, there were never more than eight 
                or ten persons present, and they were always the same.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was so 
                full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through 
                enthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way to 
                their work.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some 
                of these wine-shops who embraced new-comers.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Other expressive facts came to light.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark: 
                &quot;Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing 
                the Rue de Charonne.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The balloting was carried on in their caps.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons 
                in the Rue de Cotte.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords, 
                canes, clubs, and foils.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡One day, the buttons were removed from the foils.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A workman said:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;There are twenty-five of us, but they don't count on 
                me, because I am looked upon as a machine.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Later on, that machine became Quenisset.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired 
                a strange and indescribable notoriety.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to another woman:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;For a long time, there has been a strong force busy 
                making cartridges.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In the open street, proclamation could be seen addressed to 
                the National Guard in the departments. One of these proclamations 
                was signed:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Burtot, wine-merchant.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an 
                Italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller 
                in the Marche Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which 
                seemed to emanate from an occult power.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Groups formed around him, and applauded.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected 
                and noted down.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, 
                our bill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.&quot;--&quot;The 
                breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted 
                to us many mediums.&quot;--&quot;The future of nations is being 
                worked out in our obscure ranks.&quot;--&quot; Here are the fixed 
                terms:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡action or reaction, revolution or counter-revolution. For, 
                at our epoch, we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡For the people against the people, that is the question.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡There is no other.&quot;--&quot;On the day when we cease to 
                suit you, break us, but up to that day, help us to march on.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡All this in broad daylight.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the 
                eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡On the 4th of April, 1832, a passer-by mounted the post on 
                the corner which forms the angle of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite 
                and shouted:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I am a Babouvist!&quot; But beneath Babeuf, the people 
                scented Gisquet.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Among other things, this man said:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Down with property!</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches revolution, 
                it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and royalist 
                so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts with 
                feathers.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring classes.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Silence, citizen spy!&quot; cried an artisan.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡This shout put an end to the discourse.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Mysterious incidents occurred.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a &quot;very 
                well dressed man,&quot; who said to him:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Whither are you bound, citizen?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Sir,&quot; replied the workingman, &quot;I have not 
                the honor of your acquaintance.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I know you very well, however.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡And the man added:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Don't be alarmed, I am an agent of the committee. You 
                are suspected of not being quite faithful.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed 
                on you.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;We shall meet again soon.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, 
                not only in the wine-shops, but in the street.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Get yourself received very soon,&quot; said a weaver 
                to a cabinet-maker.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;There is going to be a shot to fire.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, 
                fraught with evident Jacquerie:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Who governs us?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;M. Philippe.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;No, it is the bourgeoisie.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word 
                Jacquerie in a bad sense.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Jacques were the poor.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other 
                as they passed by:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;We have a good plan of attack.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Only the following was caught of a private conversation between 
                four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere 
                du Trone:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking 
                about Paris any more.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Who was the he?</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Menacing obscurity.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The principal leaders,&quot; as they said in the faubourg, 
                held themselves apart.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop 
                near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society 
                aid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving 
                as intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about 
                these leaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular 
                arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before 
                the Court of Peers:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Who was your leader?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I knew of none and I recognized none.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes 
                idle reports, rumors, hearsay.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Other indications cropped up.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around 
                the ground on which a house was in process of construction, in 
                the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter 
                on which were still legible the following lines:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in 
                the sections for the different societies.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ And, as a postscript:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, 
                No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house 
                of a gunsmith in that court.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The section owns no arms.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing 
                to his neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he 
                picked up another paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, 
                of which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest 
                attaching to these strange documents:--</p>
              <p>¡¡¡¡| Q| C | D | E | Learn this list by heart. After so doing | 
                | | | || you will tear it up. The men admitted | | | | | | will 
                do thesame when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders 
                to them. | | | | | | Health and Fraternity, | | | | | | u og a 
                fe L. |</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret 
                of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four 
                capital letters:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs [scouts], and 
                the sense of the letters:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡u og a fe, which was a date, and meant April 15th, 1832.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by 
                very characteristic notes.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Thus:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Q. Bannerel. 8 guns, 83 cartridges.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A safe man.--C. Boubiere.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡1 pistol, 40 cartridges.--D. Rollet.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.-- E. Tessier.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡1 sword, 1 cartridge-box. Exact.--Terreur.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡8 guns. Brave, etc.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, 
                a third paper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, 
                this sort of enigmatical list:--Unite:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Barra.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Soize.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Salle-au-Comte. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher? </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡J. J. R. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Caius Gracchus. </p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Right of revision.</p>

              <p> ¡¡¡¡ The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew 
                its significance.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of 
                the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the 
                Rights of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. 
                To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more 
                than history, we may publish them.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It should be added, that the foundation of the Society of 
                the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date when 
                this paper was found.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Perhaps this was only a rough draft.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according 
                to written notes, material facts begin to make their appearance.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, 
                there were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike 
                lengthwise and in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares 
                of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and 
                a card, on which was written the following:-- </p>
              <p>¡¡¡¡ Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . . 12 ounces.<br>
                ¡¡¡ Sulphur . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces.<br>
                ¡¡¡ Charcoal . . . . . . . . . . . 2<br>
                ¡¡¡ ounces and a half. <br>
                ¡¡¡ Water . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled 
                a strong smell of powder.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A mason returning from his day's work, left behind him a little 
                package on a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡This package was taken to the police station.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It was opened, and in it were found two printed dialogues, 
                signed Lahautiere, a song entitled: &quot;Workmen, band together,&quot; 
                and a tin box full of cartridges.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him 
                to see how warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his 
                waistcoat.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise and the 
                Barriere du Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while 
                playing, discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits 
                of wood, a bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the 
                preparation of cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were 
                grains of hunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot whose interior 
                presented evident traces of melted lead.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly 
                at five o'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain 
                Pardon, who was afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section 
                and got himself killed in the insurrection of April, 1834, found 
                him standing near his bed, and holding in his hand some cartridges 
                which he was in the act of preparing.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen 
                to meet between the Barriere Picpus and the Barriere Charenton 
                in a little lane between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front 
                of which there was a &quot;Jeu de Siam.&quot;[33] One drew a pistol 
                from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the perspiration 
                of his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the pistol and 
                added more powder to what was already in the pan.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Then the two men parted.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ [33] A game of ninepins, in which one side of the ball is 
                smaller than the other, so that it does not roll straight, but 
                describes a curve on the ground.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg 
                in the affair of April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred 
                cartridges and twenty-four flints.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The government one day received a warning that arms and two 
                hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. 
                On the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. 
                The remarkable point about it was, that the police were not able 
                to seize a single one.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡An intercepted letter read:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The day is not far distant when, within four hours by 
                the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. 
                The approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in 
                the face of the government.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis, 
                which was already perceptible.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The bourgeois talked peaceably to the working-classes of what 
                was in preparation. They said:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;How is the rising coming along?&quot; in the same tone 
                in which they would have said:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;How is your wife?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Well, when are you going to make the attack?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Another shop-keeper said:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The attack will be made soon.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;I know it.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there 
                are twenty-five thousand.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a small pistol 
                which he was willing to sell for seven francs.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Not a point in Paris nor in France was exempt from it.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The artery was beating everywhere. Like those membranes which 
                arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body, the 
                network of secret societies began to spread all over the country.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡From the associations of the Friends of the People, which 
                was at the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of 
                the Rights of Man, which also dated from one of the orders of 
                the day:</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Pluviose, Year 40 of the republican era, which was destined 
                to survive even the mandate of the Court of Assizes which pronounced 
                its dissolution, and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections 
                significant names like the following:--</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡ Pikes. Tocsin. Signal cannon. Phrygian cap. January 21. The 
                beggars. The vagabonds. Forward march. Robespierre. Level. Ca 
                Ira.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of 
                Action. These were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened 
                ahead. Other associations sought to recruit themselves from the 
                great mother societies.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The members of sections complained that they were torn asunder.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization 
                of the Municipalities.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Thus the associations for the liberty of the press, for individual 
                liberty, for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided into 
                three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Then the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized 
                on a military footing, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by 
                a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; 
                there were never more than five men who knew each other. Creation 
                where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped 
                with the genius of Venice.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, 
                the Society of Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred 
                about among these the republican affiliations.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It was denounced and repudiated there.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal 
                cities, Lyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society 
                of the Rights of Man, the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. All 
                had a revolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. We 
                have already mentioned this word.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing 
                with the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less 
                moved than the faubourgs.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the 
                Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying 
                points for the students.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Society of the Friends of the A B C affiliated to the 
                Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met, as we 
                have seen, in the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembled 
                also, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of 
                the Rue Mondetour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were 
                secret.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Others were as public as possible, and the reader can judge 
                of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone 
                in one of the ulterior prosecutions: &quot;Where was this meeting 
                held?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;In the Rue de la Paix.&quot; &quot;At whose house?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;In the street.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;What sections were there?&quot; &quot;Only one.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Which?&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;The Manuel section.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡&quot;Who was its leader?&quot; &quot;I.&quot; &quot;You are 
                too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking 
                the government.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Where did your instructions come from?&quot; &quot;From the 
                central committee.&quot;</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The army was mined at the same time as the population, as 
                was proved subsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, 
                and Epinard. They counted on the fifty-second regiment, on the 
                fifth, on the eighth, on the thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth 
                light cavalry. In Burgundy and in the southern towns they planted 
                the liberty tree; that is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Such was the situation.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the 
                population, as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation 
                and made it felt.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡That was the sore point.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡This old faubourg, peopled like an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, 
                and angry as a hive of bees, was quivering with expectation and 
                with the desire for a tumult. Everything was in a state of agitation 
                there, without any interruption, however, of the regular work.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre 
                physiognomy.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic 
                roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡It is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence 
                that it is dangerous to have extremes meet.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; 
                for it received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, 
                strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. 
                In times of revolution misery is both cause and effect.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The blow which it deals rebounds upon it.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡This population full of proud virtue, capable to the highest 
                degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to 
                explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting 
                the fall of a spark.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the 
                wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg 
                Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at 
                the very gates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more 
                than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, 
                possess historical notoriety.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words 
                than on wine.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates 
                there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those 
                taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and 
                communicating with the profound and sacred breath; taverns where 
                the tables were almost tripods, and where was drunk what Ennius 
                calls the sibylline wine.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionary 
                agitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular 
                sovereignty.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like any 
                other; but, even when led astray, it remains great.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡We may say of it as of the blind cyclops, Ingens.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡In '93, according as the idea which was floating about was 
                good or evil, according as it was the day of fanaticism or of 
                enthusiasm, there leaped forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine 
                now savage legions, now heroic bands.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Savage.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Let us explain this word.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡When these bristling men, who in the early days of the revolutionary 
                chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with uplifted bludgeon, pike on 
                high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what 
                did they want?</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They wanted an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end 
                to the sword, work for men, instruction for the child, social 
                sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread 
                for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Progress; and that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, 
                they claimed in terrible wise, driven to extremities as they were, 
                half naked, club in fist, a roar in their mouths.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only 
                with fear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. 
                They seemed barbarians, and they were saviours.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡They demanded light with the mask of night.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, 
                but ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, 
                smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, 
                in white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with 
                their elbows on a velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, 
                insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past, of 
                the Middle Ages, of divine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, 
                of slavery, of the death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones 
                and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and the scaffold.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡For our part, if we were forced to make a choice between the 
                barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, 
                we should choose the barbarians.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible.</p>
              <p> ¡¡¡¡No perpendicular fall is necessary, in front any more than

              <p> 　　JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD</p>
              <p> 　　 However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and 
                he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion:--</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the 
                big sleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with 
                the gilded fillets, the justice's drawing-room furnished with 
                tapestries and vast arm-chairs; she had the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three 
                colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul 
                at Mother Gaucher's, put into Cosette's chamber, and, in order 
                to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he had 
                amalgamated with this bric-a-brac all the gay and graceful little 
                pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, an etagere, a bookcase 
                filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book, paper, 
                a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, 
                a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long damask curtains with 
                a red foundation and three colors, like those on the bed, hung 
                at the windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, the curtains 
                were of tapestry.</p>
              <p> 　　All winter long, Cosette's little house was heated from top 
                to bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter's lodge which was 
                situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a mattress on 
                a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an earthenware 
                water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in 
                one corner, and never any fire.</p>
              <p> 　　He dined with Cosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on 
                the table for his own use.</p>
              <p> 　　When Toussaint came, he had said to her:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the young lady who is the mistress of this house.&quot;--&quot;And 
                you, monsieur?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Toussaint replied in amazement.--&quot;I am a much better 
                thing than the master, I am the father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she 
                regulated their expenditure, which was very modest.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day, Jean Valjean put his arm through Cosette's and 
                took her for a walk. He led her to the Luxembourg, to the least 
                frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her to mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, 
                because that was a long way off.</p>
              <p> 　　As it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, 
                and the poor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn 
                down upon him Thenardier's epistle: &quot;To the benevolent gentleman 
                of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.&quot; He was fond 
                of taking Cosette to visit the poor and the sick. No stranger 
                ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet.</p>
              <p> 　　Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went 
                himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard.</p>
              <p> 　　Their wood and wine were put into a half-subterranean hollow 
                lined with rock-work which lay near the Rue de Babylone and which 
                had formerly served the chief-justice as a grotto; for at the 
                epoch of follies and &quot;Little Houses&quot; no love was without 
                a grotto.</p>
              <p> 　　In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box 
                destined for the reception of letters and papers; only, as the 
                three inhabitants of the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither 
                papers nor letters, the entire usefulness of that box, formerly 
                the go-between of a love affair, and the confidant of a love-lorn 
                lawyer, was now limited to the tax-collector's notices, and the 
                summons of the guard. For M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, 
                belonged to the national guard; he had not been able to escape 
                through the fine meshes of the census of 1831.</p>
              <p> 　　The municipal information collected at that time had even 
                reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable 
                and holy cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, 
                and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the 
                townhall.</p>
              <p> 　　Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform 
                and mounted guard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct 
                disguise which mixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. 
                Jean Valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday, the age 
                of legal exemption; but he did not appear to be over fifty; moreover, 
                he had no desire to escape his sergeant-major nor to quibble with 
                Comte de Lobau; he possessed no civil status, he was concealing 
                his name, he was concealing his identity, so he concealed his 
                age, he concealed everything; and, as we have just said, he willingly 
                did his duty as a national guard; the sum of his ambition lay 
                in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. This man had for 
                his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out 
                with Cosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had 
                the air of a retired officer.</p>
              <p> 　　When he went out alone, which was generally at night, he was 
                always dressed in a workingman's trousers and blouse, and wore 
                a cap which concealed his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Was this precaution or humility? Both.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, 
                and hardly noticed her father's peculiarities.</p>
              <p> 　　As for Toussaint, she venerated Jean Valjean, and thought 
                everything he did right.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, 
                said to her:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a queer fish.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's a saint.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered 
                or emerged except by the door on the Rue de Babylone.</p>
              <p> 　　Unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult 
                to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet.</p>
              <p> 　　That gate was always closed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated, in order not 
                to attract attention.</p>
              <p> 　　In this, possibly, he made a mistake.</p>

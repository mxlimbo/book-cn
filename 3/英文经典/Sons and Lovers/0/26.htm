            <p>　　They went back to the house, hand in hand, in silence. The chickens 
              came scampering down the path to her. He locked the door, and they 
              had the little house to themselves.</p>
            <p>　　He never forgot seeing her as she lay on the bed, when he wasunfastening 
              his collar. First he saw only her beauty, and was blindwith it. 
              She had the most beautiful body he had ever imagined. He stood unable 
              to move or speak, looking at her, his face half-smilingwith wonder. 
              And then he wanted her, but as he went forward to her,her hands 
              lifted in a little pleading movement, and he lookedat her face, 
              and stopped. Her big brown eyes were watching him,still and resigned 
              and loving; she lay as if she had given herself upto sacrifice: 
              there was her body for him; but the look at the backof her eyes, 
              like a creature awaiting immolation, arrested him,and all his blood 
              fell back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are sure you want me?&quot; he asked, as if a cold 
              shadowhad come over him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, quite sure.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was very quiet, very calm. She only realised that shewas 
              doing something for him. He could hardly bear it. She layto be sacrificed 
              for him because she loved him so much. And he hadto sacrifice her. 
              For a second, he wished he were sexless or dead. Then he shut his 
              eyes again to her, and his blood beat back again.</p>
            <p>　　And afterwards he loved her--loved her to the last fibreof his 
              being. He loved her. But he wanted, somehow, to cry. There was something 
              he could not bear for her sake. He stayedwith her till quite late 
              at night. As he rode home he felt thathe was finally initiated. 
              He was a youth no longer. But whyhad he the dull pain in his soul? 
              Why did the thought of death,the after-life, seem so sweet and consoling?</p>
            <p>　　He spent the week with Miriam, and wore her out with his passionbefore 
              it was gone. He had always, almost wilfully, to put her outof count, 
              and act from the brute strength of his own feelings. And he could 
              not do it often, and there remained afterwards alwaysthe sense of 
              failure and of death. If he were really with her,he had to put aside 
              himself and his desire. If he would have her,he had to put her aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When I come to you,&quot; he asked her, his eyes dark with 
              painand shame, &quot;you don't really want me, do you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; she replied quickly.</p>
            <p>　　He looked at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She began to tremble.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; she said, taking his face and shutting it 
              outagainst her shoulder--&quot;you see--as we are--how can I get 
              used to you? It would come all right if we were married.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He lifted her head, and looked at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean, now, it is always too much shock?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--and---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are always clenched against me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was trembling with agitation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm not used to the thought---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are lately,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But all my life. Mother said to me: 'There is one thingin 
              marriage that is always dreadful, but you have to bear it.' And 
              I believed it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And still believe it,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; she cried hastily. &quot;I believe, as you do, 
              that loving,even in THAT way, is the high-water mark of living.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That doesn't alter the fact that you never want it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she said, taking his head in her arms and rocking 
              in despair. &quot;Don't say so! You don't understand.&quot; She 
              rocked with pain. &quot;Don't I want your children?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But not me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How can you say so? But we must be married to have children---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we be married, then? I want you to have my children.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He kissed her hand reverently. She pondered sadly, watching him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We are too young,&quot; she said at length.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Twenty-four and twenty-three---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not yet,&quot; she pleaded, as she rocked herself in distress.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When you will,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She bowed her head gravely. The tone of hopelessness inwhich 
              he said these things grieved her deeply. It had always beena failure 
              between them. Tacitly, she acquiesced in what he felt.</p>
            <p>　　And after a week of love he said to his mother suddenly oneSunday 
              night, just as they were going to bed:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shan't go so much to Miriam's, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was surprised, but she would not ask him anything.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You please yourself,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　So he went to bed. But there was a new quietness abouthim which 
              she had wondered at. She almost guessed. She wouldleave him alone, 
              however. Precipitation might spoil things. She watched him in his 
              loneliness, wondering where he would end. He was sick, and much 
              too quiet for him. There was a perpetual littleknitting of his brows, 
              such as she had seen when he was a small baby,and which had been 
              gone for many years. Now it was the same again. And she could do 
              nothing for him. He had to go on alone, make hisown way.</p>
            <p>　　He continued faithful to Miriam. For one day he had loved herutterly. 
              But it never came again. The sense of failure grew stronger. At 
              first it was only a sadness. Then he began to feel he could notgo 
              on. He wanted to run, to go abroad, anything. Gradually he ceasedto 
              ask her to have him. Instead of drawing them together, it putthem 
              apart. And then he realised, consciously, that it was no good. It 
              was useless trying: it would never be a success between them.</p>
            <p>　　For some months he had seen very little of Clara. They hadoccasionally 
              walked out for half an hour at dinner-time. But he alwaysreserved 
              himself for Miriam. With Clara, however, his brow cleared,and he 
              was gay again. She treated him indulgently, as if he werea child. 
              He thought he did not mind. But deep below the surfaceit piqued 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes Miriam said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What about Clara? I hear nothing of her lately.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I walked with her about twenty minutes yesterday,&quot; 
              he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what did she talk about?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. I suppose I did all the jawing--I usually 
              do. I think I was telling her about the strike, and how the womentook 
              it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So he gave the account of himself.</p>
            <p>　　But insidiously, without his knowing it, the warmth he feltfor 
              Clara drew him away from Miriam, for whom he felt responsible,and 
              to whom he felt he belonged. He thought he was being quitefaithful 
              to her. It was not easy to estimate exactly the strengthand warmth 
              of one's feelings for a woman till they have run awaywith one.</p>
            <p>　　He began to give more time to his men friends. There was Jessop,at 
              the art school; Swain, who was chemistry demonstratorat the university; 
              Newton, who was a teacher; besides Edgar andMiriam's younger brothers. 
              Pleading work, he sketched and studiedwith Jessop. He called in 
              the university for Swain, and the two went&quot;down town&quot; 
              together. Having come home in the train with Newton,he called and 
              had a game of billiards with him in the Moonand Stars. If he gave 
              to Miriam the excuse of his men friends,he felt quite justified. 
              His mother began to be relieved. He always told her where he had 
              been.</p>
            <p>　　During the summer Clara wore sometimes a dress of soft cottonstuff 
              with loose sleeves. When she lifted her hands, her sleevesfell back, 
              and her beautiful strong arms shone out.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Half a minute,&quot; he cried. &quot;Hold your arm still.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He made sketches of her hand and arm, and the drawingscontained 
              some of the fascination the real thing had for him. Miriam, who 
              always went scrupulously through his books and papers,saw the drawings.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think Clara has such beautiful arms,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes! When did you draw them?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;On Tuesday, in the work-room. You know, I've got a cornerwhere 
              I can work. Often I can do every single thing they needin the department, 
              before dinner. Then I work for myselfin the afternoon, and just 
              see to things at night.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, turning the leaves of his sketch-book.</p>
            <p>　　Frequently he hated Miriam. He hated her as she bent forwardand 
              pored over his things. He hated her way of patiently castinghim 
              up, as if he were an endless psychological account. When hewas with 
              her, he hated her for having got him, and yet not got him,and he 
              tortured her. She took all and gave nothing, he said. At least,she 
              gave no living warmth. She was never alive, and giving off life. 
              Looking for her was like looking for something which did not exist. 
              She was only his conscience, not his mate. He hated her violently,and 
              was more cruel to her. They dragged on till the next summer. He 
              saw more and more of Clara.</p>
            <p>　　At last he spoke. He had been sitting working at homeone evening. 
              There was between him and his mother a peculiar conditionof people 
              frankly finding fault with each other. Mrs. Morel wasstrong on her 
              feet again. He was not going to stick to Miriam. Very well; then 
              she would stand aloof till he said something. It had been coming 
              a long time, this bursting of the storm in him, when he would come 
              back to her. This evening there was between them a peculiar condition 
              of suspense. He worked feverishly and mechanically,so that he could 
              escape from himself. It grew late. Through theopen door, stealthily, 
              came the scent of madonna lilies, almost asif it were prowling abroad. 
              Suddenly he got up and went out of doors.</p>
            <p>　　The beauty of the night made him want to shout. A half-moon,dusky 
              gold, was sinking behind the black sycamore at the end ofthe garden, 
              making the sky dull purple with its glow. Nearer, a dimwhite fence 
              of lilies went across the garden, and the air all roundseemed to 
              stir with scent, as if it were alive. He went acrossthe bed of pinks, 
              whose keen perfume came sharply across the rocking,heavy scent of 
              the lilies, and stood alongside the white barrierof flowers. They 
              flagged all loose, as if they were panting. The scent made him drunk. 
              He went down to the field to watchthe moon sink under.</p>
            <p>　　A corncrake in the hay-close called insistently. The moonslid 
              quite quickly downwards, growing more flushed. Behind himthe great 
              flowers leaned as if they were calling. And then,like a shock, he 
              caught another perfume, something raw and coarse. Hunting round, 
              he found the purple iris, touched their fleshy throatsand their 
              dark, grasping hands. At any rate, he had found something. They 
              stood stiff in the darkness. Their scent was brutal. The moon was 
              melting down upon the crest of the hill. It was gone;all was dark. 
              The corncrake called still.</p>
            <p>　　Breaking off a pink, he suddenly went indoors.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come, my boy,&quot; said his mother. &quot;I'm sure it's 
              time you wentto bed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He stood with the pink against his lips.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall break off with Miriam, mother,&quot; he answered 
              calmly.</p>
            <p>　　She looked up at him over her spectacles. He was staring backat 
              her, unswerving. She met his eyes for a moment, then took offher 
              glasses. He was white. The male was up in him, dominant. She did 
              not want to see him too clearly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I thought---&quot; she began.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he answered, &quot;I don't love her. I don't 
              want to marryher--so I shall have done.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; exclaimed his mother, amazed, &quot;I thought 
              lately youhad made up your mind to have her, and so I said nothing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I had--I wanted to--but now I don't want. It's no good. 
              I shall break off on Sunday. I ought to, oughtn't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know best. You know I said so long ago.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't help that now. I shall break off on Sunday.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said his mother, &quot;I think it will be best. 
              But latelyI decided you had made up your mind to have her, so I 
              said nothing,and should have said nothing. But I say as I have always 
              said,I DON'T think she is suited to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;On Sunday I break off,&quot; he said, smelling the pink. 
              He put the flower in his mouth. Unthinking, he bared his teeth,closed 
              them on the blossom slowly, and had a mouthful of petals. These 
              he spat into the fire, kissed his mother, and went to bed.</p>
            <p>　　On Sunday he went up to the farm in the early afternoon. He had 
              written Miriam that they would walk over the fields to Hucknall. 
              His mother was very tender with him. He said nothing. But shesaw 
              the effort it was costing. The peculiar set look on his facestilled 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never mind, my son,&quot; she said. &quot;You will be so 
              much betterwhen it is all over. &quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul glanced swiftly at his mother in surprise and resentment. 
              He did not want sympathy.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam met him at the lane-end. She was wearing a new dressof 
              figured muslin that had short sleeves. Those short sleeves,and Miriam's 
              brown-skinned arms beneath them--such pitiful, resignedarms--gave 
              him so much pain that they helped to make him cruel. She had made 
              herself look so beautiful and fresh for him. She seemedto blossom 
              for him alone. Every time he looked at her--a mature youngwoman 
              now, and beautiful in her new dress--it hurt so much that hisheart 
              seemed almost to be bursting with the restraint he put on it. But 
              he had decided, and it was irrevocable.</p>
            <p>　　On the hills they sat down, and he lay with his head in her lap,whilst 
              she fingered his hair. She knew that &quot;he was not there,&quot;as 
              she put it. Often, when she had him with her, she looked for him,and 
              could not find him. But this afternoon she was not prepared.</p>
            <p>　　It was nearly five o'clock when he told her. They were sittingon 
              the bank of a stream, where the lip of turf hung over a hollowbank 
              of yellow earth, and he was hacking away with a stick, as hedid 
              when he was perturbed and cruel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have been thinking,&quot; he said, &quot;we ought to 
              break off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; she cried in surprise.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because it's no good going on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why is it no good?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It isn't. I don't want to marry. I don't want ever to marry. 
              And if we're not going to marry, it's no good going on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why do you say this now?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I've made up my mind.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about these last months, and the things you toldme 
              then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't help it! I don't want to go on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't want any more of me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I want us to break off--you be free of me, I free of you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about these last months?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. I've not told you anything but what I thoughtwas 
              true.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why are you different now?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not--I'm the same--only I know it's no good going on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You haven't told me why it's no good.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I don't want to go on--and I don't want to marry.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How many times have you offered to marry me, and I wouldn't?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know; but I want us to break off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence for a moment or two, while he dug viciously 
              atthe earth. She bent her head, pondering. He was an unreasonable 
              child. He was like an infant which, when it has drunk its fill, 
              throws awayand smashes the cup. She looked at him, feeling she could 
              get holdof him and WRING some consistency out of him. But she was 
              helpless. Then she cried:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have said you were only fourteen--you are only FOUR!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He still dug at the earth viciously. He heard.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are a child of four,&quot; she repeated in her anger.</p>
            <p>　　He did not answer, but said in his heart: &quot;All right;if 
              I'm a child of four, what do you want me for? I don't wantanother 
              mother.&quot; But he said nothing to her, and there was silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And have you told your people?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have told my mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was another long interval of silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then what do you WANT?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, I want us to separate. We have lived on each other 
              allthese years; now let us stop. I will go my own way without you,and 
              you will go your way without me. You will have an independentlife 
              of your own then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was in it some truth that, in spite of her bitterness,she 
              could not help registering. She knew she felt in a sort ofbondage 
              to him, which she hated because she could not control it. She hated 
              her love for him from the moment it grew too strongfor her. And, 
              deep down, she had hated him because she lovedhim and he dominated 
              her. She had resisted his domination. She had fought to keep herself 
              free of him in the last issue. And she was free of him, even more 
              than he of her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And,&quot; he continued, &quot;we shall always be more 
              or lesseach other's work. You have done a lot for me, I for you. 
              Now let us start and live by ourselves.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What do you want to do?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing--only to be free,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　She, however, knew in her heart that Clara's influence wasover 
              him to liberate him. But she said nothing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what have I to tell my mother?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I told my mother,&quot; he answered, &quot;that I was breaking 
              off--cleanand altogether.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall not tell them at home,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Frowning, &quot;You please yourself,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He knew he had landed her in a nasty hole, and was leavingher 
              in the lurch. It angered him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tell them you wouldn't and won't marry me, and have broken 
              off,&quot;he said. &quot;It's true enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She bit her finger moodily. She thought over their whole affair. 
              She had known it would come to this; she had seen it all along. 
              It chimed with her bitter expectation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Always--it has always been so!&quot; she cried. &quot;It 
              has beenone long battle between us--you fighting away from me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It came from her unawares, like a flash of lightning. The man's 
              heart stood still. Was this how she saw it?</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But we've had SOME perfect hours, SOME perfect times,when 
              we were together!&quot; he pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never!&quot; she cried; &quot;never! It has always been 
              you fightingme off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not always--not at first!&quot; he pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Always, from the very beginning--always the same!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had finished, but she had done enough. He sat aghast. He 
              had wanted to say: &quot;It has been good, but it is at an end.&quot; 
              And she--she whose love he had believed in when he had despisedhimself--denied 
              that their love had ever been love. &quot;He hadalways fought away 
              from her?&quot; Then it had been monstrous. There had never been 
              anything really between them; all the timehe had been imagining 
              something where there was nothing. And shehad known. She had known 
              so much, and had told him so little. She had known all the time. 
              All the time this was at the bottomof her!</p>
            <p>　　He sat silent in bitterness. At last the whole affair appearedin 
              a cynical aspect to him. She had really played with him,not he with 
              her. She had hidden all her condemnation from him,had flattered 
              him, and despised him. She despised him now. He grew intellectual 
              and cruel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ought to marry a man who worships you,&quot; he said; 
              &quot;then youcould do as you liked with him. Plenty of men will 
              worship you,if you get on the private side of their natures. You 
              ought to marryone such. They would never fight you off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you!&quot; she said. &quot;But don't advise me to 
              marry someoneelse any more. You've done it before.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; he said; &quot;I will say no more.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He sat still, feeling as if he had had a blow, instead ofgiving 
              one. Their eight years of friendship and love, THE eightyears of 
              his life, were nullified.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When did you think of this?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought definitely on Thursday night.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I knew it was coming,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　That pleased him bitterly. &quot;Oh, very well! If she knew thenit 
              doesn't come as a surprise to her,&quot; he thought.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And have you said anything to Clara?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; but I shall tell her now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you remember the things you said this time last year,in 
              my grandmother's house--nay last month even?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;I do! And I meant them! I can't 
              helpthat it's failed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It has failed because you want something else.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It would have failed whether or not. YOU never believedin 
              me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed strangely.</p>
            <p>　　He sat in silence. He was full of a feeling that she haddeceived 
              him. She had despised him when he thought she worshipped him. She 
              had let him say wrong things, and had not contradicted him. She 
              had let him fight alone. But it stuck in his throat that she haddespised 
              him whilst he thought she worshipped him. She should havetold him 
              when she found fault with him. She had not played fair. He hated 
              her. All these years she had treated him as if he werea hero, and 
              thought of him secretly as an infant, a foolish child. Then why 
              had she left the foolish child to his folly? His heart washard against 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　She sat full of bitterness. She had known--oh, well shehad known! 
              All the time he was away from her she had summedhim up, seen his 
              littleness, his meanness, and his folly. Even she had guarded her 
              soul against him. She was not overthrown,not prostrated, not even 
              much hurt. She had known. Only why,as he sat there, had he still 
              this strange dominance over her? His very movements fascinated her 
              as if she were hypnotised by him. Yet he was despicable, false, 
              inconsistent, and mean. Why this bondagefor her? Why was it the 
              movement of his arm stirred her as nothingelse in the world could? 
              Why was she fastened to him? Why, even now,if he looked at her and 
              commanded her, would she have to obey? She would obey him in his 
              trifling commands. But once he was obeyed,then she had him in her 
              power, she knew, to lead him where she would. She was sure of herself. 
              Only, this new influence! Ah, he wasnot a man! He was a baby that 
              cries for the newest toy. And all the attachment of his soul would 
              not keep him. Very well,he would have to go. But he would come back 
              when he had tired of hisnew sensation.</p>
            <p>　　He hacked at the earth till she was fretted to death. She rose. 
              He sat flinging lumps of earth in the stream.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We will go and have tea here?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　They chattered over irrelevant subjects during tea. He held forth 
              on the love of ornament--the cottage parlour moved himthereto--and 
              its connection with aesthetics. She was cold and quiet. As they 
              walked home, she asked:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And we shall not see each other?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No--or rarely,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nor write?&quot; she asked, almost sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As you will,&quot; he answered. &quot;We're not strangers--nevershould 
              be, whatever happened. I will write to you now and again. You please 
              yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see!&quot; she answered cuttingly.</p>
            <p>　　But he was at that stage at which nothing else hurts. He had 
              made a great cleavage in his life. He had had a great shockwhen 
              she had told him their love had been always a conflict. Nothing 
              more mattered. If it never had been much, there was no needto make 
              a fuss that it was ended.</p>
            <p>　　He left her at the lane-end. As she went home, solitary,in her 
              new frock, having her people to face at the other end,he stood still 
              with shame and pain in the highroad, thinking ofthe suffering he 
              caused her.</p>
            <p>　　In the reaction towards restoring his self-esteem, he wentinto 
              the Willow Tree for a drink. There were four girls who hadbeen out 
              for the day, drinking a modest glass of port. They hadsome chocolates 
              on the table. Paul sat near with his whisky. He noticed the girls 
              whispering and nudging. Presently one,a bonny dark hussy, leaned 
              to him and said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have a chocolate?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The others laughed loudly at her impudence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right,&quot; said Paul. &quot;Give me a hard one--nut. 
              I don'tlike creams.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here you are, then,&quot; said the girl; &quot;here's an 
              almond for you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She held the sweet between her fingers. He opened his mouth. 
              She popped it in, and blushed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ARE nice!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; she answered, &quot;we thought you looked overcast,and 
              they dared me offer you a chocolate.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't mind if I have another--another sort,&quot; he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　And presently they were all laughing together.</p>
            <p>　　It was nine o'clock when he got home, falling dark. He enteredthe 
              house in silence. His mother, who had been waiting,rose anxiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I told her,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm glad,&quot; replied the mother, with great relief.</p>
            <p>　　He hung up his cap wearily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I said we'd have done altogether,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's right, my son,&quot; said the mother. &quot;It's 
              hard for her now,but best in the long run. I know. You weren't suited 
              for her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He laughed shakily as he sat down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've had such a lark with some girls in a pub,&quot; he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　His mother looked at him. He had forgotten Miriam now. He toldher 
              about the girls in the Willow Tree. Mrs. Morel looked at him. It 
              seemed unreal, his gaiety. At the back of it was too much horrorand 
              misery.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now have some supper,&quot; she said very gently.</p>
            <p>　　Afterwards he said wistfully:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She never thought she'd have me, mother, not from the first,and 
              so she's not disappointed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm afraid,&quot; said his mother, &quot;she doesn't give 
              up hopesof you yet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;perhaps not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll find it's better to have done,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said desperately.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, leave her alone,&quot; replied his mother. So he 
              left her,and she was alone. Very few people cared for her, and she 
              for veryfew people. She remained alone with herself, waiting.</p>

            <p>　　Mrs. Morel flushed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am sure I am not mean about her. She may be quiteas you 
              say, but---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't approve,&quot; he finished.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And do you expect me to?&quot; she answered coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes!--yes!--if you'd anything about you, you'd be glad! 
              Do you WANT to see her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I said I did.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I'll bring her--shall I bring her here?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You please yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I WILL bring her here--one Sunday--to tea. If you 
              thinka horrid thing about her, I shan't forgive you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mother laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As if it would make any difference!&quot; she said. He 
              knew hehad won.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, but it feels so fine, when she's there! She's sucha 
              queen in her way.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Occasionally he still walked a little way from chapel with Miriamand 
              Edgar. He did not go up to the farm. She, however, was very muchthe 
              same with him, and he did not feel embarrassed in her presence. 
              One evening she was alone when he accompanied her. They beganby 
              talking books: it was their unfailing topic. Mrs. Morel hadsaid 
              that his and Miriam's affair was like a fire fed on books--ifthere 
              were no more volumes it would die out. Miriam, for her part,boasted 
              that she could read him like a book, could place her fingerany minute 
              on the chapter and the line. He, easily taken in,believed that Miriam 
              knew more about him than anyone else. So itpleased him to talk to 
              her about himself, like the simplest egoist. Very soon the conversation 
              drifted to his own doings. It flatteredhim immensely that he was 
              of such supreme interest.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what have you been doing lately?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I--oh, not much! I made a sketch of Bestwood from the garden,that 
              is nearly right at last. It's the hundredth try.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So they went on. Then she said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've not been out, then, lately?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I went up Clifton Grove on Monday afternoon with Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was not very nice weather,&quot; said Miriam, &quot;was 
              it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I wanted to go out, and it was all right. The TrentIS 
              full.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And did you go to Barton?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; we had tea in Clifton.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;DID you! That would be nice.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was! The jolliest old woman! She gave us severalpompom 
              dahlias, as pretty as you like.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam bowed her head and brooded. He was quite unconsciousof 
              concealing anything from her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What made her give them you?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because she liked us--because we were jolly, I should think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam put her finger in her mouth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Were you late home?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　At last he resented her tone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I caught the seven-thirty.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They walked on in silence, and he was angry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how IS Clara?&quot; asked Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Quite all right, I think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's good!&quot; she said, with a tinge of irony. &quot;By 
              the way,what of her husband? One never hears anything of him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's got some other woman, and is also quite all right,&quot;he 
              replied. &quot;At least, so I think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see--you don't know for certain. Don't you think a positionlike 
              that is hard on a woman?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Rottenly hard!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's so unjust!&quot; said Miriam. &quot;The man does as 
              he likes---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then let the woman also,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How can she? And if she does, look at her position!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What of it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, it's impossible! You don't understand what a woman 
              forfeits---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I don't. But if a woman's got nothing but her fair 
              fameto feed on, why, it's thin tack, and a donkey would die of it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So she understood his moral attitude, at least, and she knewhe 
              would act accordingly.</p>
            <p>　　She never asked him anything direct, but she got to know enough.</p>
            <p>　　Another day, when he saw Miriam, the conversation turnedto marriage, 
              then to Clara's marriage with Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;she never knew the fearful 
              importanceof marriage. She thought it was all in the day's march--it 
              wouldhave to come--and Dawes--well, a good many women would have 
              giventheir souls to get him; so why not him? Then she developed 
              intothe femme incomprise, and treated him badly, I'll bet my boots.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And she left him because he didn't understand her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose so. I suppose she had to. It isn't altogethera 
              question of understanding; it's a question of living. With him,she 
              was only half-alive; the rest was dormant, deadened. And thedormant 
              woman was the femme incomprise, and she HAD to be awakened.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. I rather think he loves her as much as he 
              can,but he's a fool.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was something like your mother and father,&quot; said 
              Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; but my mother, I believe, got real joy and satisfactionout 
              of my father at first. I believe she had a passion for him;that's 
              why she stayed with him. After all, they were bound toeach other.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's what one MUST HAVE, I think,&quot; he continued--&quot;the 
              real,real flame of feeling through another person--once, only once,if 
              it only lasts three months. See, my mother looks as if she'dHAD 
              everything that was necessary for her living and developing. There's 
              not a tiny bit of feeling of sterility about her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And with my father, at first, I'm sure she had the real 
              thing. She knows; she has been there. You can feet it about her, 
              and about him,and about hundreds of people you meet every day; and, 
              once it hashappened to you, you can go on with anything and ripen.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What happened, exactly?&quot; asked Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's so hard to say, but the something big and intense 
              thatchanges you when you really come together with somebody else. 
              It almost seems to fertilise your soul and make it that you can 
              goon and mature.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you think your mother had it with your father?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; and at the bottom she feels grateful to him for givingit 
              her, even now, though they are miles apart.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you think Clara never had it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm sure.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam pondered this. She saw what he was seeking--a sortof baptism 
              of fire in passion, it seemed to her. She realisedthat he would 
              never be satisfied till he had it. Perhaps it wasessential to him, 
              as to some men, to sow wild oats; and afterwards,when he was satisfied, 
              he would not rage with restlessness any more, but could settle down 
              and give her his life into her hands. Well, then, if he must go, 
              let him go and have his fill--something big and intense,he called 
              it. At any rate, when he had got it, he would not wantit--that he 
              said himself; he would want the other thing that shecould give him. 
              He would want to be owned, so that he could work. It seemed to her 
              a bitter thing that he must go, but she could lethim go into an 
              inn for a glass of whisky, so she could let him goto Clara, so long 
              as it was something that would satisfy a need in him,and leave him 
              free for herself to possess.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you told your mother about Clara?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　She knew this would be a test of the seriousness of hisfeeling 
              for the other woman: she knew he was going to Clara forsomething 
              vital, not as a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute,if he told 
              his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;and she is coming to tea on Sunday.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;To your house?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I want mater to see her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a silence. Things had gone quicker than she thought. 
              She felt a sudden bitterness that he could leave her so soonand 
              so entirely. And was Clara to be accepted by his people,who had 
              been so hostile to herself?</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I may call in as I go to chapel,&quot; she said. &quot;It 
              is a longtime since I saw Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, astonished, and unconsciously 
              angry.</p>
            <p>　　On the Sunday afternoon he went to Keston to meet Clara atthe 
              station. As he stood on the platform he was trying to examinein 
              himself if he had a premonition.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do I FEEL as if she'd come?&quot; he said to himself, and 
              he triedto find out. His heart felt queer and contracted. That seemedlike 
              foreboding. Then he HAD a foreboding she would not come! Then she 
              would not come, and instead of taking her over thefields home, as 
              he had imagined, he would have to go alone. The train was late; 
              the afternoon would be wasted, and the evening. He hated her for 
              not coming. Why had she promised, then, if shecould not keep her 
              promise? Perhaps she had missed her train--hehimself was always 
              missing trains--but that was no reason whyshe should miss this particular 
              one. He was angry with her;he was furious.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly he saw the train crawling, sneaking round the corner. 
              Here, then, was the train, but of course she had not come. The greenengine 
              hissed along the platform, the row of brown carriages drew up,several 
              doors opened. No; she had not come! No! Yes; ah, thereshe was! She 
              had a big black hat on! He was at her side in a moment.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought you weren't coming,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She was laughing rather breathlessly as she put out her handto 
              him; their eyes met. He took her quickly along the platform,talking 
              at a great rate to hide his feeling. She looked beautiful. In her 
              hat were large silk roses, coloured like tarnished gold. Her costume 
              of dark cloth fitted so beautifully over her breastand shoulders. 
              His pride went up as he walked with her. He felt the station people, 
              who knew him, eyed her with aweand admiration.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was sure you weren't coming,&quot; he laughed shakily.</p>
            <p>　　She laughed in answer, almost with a little cry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I wondered, when I was in the train, WHATEVER I shoulddo 
              if you weren't there!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He caught her hand impulsively, and they went alongthe narrow 
              twitchel. They took the road into Nuttall andover the Reckoning 
              House Farm. It was a blue, mild day. Everywhere the brown leaves 
              lay scattered; many scarlet hipsstood upon the hedge beside the 
              wood. He gathered a few for her to wear.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Though, really,&quot; he said, as he fitted them into the 
              breastof her coat, &quot;you ought to object to my getting them, 
              because ofthe birds. But they don't care much for rose-hips in this 
              part,where they can get plenty of stuff. You often find the berriesgoing 
              rotten in the springtime.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So he chattered, scarcely aware of what he said, only knowinghe 
              was putting berries in the bosom of her coat, while she stoodpatiently 
              for him. And she watched his quick hands, so full of life,and it 
              seemed to her she had never SEEN anything before. Till now,everything 
              had been indistinct.</p>
            <p>　　They came near to the colliery. It stood quite still and blackamong 
              the corn-fields, its immense heap of slag seen rising almostfrom 
              the oats.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What a pity there is a coal-pit here where it is so pretty!&quot;said 
              Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think so?&quot; he answered. &quot;You see, I am 
              so used to itI should miss it. No; and I like the pits here and 
              there. I like therows of trucks, and the headstocks, and the steam 
              in the daytime,and the lights at night. When I was a boy, I always 
              thoughta pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was 
              a pit,with its steam, and its lights, and the burning bank,--and 
              I thoughtthe Lord was always at the pit-top.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　As they drew near home she walked in silence, and seemedto hang 
              back. He pressed her fingers in his own. She flushed,but gave no 
              response.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you want to come home?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I want to come,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　It did not occur to him that her position in his home wouldbe 
              rather a peculiar and difficult one. To him it seemed just as ifone 
              of his men friends were going to be introduced to his mother,only 
              nicer.</p>
            <p>　　The Morels lived in a house in an ugly street that ran downa 
              steep hill. The street itself was hideous. The house was rathersuperior 
              to most. It was old, grimy, with a big bay window, and itwas semi-detached; 
              but it looked gloomy. Then Paul opened the doorto the garden, and 
              all was different. The sunny afternoon was there,like another land. 
              By the path grew tansy and little trees. In frontof the window was 
              a plot of sunny grass, with old lilacs round it. And away went the 
              garden, with heaps of dishevelled chrysanthemumsin the sunshine, 
              down to the sycamore-tree, and the field,and beyond one looked over 
              a few red-roofed cottages to the hillswith all the glow of the autumn 
              afternoon.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel sat in her rocking-chair, wearing her blacksilk blouse. 
              Her grey-brown hair was taken smooth back from her browand her high 
              temples; her face was rather pale. Clara, suffering,followed Paul 
              into the kitchen. Mrs. Morel rose. Clara thoughther a lady, even 
              rather stiff. The young woman was very nervous. She had almost a 
              wistful look, almost resigned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother--Clara,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel held out her hand and smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He has told me a good deal about you,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　The blood flamed in Clara's cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I hope you don't mind my coming,&quot; she faltered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was pleased when he said he would bring you,&quot; replied 
              Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　Paul, watching, felt his heart contract with pain. His motherlooked 
              so small, and sallow, and done-for beside the luxuriant Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's such a pretty day, mother!&quot; he said. &quot;And 
              we saw a jay.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mother looked at him; he had turned to her. She thoughtwhat 
              a man he seemed, in his dark, well-made clothes. He was paleand 
              detached-looking; it would be hard for any woman to keep him. Her 
              heart glowed; then she was sorry for Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Perhaps you'll leave your things in the parlour,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Morel nicely to the young woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on,&quot; said Paul, and he led the way into the littlefront 
              room, with its old piano, its mahogany furniture, its yellowingmarble 
              mantelpiece. A fire was burning; the place was litteredwith books 
              and drawing-boards. &quot;I leave my things lying about,&quot;he 
              said. &quot;It's so much easier.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She loved his artist's paraphernalia, and the books, and thephotos 
              of people. Soon he was telling her: this was William,this was William's 
              young lady in the evening dress, this was Annieand her husband, 
              this was Arthur and his wife and the baby. She felt as if she were 
              being taken into the family. He showedher photos, books, sketches, 
              and they talked a little while. Then they returned to the kitchen. 
              Mrs. Morel put aside her book. Clara wore a blouse of fine silk 
              chiffon, with narrow black-and-whitestripes; her hair was done simply, 
              coiled on top of her head. She looked rather stately and reserved.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You have gone to live down Sneinton Boulevard?&quot; said 
              Mrs. Morel. &quot;When I was a girl--girl, I say!--when I was a 
              young woman WE livedin Minerva Terrace.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, did you!&quot; said Clara. &quot;I have a friend in 
              number 6.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And the conversation had started. They talked Nottinghamand Nottingham 
              people; it interested them both. Clara was stillrather nervous; 
              Mrs. Morel was still somewhat on her dignity. She clipped her language 
              very clear and precise. But they were goingto get on well together, 
              Paul saw.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel measured herself against the younger woman,and found 
              herself easily stronger. Clara was deferential. She knew Paul's 
              surprising regard for his mother, and she haddreaded the meeting, 
              expecting someone rather hard and cold. She was surprised to find 
              this little interested woman chatting with such readiness; and then 
              she felt, as she felt with Paul, that she would notcare to stand 
              in Mrs. Morel's way. There was something so hardand certain in his 
              mother, as if she never had a misgiving in her life.</p>
            <p>　　Presently Morel came down, ruffled and yawning, from hisafternoon 
              sleep. He scratched his grizzled head, he ploddedin his stocking 
              feet, his waistcoat hung open over his shirt. He seemed incongruous.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This is Mrs. Dawes, father,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Then Morel pulled himself together. Clara saw Paul's mannerof 
              bowing and shaking hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; exclaimed Morel. &quot;I am very glad 
              to see you--I am,I assure you. But don't disturb yourself. No, no 
              make yourselfquite comfortable, and be very welcome.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara was astonished at this flood of hospitality fromthe old 
              collier. He was so courteous, so gallant! She thoughthim most delightful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And may you have come far?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only from Nottingham,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;From Nottingham! Then you have had a beautiful dayfor your 
              journey.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then he strayed into the scullery to wash his hands and face,and 
              from force of habit came on to the hearth with the towel todry himself.</p>
            <p>　　At tea Clara felt the refinement and sang-froid of the household. 
              Mrs. Morel was perfectly at her ease. The pouring out the tea andattending 
              to the people went on unconsciously, without interruptingher in 
              her talk. There was a lot of room at the oval table; the chinaof 
              dark blue willow-pattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth. There 
              was a little bowl of small, yellow chrysanthemums. Clara felt she 
              completed the circle, and it was a pleasure to her. But she was 
              rather afraid of the self-possession of the Morels,father and all. 
              She took their tone; there was a feeling of balance. It was a cool, 
              clear atmosphere, where everyone was himself,and in harmony. Clara 
              enjoyed it, but there was a fear deep at thebottom of her.</p>
            <p>　　Paul cleared the table whilst his mother and Clara talked. Clara 
              was conscious of his quick, vigorous body as it came and went,seeming 
              blown quickly by a wind at its work. It was almost likethe hither 
              and thither of a leaf that comes unexpected. Most of herselfwent 
              with him. By the way she leaned forward, as if listening,Mrs. Morel 
              could see she was possessed elsewhere as she talked,and again the 
              elder woman was sorry for her.</p>
            <p>　　Having finished, he strolled down the garden, leaving the twowomen 
              to talk. It was a hazy, sunny afternoon, mild and soft. Clara glanced 
              through the window after him as he loitered amongthe chrysanthemums. 
              She felt as if something almost tangible fastenedher to him; yet 
              he seemed so easy in his graceful, indolent movement,so detached 
              as he tied up the too-heavy flower branches to their stakes,that 
              she wanted to shriek in her helplessness.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel rose.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You will let me help you wash up,&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, there are so few, it will only take a minute,&quot; 
              said the other.</p>
            <p>　　Clara, however, dried the tea-things, and was glad to be onsuch 
              good terms with his mother; but it was torture not to be ableto 
              follow him down the garden. At last she allowed herself to go;she 
              felt as if a rope were taken off her ankle.</p>
            <p>　　The afternoon was golden over the hills of Derbyshire. He stoodacross 
              in the other garden, beside a bush of pale Michaelmas daisies,watching 
              the last bees crawl into the hive. Hearing her coming,he turned 
              to her with an easy motion, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's the end of the run with these chaps.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara stood near him. Over the low red wall in front wasthe country 
              and the far-off hills, all golden dim.</p>
            <p>　　At that moment Miriam was entering through the garden-door.She 
              saw Clara go up to him, saw him turn, and saw them come torest together. 
              Something in their perfect isolation together madeher know that 
              it was accomplished between them, that they were,as she put it, 
              married. She walked very slowly down the cinder-trackof the long 
              garden.</p>
            <p>　　Clara had pulled a button from a hollyhock spire, and was breakingit 
              to get the seeds. Above her bowed head the pink flowers stared,as 
              if defending her. The last bees were falling down to the hive.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Count your money,&quot; laughed Paul, as she broke the 
              flat seedsone by one from the roll of coin. She looked at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm well off,&quot; she said, smiling.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How much? Pf!&quot; He snapped his fingers. &quot;Can I 
              turn theminto gold?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　They looked into each other's eyes, laughing. At that momentthey 
              became aware of Miriam. There was a click, and everythinghad altered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello, Miriam!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You said you'd 
              come!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. Had you forgotten?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She shook hands with Clara, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It seems strange to see you here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the other; &quot;it seems strange to 
              be here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a hesitation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This is pretty, isn't it?&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I like it very much,&quot; replied Clara.</p>
            <p>　　Then Miriam realised that Clara was accepted as she had never 
              been.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you come down alone?&quot; asked Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I went to Agatha's to tea. We are going to chapel. 
              I only called in for a moment to see Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You should have come in here to tea,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam laughed shortly, and Clara turned impatiently aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you like the chrysanthemums?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; they are very fine,&quot; replied Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Which sort do you like best?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. The bronze, I think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't think you've seen all the sorts. Come and look. 
              Come and see which are YOUR favourites, Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He led the two women back to his own garden, where the towsledbushes 
              of flowers of all colours stood raggedly along the path downto the 
              field. The situation did not embarrass him, to his knowledge.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look, Miriam; these are the white ones that came from your 
              garden. They aren't so fine here, are they?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But they're hardier. You're so sheltered; things grow bigand 
              tender, and then die. These little yellow ones I like. Will you 
              have some?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　While they were out there the bells began to ring in the church,sounding 
              loud across the town and the field. Miriam looked at thetower, proud 
              among the clustering roofs, and remembered the sketcheshe had brought 
              her. It had been different then, but he had not lefther even yet. 
              She asked him for a book to read. He ran indoors.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What! is that Miriam?&quot; asked his mother coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; she said she'd call and see Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You told her, then?&quot; came the sarcastic answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; why shouldn't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's certainly no reason why you shouldn't,&quot; said 
              Mrs. Morel,and she returned to her book. He winced from his mother's 
              irony,frowned irritably, thinking: &quot;Why can't I do as I like?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've not seen Mrs. Morel before?&quot; Miriam was saying 
              to Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; but she's so nice!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miriam, dropping her head; &quot;in some 
              ways she'svery fine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should think so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Had Paul told you much about her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He had talked a good deal.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence until he returned with the book.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When will you want it back?&quot; Miriam asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When you like,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　Clara turned to go indoors, whilst he accompanied Miriamto the 
              gate.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When will you come up to Willey Farm?&quot; the latter 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I couldn't say,&quot; replied Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother asked me to say she'd be pleased to see you any 
              time,if you cared to come.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you; I should like to, but I can't say when.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well!&quot; exclaimed Miriam rather bitterly, 
              turning away.</p>
            <p>　　She went down the path with her mouth to the flowers he hadgiven 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're sure you won't come in?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, thanks.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We are going to chapel.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, I shall see you, then!&quot; Miriam was very bitter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They parted. He felt guilty towards her. She was bitter,and she 
              scorned him. He still belonged to herself, she believed; yet he 
              could have Clara, take her home, sit with her next his motherin 
              chapel, give her the same hymn-book he had given herselfyears before. 
              She heard him running quickly indoors.</p>
            <p>　　But he did not go straight in. Halting on the plot of grass,he 
              heard his mother's voice, then Clara's answer:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What I hate is the bloodhound quality in Miriam.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said his mother quickly, &quot;yes; DOESN'T 
              it make youhate her, now!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His heart went hot, and he was angry with them for talkingabout 
              the girl. What right had they to say that? Something inthe speech 
              itself stung him into a flame of hate against Miriam. Then his own 
              heart rebelled furiously at Clara's taking the libertyof speaking 
              so about Miriam. After all, the girl was the better womanof the 
              two, he thought, if it came to goodness. He went indoors. His mother 
              looked excited. She was beating with her handrhythmically on the 
              sofa-arm, as women do who are wearing out. He could never bear to 
              see the movement. There was a silence;then he began to talk.</p>
            <p>　　In chapel Miriam saw him find the place in the hymn-bookfor Clara, 
              in exactly the same way as he used for herself. And during the sermon 
              he could see the girl across the chapel,her hat throwing a dark 
              shadow over her face. What did she think,seeing Clara with him? 
              He did not stop to consider. He felt himselfcruel towards Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　After chapel he went over Pentrich with Clara. It was a darkautumn 
              night. They had said good-bye to Miriam, and his heart hadsmitten 
              him as he left the girl alone. &quot;But it serves her right,&quot;he 
              said inside himself, and it almost gave him pleasure to go offunder 
              her eyes with this other handsome woman.</p>
            <p>　　There was a scent of damp leaves in the darkness. Clara's handlay 
              warm and inert in his own as they walked. He was full of conflict. 
              The battle that raged inside him made him feel desperate.</p>
            <p>　　Up Pentrich Hill Clara leaned against him as he went. He slid 
              his arm round her waist. Feeling the strong motionof her body under 
              his arm as she walked, the tightness in hischest because of Miriam 
              relaxed, and the hot blood bathed him. He held her closer and closer.</p>
            <p>　　Then: &quot;You still keep on with Miriam,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only talk. There never WAS a great deal more than talkbetween 
              us,&quot; he said bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your mother doesn't care for her,&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, or I might have married her. But it's all up really!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly his voice went passionate with hate.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If I was with her now, we should be jawing about the 'ChristianMystery', 
              or some such tack. Thank God, I'm not!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They walked on in silence for some time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you can't really give her up,&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't give her up, because there's nothing to give,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There is for her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know why she and I shouldn't be friends as longas 
              we live,&quot; he said. &quot;But it'll only be friends.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara drew away from him, leaning away from contact with him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you drawing away for?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer, but drew farther from him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why do you want to walk alone?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　Still there was no answer. She walked resentfully, hanging her 
              head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I said I would be friends with Miriam!&quot; he 
              exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　She would not answer him anything.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I tell you it's only words that go between us,&quot; he 
              persisted,trying to take her again.</p>
            <p>　　She resisted. Suddenly he strode across in front of her,barring 
              her way.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Damn it!&quot; he said. &quot;What do you want now?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd better run after Miriam,&quot; mocked Clara.</p>
            <p>　　The blood flamed up in him. He stood showing his teeth. She drooped 
              sulkily. The lane was dark, quite lonely. He suddenlycaught her 
              in his arms, stretched forward, and put his mouth onher face in 
              a kiss of rage. She turned frantically to avoid him. He held her 
              fast. Hard and relentless his mouth came for her. Her breasts hurt 
              against the wall of his chest. Helpless, she wentloose in his arms, 
              and he kissed her, and kissed her.</p>
            <p>　　He heard people coming down the hill.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stand up! stand up!&quot; he said thickly, gripping her 
              arm tillit hurt. If he had let go, she would have sunk to the ground.</p>
            <p>　　She sighed and walked dizzily beside him. They went on in silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We will go over the fields,&quot; he said; and then she 
              woke up.</p>
            <p>　　But she let herself be helped over the stile, and shewalked in 
              silence with him over the first dark field. It wasthe way to Nottingham 
              and to the station, she knew. He seemedto be looking about. They 
              came out on a bare hilltop where stoodthe dark figure of the ruined 
              windmill. There he halted. They stood together high up in the darkness, 
              looking at the lightsscattered on the night before them, handfuls 
              of glittering points,villages lying high and low on the dark, here 
              and there.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Like treading among the stars,&quot; he said, with a quaky 
              laugh.</p>

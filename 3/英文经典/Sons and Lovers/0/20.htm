            <p align="center"><b>DEFEAT OF MIRIAM I</b></p>
            <p>　　PAUL was dissatisfied with himself and with everything. The deepest 
              of his love belonged to his mother. When he felt hehad hurt her, 
              or wounded his love for her, he could not bear it. Now it was spring, 
              and there was battle between him and Miriam. This year he had a 
              good deal against her. She was vaguely awareof it. The old feeling 
              that she was to be a sacrifice to this love,which she had had when 
              she prayed, was mingled in all her emotions. She did not at the 
              bottom believe she ever would have him. She didnot believe in herself 
              primarily: doubted whether she could everbe what he would demand 
              of her. Certainly she never saw herselfliving happily through a 
              lifetime with him. She saw tragedy, sorrow,and sacrifice ahead. 
              And in sacrifice shewas proud, in renunciation she was strong, for 
              she did not trustherself to support everyday life. She was prepared 
              for the bigthings and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the 
              sufficiencyof the small day-life she could not trust.</p>
            <p>　　The Easter holidays began happily. Paul was his own frank self. 
              Yet she felt it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she stoodat 
              her bedroom window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood,in 
              whose branches a twilight was tangled, below the bright skyof the 
              afternoon. Grey-green rosettes of honeysuckle leaveshung before 
              the window, some already, she fancied, showing bud. It was spring, 
              which she loved and dreaded.</p>
            <p>　　Hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense. It was a 
              bright grey day. Paul came into the yard with his bicycle,which 
              glittered as he walked. Usually he rang his bell and laughedtowards 
              the house. To-day he walked with shut lips and cold,cruel bearing, 
              that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it. She knew him well 
              by now, and could tell from that keen-looking,aloof young body of 
              his what was happening inside him. There wasa cold correctness in 
              the way he put his bicycle in its place,that made her heart sink.</p>
            <p>　　She came downstairs nervously. She was wearing a new net blousethat 
              she thought became her. It had a high collar with a tiny ruff,reminding 
              her of Mary, Queen of Scots, and making her, she thought,look wonderfully 
              a woman, and dignified. At twenty she wasfull-breasted and luxuriously 
              formed. Her face was still like a softrich mask, unchangeable. But 
              her eyes, once lifted, were wonderful. She was afraid of him. He 
              would notice her new blouse.</p>
            <p>　　He, being in a hard, ironical mood, was entertaining the familyto 
              a description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist Chapel,conducted 
              by one of the well-known preachers of the sect. He sat at the head 
              of the table, his mobile face, with the eyesthat could be so beautiful, 
              shining with tenderness or dancingwith laughter, now taking on one 
              expression and then another,in imitation of various people he was 
              mocking. His mockeryalways hurt her; it was too near the reality. 
              He was too cleverand cruel. She felt that when his eyes were like 
              this, hard withmocking hate, he would spare neither himself nor 
              anybody else. But Mrs. Leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter, 
              and Mr. Leivers,just awake from his Sunday nap, was rubbing his 
              head in amusement. The three brothers sat with ruffled, sleepy appearance 
              in theirshirt-sleeves, giving a guffaw from time to time. The wholefamily 
              loved a &quot;take-off&quot; more than anything.</p>
            <p>　　He took no notice of Miriam. Later, she saw him remarkher new 
              blouse, saw that the artist approved, but it won fromhim not a spark 
              of warmth. She was nervous, could hardly reachthe teacups from the 
              shelves.</p>
            <p>　　When the men went out to milk, she ventured to addresshim personally.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You were late,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Was I?&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　There was silence for a while.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Was it rough riding?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I didn't notice it.&quot; She continued quickly to lay 
              the table. When she had finished---</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tea won't be for a few minutes. Will you come and lookat 
              the daffodils?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He rose without answering. They went out into the back garden 
              underthe budding damson-trees. The hills and the sky were clean 
              and cold. Everything looked washed, rather hard. Miriam glanced 
              at Paul. He was pale and impassive. It seemed cruel to her that 
              his eyesand brows, which she loved, could look so hurting.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Has the wind made you tired?&quot; she asked. She detectedan 
              underneath feeling of weariness about him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I think not,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It must be rough on the road--the wood moans so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can see by the clouds it's a south-west wind; that 
              helpsme here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see, I don't cycle, so I don't understand,&quot; she 
              murmured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there need to cycle to know that!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She thought his sarcasms were unnecessary. They went forwardin 
              silence. Round the wild, tussocky lawn at the back of the housewas 
              a thorn hedge, under which daffodils were craning forward fromamong 
              their sheaves of grey-green blades. The cheeks of the flowerswere 
              greenish with cold. But still some had burst, and their goldruffled 
              and glowed. Miriam went on her knees before one cluster,took a wild-looking 
              daffodil between her hands, turned up itsface of gold to her, and 
              bowed down, caressing it with her mouthand cheeks and brow. He stood 
              aside, with his hands in his pockets,watching her. One after another 
              she turned up to him the facesof the yellow, bursten flowers appealingly, 
              fondling them lavishlyall the while.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't they magnificent?&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Magnificent! It's a bit thick--they're pretty!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise. 
              He watched her crouching, sipping the flowers with fervid kisses.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why must you always be fondling things?&quot; he said irritably.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I love to touch them,&quot; she replied, hurt.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can you never like things without clutching them as if 
              youwanted to pull the heart out of them? Why don't you have a bitmore 
              restraint, or reserve, or something?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked up at him full of pain, then continued slowlyto stroke 
              her lips against a ruffled flower. Their scent, as shesmelled it, 
              was so much kinder than he; it almost made her cry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You wheedle the soul out of things,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
              wouldnever wheedle--at any rate, I'd go straight.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He scarcely knew what he was saying. These things came fromhim 
              mechanically. She looked at him. His body seemed one weapon,firm 
              and hard against her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're always begging things to love you,&quot; he said, 
              &quot;as if youwere a beggar for love. Even the flowers, you have 
              to fawn on them---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Rhythmically, Miriam was swaying and stroking the flower withher 
              mouth, inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudderas it 
              came to her nostrils.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't want to love--your eternal and abnormal cravingis 
              to be loved. You aren't positive, you're negative. You absorb, absorb, 
              as if you must fill yourself up with love,because you've got a shortage 
              somewhere.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was stunned by his cruelty, and did not hear. He had notthe 
              faintest notion of what he was saying. It was as if his fretted,tortured 
              soul, run hot by thwarted passion, jetted off these sayingslike 
              sparks from electricity. She did not grasp anything he said. She 
              only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her. She 
              never realised in a flash. Over everything she broodedand brooded.</p>
            <p>　　After tea he stayed with Edgar and the brothers, taking nonotice 
              of Miriam. She, extremely unhappy on this looked-for holiday,waited 
              for him. And at last he yielded and came to her. She was determined 
              to track this mood of his to its origin. She counted it not much 
              more than a mood.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we go through the wood a little way?&quot; she asked 
              him,knowing he never refused a direct request.</p>
            <p>　　They went down to the warren. On the middle path theypassed a 
              trap, a narrow horseshoe hedge of small fir-boughs,baited with the 
              guts of a rabbit. Paul glanced at it frowning. She caught his eye.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it dreadful?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know! Is it worse than a weasel with its teeth 
              in arabbit's throat? One weasel or many rabbits? One or the other 
              must go!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was taking the bitterness of life badly. She was rathersorry 
              for him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We will go back to the house,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't 
              wantto walk out.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They went past the lilac-tree, whose bronze leaf-buds werecoming 
              unfastened. Just a fragment remained of the haystack,a monument 
              squared and brown, like a pillar of stone. There wasa little bed 
              of hay from the last cutting.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let us sit here a minute,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　He sat down against his will, resting his back against the hardwall 
              of hay. They faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowedwith 
              sunset, tiny white farms standing out, the meadows golden,the woods 
              dark and yet luminous, tree-tops folded over tree-tops,distinct 
              in the distance. The evening had cleared, and the eastwas tender 
              with a magenta flush under which the land lay stilland rich.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it beautiful?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　But he only scowled. He would rather have had it ugly just then.</p>
            <p>　　At that moment a big bull-terrier came rushing up, open-mouthed,pranced 
              his two paws on the youth's shoulders, licking his face. Paul drew 
              back, laughing. Bill was a great relief to him. He pushed the dog 
              aside, but it came leaping back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Get out,&quot; said the lad, &quot;or I'll dot thee one.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But the dog was not to be pushed away. So Paul had a littlebattle 
              with the creature, pitching poor Bill away from him, who,however, 
              only floundered tumultuously back again, wild with joy. The two 
              fought together, the man laughing grudgingly, the doggrinning all 
              over. Miriam watched them. There was something patheticabout the 
              man. He wanted so badly to love, to be tender. The rough way he 
              bowled the dog over was really loving. Bill got up,panting with 
              happiness, his brown eyes rolling in his white face,and lumbered 
              back again. He adored Paul. The lad frowned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Bill, I've had enough o' thee,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　But the dog only stood with two heavy paws, that quiveredwith 
              love, upon his thigh, and flickered a red tongue at him. He drew 
              back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said--&quot;no--I've had enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And in a minute the dog trotted off happily, to vary the fun.</p>
            <p>　　He remained staring miserably across at the hills, whose stillbeauty 
              he begrudged. He wanted to go and cycle with Edgar. Yet he had not 
              the courage to leave Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why are you sad?&quot; she asked humbly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not sad; why should I be,&quot; he answered. &quot;I'm 
              only normal.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She wondered why he always claimed to be normal when hewas disagreeable.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But what is the matter?&quot; she pleaded, coaxing him 
              soothingly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay!&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　He picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd far better not talk,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I wish to know---&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed resentfully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You always do,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not fair to me,&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　He thrust, thrust, thrust at the ground with the pointed stick,digging 
              up little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation. 
              She gently and firmly laid her band on his wrist.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't!&quot; she said. &quot;Put it away.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He flung the stick into the currant-bushes, and leaned back. 
              Now he was bottled up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she pleaded softly.</p>
            <p>　　He lay perfectly still, only his eyes alive, and they fullof 
              torment.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know,&quot; he said at length, rather wearily--&quot;you 
              know--we'dbetter break off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was what she dreaded. Swiftly everything seemed to darkenbefore 
              her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why!&quot; she murmured. &quot;What has happened?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing has happened. We only realise where we are. It's 
              no good---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She waited in silence, sadly, patiently. It was no good beingimpatient 
              with him. At any rate, he would tell her now what ailed him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We agreed on friendship,&quot; he went on in a dull, monotonous 
              voice. &quot;How often HAVE we agreed for friendship! And yet--it 
              neitherstops there, nor gets anywhere else.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was silent again. She brooded. What did he mean? He was so 
              wearying. There was something he would not yield. Yet she must be 
              patient with him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can only give friendship--it's all I'm capable of--it'sa 
              flaw in my make-up. The thing overbalances to one side--I hatea 
              toppling balance. Let us have done.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was warmth of fury in his last phrases. He meant sheloved 
              him more than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she 
              had not in herself that which he wanted. It was thedeepest motive 
              of her soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep shedared neither 
              realise nor acknowledge. Perhaps she was deficient. Like an infinitely 
              subtle shame, it kept her always back. If it were so,she would do 
              without him. She would never let herself want him. She would merely 
              see.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But what has happened?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing--it's all in myself--it only comes out just now. 
              We're always like this towards Easter-time.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He grovelled so helplessly, she pitied him. At least shenever 
              floundered in such a pitiable way. After all, it was hewho was chiefly 
              humiliated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why--I mustn't come often--that's all. Why should I monopoliseyou 
              when I'm not--- You see, I'm deficient in something with regardto 
              you---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was telling her he did not love her, and so ought to leave 
              hera chance with another man. How foolish and blind and shamefully 
              clumsyhe was! What were other men to her! What were men to her at 
              all! But he, ah! she loved his soul. Was HE deficient in something? 
              Perhaps he was.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I don't understand,&quot; she said huskily. &quot;Yesterday---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The night was turning jangled and hateful to him as thetwilight 
              faded. And she bowed under her suffering.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know,&quot; he cried, &quot;you never will! You'll never 
              believe thatI can't--can't physically, any more than I can fly up 
              like a skylark---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot; she murmured. Now she dreaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Love you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He hated her bitterly at that moment because he made her suffer. 
              Love her! She knew he loved her. He really belonged to her. This 
              about not loving her, physically, bodily, was a mere perversityon 
              his part, because he knew she loved him. He was stupid likea child. 
              He belonged to her. His soul wanted her. She guessedsomebody had 
              been influencing him. She felt upon him the hardness,the foreignness 
              of another influence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What have they been saying at home?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not that,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　And then she knew it was. She despised them for their commonness,his 
              people. They did not know what things were really worth.</p>
            <p>　　He and she talked very little more that night. After all heleft 
              her to cycle with Edgar.</p>
            <p>　　He had come back to his mother. Hers was the strongesttie in 
              his life. When he thought round, Miriam shrank away. There was a 
              vague, unreal feel about her. And nobody else mattered. There was 
              one place in the world that stood solid and did not meltinto unreality: 
              the place where his mother was. Everybody elsecould grow shadowy, 
              almost non-existent to him, but she could not. It was as if the 
              pivot and pole of his life, from which he couldnot escape, was his 
              mother.</p>
            <p>　　And in the same way she waited for him. In him was establishedher 
              life now. After all, the life beyond offered very little toMrs. 
              Morel. She saw that our chance for DOING is here, and doingcounted 
              with her. Paul was going to prove that she had been right;he was 
              going to make a man whom nothing should shift off his feet;he was 
              going to alter the face of the earth in some way which mattered. 
              Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him. Whatever he did 
              shefelt her soul stood by him, ready, as it were, to hand him his 
              tools. She could not bear it when he was with Miriam. William was 
              dead. She would fight to keep Paul.</p>
            <p>　　And he came back to her. And in his soul was a feeling of thesatisfaction 
              of self-sacrifice because he was faithful to her. She loved him 
              first; he loved her first. And yet it was not enough. His new young 
              life, so strong and imperious, was urged towardssomething else. 
              It made him mad with restlessness. She saw this,and wished bitterly 
              that Miriam had been a woman who could take thisnew life of his, 
              and leave her the roots. He fought against his motheralmost as he 
              fought against Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　It was a week before he went again to Willey Farm. Miriam had 
              suffered a great deal, and was afraid to see him again. Was she 
              now to endure the ignominy of his abandoning her? That would only 
              be superficial and temporary. He would come back. She held the keys 
              to his soul. But meanwhile, how he would tortureher with his battle 
              against her. She shrank from it.</p>
            <p>　　However, the Sunday after Easter he came to tea. Mrs. Leiverswas 
              glad to see him. She gathered something was fretting him,that he 
              found things hard. He seemed to drift to her for comfort. And she 
              was good to him. She did him that great kindness of treatinghim 
              almost with reverence.</p>
            <p>　　He met her with the young children in the front garden.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm glad you've come,&quot; said the mother, looking at 
              himwith her great appealing brown eyes. &quot;It is such a sunny 
              day. I was just going down the fields for the first time this year.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He felt she would like him to come. That soothed him. They went,talking 
              simply, he gentle and humble. He could have wept with gratitudethat 
              she was deferential to him. He was feeling humiliated. </p>
            <p>　　At the bottom of the Mow Close they found a thrush's nest.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall I show you the eggs?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do!&quot; replied Mrs. Leivers. &quot;They seem SUCH a 
              sign of spring,and so hopeful.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He put aside the thorns, and took out the eggs, holding themin 
              the palm of his hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They are quite hot--I think we frightened her off them,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, poor thing!&quot; said Mrs. Leivers.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam could not help touching the eggs, and his hand which,it 
              seemed to her, cradled them so well.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it a strange warmth!&quot; she murmured, to get near 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Blood heat,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　She watched him putting them back, his body pressed againstthe 
              hedge, his arm reaching slowly through the thorns, his handfolded 
              carefully over the eggs. He was concentrated on the act. Seeing 
              him so, she loved him; he seemed so simple and sufficientto himself. 
              And she could not get to him.</p>
            <p>　　After tea she stood hesitating at the bookshelf. He took&quot;Tartarin 
              de Tarascon&quot;. Again they sat on the bank of hay at the footof 
              the stack. He read a couple of pages, but without any heart for 
              it. Again the dog came racing up to repeat the fun of the other 
              day. He shoved his muzzle in the man's chest. Paul fingered his 
              earfor a moment. Then he pushed him away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go away, Bill,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't want you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Bill slunk off, and Miriam wondered and dreadedwhat was coming. 
              There was a silence about theyouth that made her still with apprehension. 
              It was not his furies, but his quiet resolutions that she feared.</p>
            <p>　　Turning his face a little to one side, so that she couldnot see 
              him, he began, speaking slowly and painfully:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think--if I didn't come up so much--you might getto 
              like somebody else--another man?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So this was what he was still harping on.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I don't know any other men. Why do you ask?&quot; she 
              replied,in a low tone that should have been a reproach to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; he blurted, &quot;because they say I've no right 
              to come uplike this--without we mean to marry---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was indignant at anybody's forcing the issues between 
              them. She had been furious with her own father for suggesting to 
              Paul,laughingly, that he knew why he came so much.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who says?&quot; she asked, wondering if her people had 
              anythingto do with it. They had not.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother--and the others. They say at this rate everybody 
              willconsider me engaged, and I ought to consider myself so, because 
              it'snot fair to you. And I've tried to find out--and I don't think 
              Ilove you as a man ought to love his wife. What do you think about 
              it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam bowed her head moodily. She was angry at havingthis struggle. 
              People should leave him and her alone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think we love each other enough to marry?&quot;he 
              asked definitely. It made her tremble.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she answered truthfully. &quot;I don't think 
              so--we'retoo young.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought perhaps,&quot; he went on miserably, &quot;that 
              you, with yourintensity in things, might have given me more--than 
              I could ever makeup to you. And even now--if you think it better--we'll 
              be engaged.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Now Miriam wanted to cry. And she was angry, too. He wasalways 
              such a child for people to do as they liked with.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I don't think so,&quot; she said firmly.</p>
            <p>　　He pondered a minute.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;with me--I don't think one 
              person wouldever monopolize me--be everything to me--I think never.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This she did not consider.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she murmured. Then, after a pause, she looked 
              at him,and her dark eyes flashed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This is your mother,&quot; she said. &quot;I know she never 
              liked me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, no, it isn't,&quot; he said hastily. &quot;It was for 
              your sakeshe spoke this time. She only said, if I was going on, 
              I oughtto consider myself engaged.&quot; There was a silence. &quot;And 
              if I askyou to come down any time, you won't stop away, will you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer. By this time she was very angry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, what shall we do?&quot; she said shortly. &quot;I 
              suppose I'dbetter drop French. I was just beginning to get on with 
              it. But I suppose I can go on alone.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't see that we need,&quot; he said. &quot;I can give 
              youa French lesson, surely.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well--and there are Sunday nights. I shan't stop comingto 
              chapel, because I enjoy it, and it's all the social life I get. 
              But you've no need to come home with me. I can go alone.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right,&quot; he answered, rather taken aback. &quot;But 
              if I ask Edgar,he'll always come with us, and then they can say 
              nothing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence. After all, then, she would not lose much. 
              For all their talk down at his home there would not be much difference. 
              She wished they would mind their own business.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you won't think about it, and let it trouble you, will 
              you?&quot;he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh no,&quot; replied Miriam, without looking at him.</p>
            <p>　　He was silent. She thought him unstable. He had no fixityof purpose, 
              no anchor of righteousness that held him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because,&quot; he continued, &quot;a man gets across his 
              bicycle--andgoes to work--and does all sorts of things. But a woman 
              broods.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I shan't bother,&quot; said Miriam. And she meant it.</p>
            <p>　　It had gone rather chilly. They went indoors.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How white Paul looks!&quot; Mrs. Leivers exclaimed. &quot;Miriam, 
              youshouldn't have let him sit out of doors. Do you think you'vetaken 
              cold, Paul?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, no!&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　But he felt done up. It wore him out, the conflict in himself. 
              Miriam pitied him now. But quite early, before nine o'clock, he 
              roseto go.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not going home, are you?&quot; asked Mrs. Leivers 
              anxiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;I said I'd be early.&quot; 
              He was very awkward.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But this IS early,&quot; said Mrs. Leivers.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam sat in the rocking-chair, and did not speak. He hesitated, 
              expecting her to rise and go with him to the barnas usual for his 
              bicycle. She remained as she was. He was at a loss.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well--good-night, all!&quot; he faltered.</p>
            <p>　　She spoke her good-night along with all the others. But as he 
              went past the window he looked in. She saw him pale,his brows knit 
              slightly in a way that had become constant with him,his eyes dark 
              with pain.</p>
            <p>　　She rose and went to the doorway to wave good-bye to him as hepassed 
              through the gate. He rode slowly under the pine-trees,feeling a 
              cur and a miserable wretch. His bicycle went tilting downthe hills 
              at random. He thought it would be a relief to break one's neck.</p>
            <p>　　Two days later he sent her up a book and a little note,urging 
              her to read and be busy.</p>
            <p>　　At this time he gave all his friendship to Edgar. He loved the 
              family so much, he loved the farm so much; it wasthe dearest place 
              on earth to him. His home was not so lovable. It was his mother. 
              But then he would have been just as happy withhis mother anywhere. 
              Whereas Willey Farm he loved passionately. He loved the little pokey 
              kitchen, where men's boots tramped,and the dog slept with one eye 
              open for fear of being trodden on;where the lamp hung over the table 
              at night, and everything was so silent. He loved Miriam's long, 
              low parlour, with its atmosphere of romance,its flowers, its books, 
              its high rosewood piano. He loved the gardensand the buildings that 
              stood with their scarlet roofs on the nakededges of the fields, 
              crept towards the wood as if for cosiness,the wild country scooping 
              down a valley and up the uncultured hills ofthe other side. Only 
              to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him. He loved Mrs. 
              Leivers, with her unworldliness and her quaint cynicism;he loved 
              Mr. Leivers, so warm and young and lovable; he loved Edgar,who lit 
              up when he came, and the boys and the children andBill--even the 
              sow Circe and the Indian game-cock called Tippoo. All this besides 
              Miriam. He could not give it up.</p>
            <p>　　So he went as often, but he was usually with Edgar. Only allthe 
              family, including the father, joined in charades and gamesat evening. 
              And later, Miriam drew them together, and they readMacbeth out of 
              penny books, taking parts. It was great excitement. Miriam was glad, 
              and Mrs. Leivers was glad, and Mr. Leivers enjoyed it. Then they 
              all learned songs together from tonic sol-fa, singingin a circle 
              round the fire. But now Paul was very rarely alonewith Miriam. She 
              waited. When she and Edgar and he walked hometogether from chapel 
              or from the literary society in Bestwood,she knew his talk, so passionate 
              and so unorthodox nowadays,was for her. She did envy Edgar, however, 
              his cycling with Paul,his Friday nights, his days working in the 
              fields. For her Fridaynights and her French lessons were gone. She 
              was nearly always alone,walking, pondering in the wood, reading, 
              studying, dreaming, waiting. And he wrote to her frequently.</p>
            <p>　　One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony. Edgar 
              had stayed to Communion--he wondered what it was like--withMrs. 
              Morel. So Paul came on alone with Miriam to his home. He wasmore 
              or less under her spell again. As usual, they were discussingthe 
              sermon. He was setting now full sail towards Agnosticism,but such 
              a religious Agnosticism that Miriam did not suffer so badly. They 
              were at the Renan Vie de Jesus stage. Miriam was thethreshing-floor 
              on which he threshed out all his beliefs. While hetrampled his ideas 
              upon her soul, the truth came out for him. She alonewas his threshing-floor. 
              She alone helped him towards realization. Almost impassive, she 
              submitted to his argument and expounding.And somehow, because of 
              her, he gradually realized where he was wrong.And what he realized, 
              she realized. She felt he could not do without her.</p>
            <p>　　They came to the silent house. He took the key out ofthe scullery 
              window, and they entered. All the time he wenton with his discussion. 
              He lit the gas, mended the fire,and brought her some cakes from 
              the pantry. She sat on the sofa,quietly, with a plate on her knee. 
              She wore a large white hatwith some pinkish flowers. It was a cheap 
              hat, but he liked it. Her face beneath was still and pensive, golden-brown 
              and ruddy. Always her ears were hid in her short curls. She watched 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　She liked him on Sundays. Then he wore a dark suit that showed 
              thelithe movement of his body. There was a clean, clear-cut look 
              about him. He went on with his thinking to her. Suddenly he reached 
              for a Bible. Miriam liked the way he reached up--so sharp, straight 
              to the mark. He turned the pages quickly, and read her a chapter 
              of St. John. As he sat in the armchair reading, intent, his voice 
              only thinking,she felt as if he were using her unconsciously as 
              a man uses histools at some work he is bent on. She loved it. And 
              the wistfulnessof his voice was like a reaching to something, and 
              it was as if shewere what he reached with. She sat back on the sofa 
              away from him,and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand 
              grasped. It gave her great pleasure.</p>
            <p>　　Then he began to falter and to get self-conscious. And when hecame 
              to the verse, &quot;A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrowbecause 
              her hour is come&quot;, he missed it out. Miriam had felt himgrowing 
              uncomfortable. She shrank when the well-known words didnot follow. 
              He went on reading, but she did not hear. A griefand shame made 
              her bend her head. Six months ago he would haveread it simply. Now 
              there was a scotch in his running with her. Now she felt there was 
              really something hostile between them,something of which they were 
              ashamed.</p>

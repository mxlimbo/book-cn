            <p>　　They were both angry, but she said nothing. The baby beganto 
              cry, and Mrs. Morel, picking up a saucepan from the hearth,accidentally 
              knocked Annie on the head, whereupon the girl beganto whine, and 
              Morel to shout at her. In the midst of this pandemonium,William 
              looked up at the big glazed text over the mantelpieceand read distinctly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;God Bless Our Home!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Whereupon Mrs. Morel, trying to soothe the baby, jumped up,rushed 
              at him, boxed his ears, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are YOU putting in for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And then she sat down and laughed, till tears ran overher cheeks, 
              while William kicked the stool he had been sitting on,and Morel 
              growled:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I canna see what there is so much to laugh at.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　One evening, directly after the parson's visit, feeling unableto 
              bear herself after another display from her husband, she tookAnnie 
              and the baby and went out. Morel had kicked William,and the mother 
              would never forgive him.</p>
            <p>　　She went over the sheep-bridge and across a corner of themeadow 
              to the cricket-ground. The meadows seemed one space of ripe,evening 
              light, whispering with the distant mill-race. She saton a seat under 
              the alders in the cricket-ground, and frontedthe evening. Before 
              her, level and solid,spread the big green cricket-field, like the 
              bed of a sea of light. Children played in the bluish shadow of the 
              pavilion. Many rooks,high up, came cawing home across the softly-woven 
              sky. They stoopedin a long curve down into the golden glow, concentrating, 
              cawing,wheeling, like black flakes on a slow vortex, over a tree 
              clumpthat made a dark boss among the pasture.</p>
            <p>　　A few gentlemen were practising, and Mrs. Morel could hearthe 
              chock of the ball, and the voices of men suddenly roused;could see 
              the white forms of men shifting silently over the green,upon which 
              already the under shadows were smouldering. Away atthe grange, one 
              side of the haystacks was lit up, the other sidesblue-grey. A waggon 
              of sheaves rocked small across the meltingyellow light.</p>
            <p>　　The sun was going down. Every open evening, the hills ofDerbyshire 
              were blazed over with red sunset. Mrs. Morel watched the sunsink 
              from the glistening sky, leaving a soft flower-blue overhead,while 
              the western space went red, as if all the fire had swum down there,leaving 
              the bell cast flawless blue. The mountain-ash berries acrossthe 
              field stood fierily out from the dark leaves, for a moment. A few 
              shocks of corn in a corner of the fallow stood up as if alive;she 
              imagined them bowing; perhaps her son would be a Joseph. In the 
              east, a mirrored sunset floated pink opposite the west's scarlet. 
              The big haystacks on the hillside, that butted into the glare,went 
              cold.</p>
            <p>　　With Mrs. Morel it was one of those still moments when thesmall 
              frets vanish, and the beauty of things stands out, and shehad the 
              peace and the strength to see herself. Now and again,a swallow cut 
              close to her. Now and again, Annie came up with ahandful of alder-currants. 
              The baby was restless on his mother's knee,clambering with his hands 
              at the light.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel looked down at him. She had dreaded this babylike 
              a catastrophe, because of her feeling for her husband. And now she 
              felt strangely towards the infant. Her heart was heavybecause of 
              the child, almost as if it were unhealthy, or malformed. Yet it 
              seemed quite well. But she noticed the peculiar knittingof the baby's 
              brows, and the peculiar heaviness of its eyes,as if it were trying 
              to understand something that was pain. She felt,when she looked 
              at her child's dark, brooding pupils, as if a burden wereon her 
              heart.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He looks as if he was thinking about something--quite sorrowful,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Kirk.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly, looking at him, the heavy feeling at the mother's heartmelted 
              into passionate grief. She bowed over him, and a few tearsshook 
              swiftly out of her very heart. The baby lifted his fingers.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My lamb!&quot; she cried softly.</p>
            <p>　　And at that moment she felt, in some far inner place of her soul,that 
              she and her husband were guilty.</p>
            <p>　　The baby was looking up at her. It had blue eyes like her own,but 
              its look was heavy, steady, as if it had realised somethingthat 
              had stunned some point of its soul.</p>
            <p>　　In her arms lay the delicate baby. Its deep blue eyes,always 
              looking up at her unblinking, seemed to draw her innermostthoughts 
              out of her. She no longer loved her husband; she had notwanted this 
              child to come, and there it lay in her arms and pulledat her heart. 
              She felt as if the navel string that had connectedits frail little 
              body with hers had not been broken. A wave of hotlove went over 
              her to the infant. She held it close to her faceand breast. With 
              all her force, with all her soul she would make upto it for having 
              brought it into the world unloved. She would loveit all the more 
              now it was here; carry it in her love. Its clear,knowing eyes gave 
              her pain and fear. Did it know all about her? When it lay under 
              her heart, had it been listening then? Was therea reproach in the 
              look? She felt the marrow melt in her bones,with fear and pain.</p>
            <p>　　Once more she was aware of the sun lying red on the rimof the 
              hill opposite. She suddenly held up the child in her hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look!&quot; she said. &quot;Look, my pretty!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She thrust the infant forward to the crimson, throbbing sun,almost 
              with relief. She saw him lift his little fist. Then she puthim to 
              her bosom again, ashamed almost of her impulse to give himback again 
              whence he came.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If he lives,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;what will 
              becomeof him--what will he be?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Her heart was anxious.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will call him Paul,&quot; she said suddenly; she knew 
              not why.</p>
            <p>　　After a while she went home. A fine shadow was flung overthe 
              deep green meadow, darkening all.</p>
            <p>　　As she expected, she found the house empty. But Morel washome 
              by ten o'clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.</p>
            <p>　　Walter Morel was, at this time, exceedingly irritable. His work 
              seemed to exhaust him. When he came home he did not speakcivilly 
              to anybody. If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;he 
              grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter heshouted 
              at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil,and made them 
              hate him.</p>
            <p>　　On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock. The babywas 
              unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down. Mrs. Morel,tired 
              to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wish the nuisance would come,&quot; she said wearily 
              to herself.</p>
            <p>　　The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms. She wastoo 
              tired to carry him to the cradle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes,&quot; she 
              said. &quot;It only works me up; I won't say anything. But I know 
              if he doesanything it'll make my blood boil,&quot; she added to 
              herself.</p>
            <p>　　She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something shecould 
              not bear. He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk. She kepther 
              head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him. 
              But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing,he 
              lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and clutchedat 
              the white pot knobs for support. He hung up his hat and coat,then 
              returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she satbowed 
              over the child.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there nothing to eat in the house?&quot; he asked, insolently,as 
              if to a servant. In certain stages of his intoxication heaffected 
              the clipped, mincing speech of the towns. Mrs. Morelhated him most 
              in this condition.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know what there is in the house,&quot; she said, so 
              coldly,it sounded impersonal.</p>
            <p>　　He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer,&quot;he 
              said affectedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you got it,&quot; she said, still ignoring him.</p>
            <p>　　He glowered again. Then he came unsteadily forward. He leaned 
              on the table with one hand, and with the other jerkedat the table 
              drawer to get a knife to cut bread. The drawer stuck because hepulled 
              sideways. In a temper he dragged it, so that it flewout bodily, 
              and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things,splashed with 
              a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor. The baby gave a little 
              convulsed start.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you doing, clumsy, drunken fool?&quot; the mother 
              cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen. Tha should 
              get up,like other women have to, an' wait on a man.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wait on you--wait on you?&quot; she cried. &quot;Yes, I 
              see myself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to. Wait on ME, yes 
              thash'lt wait on me---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never, milord. I'd wait on a dog at the door first.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What--what?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was trying to fit in the drawer. At her last speechbe turned 
              round. His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot. He stared at her 
              one silent second in threat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;P-h!&quot; she went quickly, in contempt.</p>
            <p>　　He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. It fell, cut sharplyon 
              his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.</p>
            <p>　　One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawercrashed 
              into the fireplace. She swayed, almost fell stunned fromher chair. 
              To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the childtightly to her 
              bosom. A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,she brought herself 
              to. The baby was crying plaintively. Her leftbrow was bleeding rather 
              profusely. As she glanced down at the child,her brain reeling, some 
              drops of blood soaked into its white shawl;but the baby was at least 
              not hurt. She balanced her head tokeep equilibrium, so that the 
              blood ran into her eye.</p>
            <p>　　Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table withone 
              hand, looking blank. When he was sufficiently sure of his balance,he 
              went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of herrocking-chair, 
              almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,and swaying 
              as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did it catch thee?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child. With the 
              catastrophe he had lost all balance.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go away,&quot; she said, struggling to keep her presence 
              of mind.</p>
            <p>　　He hiccoughed. &quot;Let's--let's look at it,&quot; he said, 
              hiccoughing again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go away!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Lemme--lemme look at it, lass.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swayinggrasp 
              on the back of her rocking-chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go away,&quot; she said, and weakly she pushed him off.</p>
            <p>　　He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning allher 
              strength she rose, the baby on one arm. By a cruel effort of will,moving 
              as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where shebathed 
              her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too dizzy. Afraid 
              lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair,trembling 
              in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.</p>
            <p>　　Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer backinto 
              its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,for the 
              scattered spoons.</p>
            <p>　　Her brow was still bleeding. Presently Morel got up and camecraning 
              his neck towards her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What has it done to thee, lass?&quot; he asked, in a very 
              wretched,humble tone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can see what it's done,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which graspedhis 
              legs just above the knee. He peered to look at the wound. She drew 
              away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache,averting 
              her own face as much as possible. As he looked at her,who was cold 
              and impassive as stone, with mouth shut tight,he sickened with feebleness 
              and hopelessness of spirit. He was turning drearily away, when he 
              saw a drop of blood fallfrom the averted wound into the baby's fragile, 
              glistening hair. Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang 
              in the glistening cloud,and pull down the gossamer. Another drop 
              fell. It would soakthrough to the baby's scalp. He watched, fascinated, 
              feeling itsoak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What of this child?&quot; was all his wife said to him. 
              But her low, intense tones brought his head lower. She softened: 
              &quot;Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with apad, 
              which she singed before the fire, then put on her forehead,as she 
              sat with the baby on her lap.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now that clean pit-scarf.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning presentlywith 
              a red, narrow scarf. She took it, and with trembling fingersproceeded 
              to bind it round her head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let me tie it for thee,&quot; he said humbly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can do it myself,&quot; she replied. When it was done 
              shewent upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.</p>
            <p>　　In the morning Mrs. Morel said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when Iwas 
              getting a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out.&quot; 
              Her two small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes. 
              They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express theunconscious 
              tragedy they felt.</p>
            <p>　　Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. Hedid 
              not think of the previous evening's work. He scarcely thoughtof 
              anything, but he would not think of that. He lay and suffered likea 
              sulking dog. He had hurt himself most; and he was the more damagedbecause 
              he would never say a word to her, or express his sorrow. He tried 
              to wriggle out of it. &quot;It was her own fault,&quot; he saidto 
              himself. Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousnessinflicting 
              on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust,and which 
              he could only alleviate by drinking.</p>
            <p>　　He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say 
              a word,or to move, but could only lie like a log. Moreover, he had 
              himselfviolent pains in the head. It was Saturday. Towards noon 
              he rose,cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped,then 
              pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clockslightly 
              tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed. He rose again 
              at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.</p>
            <p>　　Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till2.30, 
              dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken. When Mrs. Morelwent upstairs, 
              towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,he was fast asleep. 
              She would have felt sorry for him, if hehad once said, &quot;Wife, 
              I'm sorry.&quot; But no; he insisted to himselfit was her fault. 
              And so he broke himself. So she merely lefthim alone. There was 
              this deadlock of passion between them,and she was stronger.</p>
            <p>　　The family began tea. Sunday was the only day when all satdown 
              to meals together.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't my father going to get up?&quot; asked William.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let him lie,&quot; the mother replied.</p>
            <p>　　There was a feeling of misery over all the house. The childrenbreathed 
              the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They wererather 
              disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.</p>
            <p>　　Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed. That wascharacteristic 
              of him all his life. He was all for activity. The prostrated inactivity 
              of two mornings was stifling him.</p>
            <p>　　It was near six o'clock when he got down. This time he enteredwithout 
              hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again. He 
              did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.</p>
            <p>　　The tea-things were on the table. William was reading aloudfrom 
              &quot;The Child's Own&quot;, Annie listening and asking eternally 
              &quot;why?&quot; Both children hushed into silence as they heard 
              the approachingthud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank 
              as he entered. Yet he was usually indulgent to them.</p>
            <p>　　Morel made the meal alone, brutally. He ate and drankmore noisily 
              than he had need. No one spoke to him. The familylife withdrew, 
              shrank away, and became hushed as he entered. But he cared no longer 
              about his alienation.</p>
            <p>　　Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out. 
              It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickenedMrs. 
              Morel. As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water,heard the 
              eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl,as he wetted 
              his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust. As he bent over,lacing 
              his boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movementthat 
              divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family. He always 
              ran away from the battle with himself. Even in his ownheart's privacy, 
              he excused himself, saying, &quot;If she hadn't saidso-and-so, it 
              would never have happened. She asked for what she's got.&quot; The 
              children waited in restraint during his preparations. When hehad 
              gone, they sighed with relief.</p>
            <p>　　He closed the door behind him, and was glad. It was arainy evening. 
              The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastenedforward in anticipation. 
              All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shoneblack with wet. The roads, 
              always dark with coal-dust, were fullof blackish mud. He hastened 
              along. The Palmerston windows were steamedover. The passage was 
              paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm,if foul, and full of 
              the sound of voices and the smell of beerand smoke.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What shollt ha'e, Walter?&quot; cried a voice, as soon 
              as Morelappeared in the doorway.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, Jim, my lad, wheriver has thee sprung frae?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly. He was glad. 
              In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him,all 
              shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night.</p>
            <p>　　On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless. He dreadedhis 
              wife. Having hurt her, he hated her. He did not know what todo with 
              himself that evening, having not even twopence with whichto go to 
              the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt. So, while 
              his wife was down the garden with the child, he huntedin the top 
              drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found it,and looked 
              inside. It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,and a sixpence. 
              So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully back,and went out.</p>
            <p>　　The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she lookedin 
              the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her shoes. Then 
              she sat down and thought: &quot;WAS there a sixpence? I hadn'tspent 
              it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was much put about. She hunted round everywhere for it. And, 
              as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that herhusband 
              had taken it. What she had in her purse was all the moneyshe possessed. 
              But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable. He had 
              done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him,and 
              at the week-end he had put the shilling again into her purse. So 
              that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time hehad 
              not paid back.</p>
            <p>　　This time she felt it was too much. When he had had his dinner--he 
              came home early that day--she said to him coldly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me!&quot; he said, looking up in an offended way. &quot;No, 
              I didna! I niver clapped eyes on your purse.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But she could detect the lie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, you know you did,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I tell you I didna,&quot; he shouted. &quot;Yer at me again, 
              are yer? I've had about enough on't.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm takingthe 
              clothes in.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll may yer pay for this,&quot; he said, pushing back 
              hischair in desperation. He bustled and got washed, then wentdeterminedly 
              upstairs. Presently he came down dressed,and with a big bundle in 
              a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And now,&quot; he said, &quot;you'll see me again when 
              you do.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It'll be before I want to,&quot; she replied; and at that 
              he marchedout of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,but 
              her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he wentto 
              some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman? But 
              she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him. Nevertheless 
              her heart was gnawed inside her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where's my dad?&quot; said William, coming in from school.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He says he's run away,&quot; replied the mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,and 
              says he's not coming back.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What shall we do?&quot; cried the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, never trouble, he won't go far.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But if he doesn't come back,&quot; wailed Annie.</p>
            <p>　　And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morelsat 
              and laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You pair of gabeys!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You'll see 
              him beforethe night's out.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on. Mrs. 
              Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her saidit would 
              be a relief to see the last of him; another part frettedbecause 
              of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she couldnot quite 
              let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he couldNOT go.</p>
            <p>　　When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,however, 
              she felt something behind the door. So she looked. And there in 
              the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a pieceof coal and 
              laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yetso ignominious, slunk 
              into its corner in the dark, with its endsflopping like dejected 
              ears from the knots, she laughed again. She was relieved.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,so if 
              he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--tired 
              to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundlebeyond 
              the yard-end.</p>
            <p>　　As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the doorand 
              came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word. He took off 
              his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he beganto take off his 
              boots.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots 
              off,&quot;she said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You may thank your stars I've come back to-night,&quot; 
              he said,looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying 
              to be impressive.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get yourparcel 
              through the yard-end,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him. He continued 
              to take his boots off and prepare for bed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief,&quot; she 
              said. &quot;But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the 
              morning.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presentlyand 
              crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs. As Mrs. 
              Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,holding his 
              bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,because 
              she had loved him.</p>

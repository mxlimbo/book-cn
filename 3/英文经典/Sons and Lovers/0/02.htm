            </div>
            <p>　　She said very little to her husband, but her manner hadchanged 
              towards him. Something in her proud, honourable soulhad crystallised 
              out hard as rock.</p>
            <p>　　When October came in, she thought only of Christmas. Two years 
              ago,at Christmas, she had met him. Last Christmas she had married 
              him. This Christmas she would bear him a child.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?&quot; asked hernearest 
              neighbour, in October, when there was great talkof opening a dancing-class 
              over the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No--I never had the least inclination to,&quot; Mrs. Morel 
              replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester. 
              You know he's quite a famous one for dancing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I didn't know he was famous,&quot; laughed Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the 
              Miners'Arms club-room for over five year.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did he?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, he did.&quot; The other woman was defiant. &quot;An' 
              it wasthronged every Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day--an' there 
              WAScarryin's-on, accordin' to all accounts.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel,and 
              she had a fair share of it. The women did not spare her, at first;for 
              she was superior, though she could not help it.</p>
            <p>　　He began to be rather late in coming home.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're working very late now, aren't they?&quot; she said 
              to herwasher-woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No later than they allers do, I don't think. But they stop 
              tohave their pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you 
              are! Dinner stone cold--an' it serves 'em right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But Mr. Morel does not take any drink.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then wenton 
              with her work, saying nothing.</p>
            <p>　　Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born. Morel was 
              good to her, as good as gold. But she felt very lonely,miles away 
              from her own people. She felt lonely with him now,and his presence 
              only made it more intense.</p>
            <p>　　The boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly. 
              He was a beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blueeyes 
              which changed gradually to a clear grey. His mother lovedhim passionately. 
              He came just when her own bitterness ofdisillusion was hardest to 
              bear; when her faith in life was shaken,and her soul felt dreary 
              and lonely. She made much of the child,and the father was jealous.</p>
            <p>　　At last Mrs. Morel despised her husband. She turned tothe child; 
              she turned from the father. He had begun to neglect her;the novelty 
              of his own home was gone. He had no grit, she saidbitterly to herself. 
              What he felt just at the minute, that was all to him.He could not 
              abide by anything. There was nothing at the backof all his show.</p>
            <p>　　There began a battle between the husband and wife--a fearful,bloody 
              battle that ended only with the death of one. She foughtto make 
              him undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfillhis obligations. 
              But he was too different from her. His naturewas purely sensuous, 
              and she strove to make him moral, religious. She tried to force 
              him to face things. He could not endure it--itdrove him out of his 
              mind.</p>
            <p>　　While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had becomeso 
              irritable that it was not to be trusted. The child had only togive 
              a little trouble when the man began to bully. A little more,and 
              the hard hands of the collier hit the baby. Then Mrs. Morelloathed 
              her husband, loathed him for days; and he went out and drank;and 
              she cared very little what he did. Only, on his return,she scathed 
              him with her satire.</p>
            <p>　　The estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly,grossly 
              to offend her where he would not have done.</p>
            <p>　　William was only one year old, and his mother was proud of him,he 
              was so pretty. She was not well off now, but her sisters keptthe 
              boy in clothes. Then, with his little white hat curled with anostrich 
              feather, and his white coat, he was a joy to her, the twiningwisps 
              of hair clustering round his head. Mrs. Morel lay listening,one 
              Sunday morning, to the chatter of the father and child downstairs. 
              Then she dozed off. When she came downstairs, a great fire glowedin 
              the grate, the room was hot, the breakfast was roughly laid,and 
              seated in his armchair, against the chimney-piece, sat Morel,rather 
              timid; and standing between his legs, the child--croppedlike a sheep, 
              with such an odd round poll--looking wondering at her;and on a newspaper 
              spread out upon the hearthrug, a myriad ofcrescent-shaped curls, 
              like the petals of a marigold scattered in thereddening firelight.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel stood still. It was her first baby. She wentvery white, 
              and was unable to speak.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What dost think o' 'im?&quot; Morel laughed uneasily.</p>
            <p>　　She gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward. Morel 
              shrank back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I could kill you, I could!&quot; she said. She choked with 
              rage,her two fists uplifted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im,&quot; Morel said, 
              in afrightened tone, bending his head to shield his eyes from hers. 
              His attempt at laughter had vanished.</p>
            <p>　　The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head ofher 
              child. She put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondledhis 
              head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh--my boy!&quot; she faltered. Her lip trembled, her face 
              broke,and, snatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulderand 
              cried painfully. She was one of those women who cannot cry;whom 
              it hurts as it hurts a man. It was like ripping somethingout of 
              her, her sobbing.</p>
            <p>　　Morel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands grippedtogether 
              till the knuckles were white. He gazed in the fire,feeling almost 
              stunned, as if he could not breathe.</p>
            <p>　　Presently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared awaythe 
              breakfast-table. She left the newspaper, littered with curls,spread 
              upon the hearthrug. At last her husband gathered it up and putit 
              at the back of the fire. She went about her work with closedmouth 
              and very quiet. Morel was subdued. He crept about wretchedly,and 
              his meals were a misery that day. She spoke to him civilly,and never 
              alluded to what he had done. But he felt something finalhad happened.</p>
            <p>　　Afterwards she said she had been silly, that the boy's hairwould 
              have had to be cut, sooner or later. In the end, she evenbrought 
              herself to say to her husband it was just as well he hadplayed barber 
              when he did. But she knew, and Morel knew, that thatact had caused 
              something momentous to take place in her soul. She remembered the 
              scene all her life, as one in which she hadsuffered the most intensely.</p>
            <p>　　This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side 
              ofher love for Morel. Before, while she had striven against him 
              bitterly,she had fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from 
              her. Now she ceased to fret for his love: he was an outsider to 
              her. This made life much more bearable.</p>
            <p>　　Nevertheless, she still continued to strive with him. She stillhad 
              her high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans. It 
              was now a religious instinct, and she was almost a fanaticwith him, 
              because she loved him, or had loved him. If he sinned,she tortured 
              him. If he drank, and lied, was often a poltroon,sometimes a knave, 
              she wielded the lash unmercifully.</p>
            <p>　　The pity was, she was too much his opposite. She could not becontent 
              with the little he might be; she would have him the much thathe 
              ought to be. So, in seeking to make him nobler than he could be,she 
              destroyed him. She injured and hurt and scarred herself,but she 
              lost none of her worth. She also had the children.</p>
            <p>　　He drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners,and 
              always beer, so that whilst his health was affected, it wasnever 
              injured. The week-end was his chief carouse. He sat inthe Miners' 
              Arms until turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday,and every 
              Sunday evening. On Monday and Tuesday he had to get upand reluctantly 
              leave towards ten o'clock. Sometimes he stayed at homeon Wednesday 
              and Thursday evenings, or was only out for an hour. He practically 
              never had to miss work owing to his drinking.</p>
            <p>　　But although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off. 
              He was blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger. Authority was hateful to him,therefore 
              he could only abuse the pit-managers. He would say,in the Palmerston:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e 
              says,'You know, Walter, this 'ere'll not do. What about these props?' 
              An' I says to him, 'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'stmean about 
              th' props?' 'It'll never do, this 'ere,' 'e says. 'You'll be havin' 
              th' roof in, one o' these days.' An' I says,'Tha'd better stan' 
              on a bit o' clunch, then, an' hold it up wi'thy 'ead.' So 'e wor 
              that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an't'other chaps they did laugh.&quot; 
              Morel was a good mimic. He imitatedthe manager's fat, squeaky voice, 
              with its attempt at good English.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'I shan't have it, Walter. Who knows more about it, me 
              or you?' So I says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred. 
              It'll 'appen carry thee ter bed an' back.&quot;'</p>
            <p>　　So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions. 
              And some of this would be true. The pit-manager was not aneducated 
              man. He had been a boy along with Morel, so that,while the two disliked 
              each other, they more or less took eachother for granted. But Alfred 
              Charlesworth did not forgivethe butty these public-house sayings. 
              Consequently, although Morelwas a good miner, sometimes earning 
              as much as five pounds a weekwhen he married, he came gradually 
              to have worse and worse stalls,where the coal was thin, and hard 
              to get, and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>　　Also, in summer, the pits are slack. Often, on bright sunnymornings, 
              the men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelveo'clock. 
              No empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth. The women on thehillside 
              look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence,and count 
              the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley. And 
              the children, as they come from school at dinner-time, lookingdown 
              the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing, say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Minton's knocked off. My dad'll be at home.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and childrenand 
              men, because money will be short at the end of the week.</p>
            <p>　　Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week,to 
              provide everything--rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors. 
              Occasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five. Butthese 
              occasions by no means balanced those when he gave hertwenty-five. 
              In winter, with a decent stall, the miner mightearn fifty or fifty-five 
              shillings a week. Then he was happy. On Friday night, Saturday, 
              and Sunday, he spent royally, getting ridof his sovereign or thereabouts. 
              And out of so much, he scarcelyspared the children an extra penny 
              or bought them a pound of apples. It all went in drink. In the bad 
              times, matters were more worrying,but he was not so often drunk, 
              so that Mrs. Morel used to say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's 
              flush,there isn't a minute of peace.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　If he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five hekept 
              five; from thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept three;from 
              twenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six;from eighteen 
              he kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept sixpence. He never saved 
              a penny, and he gave his wife no opportunityof saving; instead, 
              she had occasionally to pay his debts;not public-house debts, for 
              those never were passed on to the women,but debts when he had bought 
              a canary, or a fancy walking-stick.</p>
            <p>　　At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel was 
              trying to save against her confinement.So it galled her bitterly 
              to think he should be outtaking his pleasure and spending money, 
              whilst she remainedat home, harassed. There were two days' holiday. 
              On the Tuesdaymorning Morel rose early. He was in good spirits. 
              Quite early,before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to 
              himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and 
              musical. He nearly always whistled hymns. He had been a choir-boy 
              witha beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral. 
              His morning whistling alone betrayed it.</p>
            <p>　　His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden,his 
              whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away. It alwaysgave 
              her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she layin bed, 
              the children not yet awake, in the bright early morning,happy in 
              his man's fashion.</p>
            <p>　　At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feetwere 
              sitting playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up,he came 
              in from his carpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoathanging 
              open. He was still a good-looking man, with black,wavy hair, and 
              a large black moustache. His face was perhaps toomuch inflamed, 
              and there was about him a look almost of peevishness. But now he 
              was jolly. He went straight to the sink where his wifewas washing 
              up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What, are thee there!&quot; he said boisterously. &quot;Sluthe 
              off an'let me wesh mysen.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You may wait till I've finished,&quot; said his wife.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　With which he stood watching her a moment, then went awayto wait 
              for her.</p>
            <p>　　When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant. 
              Usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck. Now, 
              however, he made a toilet. There seemed so much gusto in the wayhe 
              puffed and swilled as he washed himself, so much alacrity withwhich 
              he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen, and, bending becauseit 
              was too low for him, scrupulously parted his wet black hair,that 
              it irritated Mrs. Morel. He put on a turn-down collar,a black bow, 
              and wore his Sunday tail-coat. As such, he lookedspruce, and what 
              his clothes would not do, his instinct for makingthe most of his 
              good looks would.</p>
            <p>　　At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal. Jerry 
              was Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him. He was a 
              tall, thin man, with a rather foxy face, the kindof face that seems 
              to lack eyelashes. He walked with a stiff,brittle dignity, as if 
              his head were on a wooden spring. His naturewas cold and shrewd. 
              Generous where he intended to be generous,he seemed to be very fond 
              of Morel, and more or less to take chargeof him.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel hated him. She had known his wife, who had diedof 
              consumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violentdislike 
              of her husband, that if he came into her room it causedher haemorrhage. 
              None of which Jerry had seemed to mind. And nowhis eldest daughter, 
              a girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him,and looked after the 
              two younger children.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!&quot; Mrs. Morel said of 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've never known Jerry mean in MY life,&quot; protested 
              Morel. &quot;A opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find 
              anywhere,accordin' to my knowledge.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Open-handed to you,&quot; retorted Mrs. Morel. &quot;But 
              his fistis shut tight enough to his children, poor things.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I shouldlike 
              to know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.</p>
            <p>　　The subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neckover the 
              scullery curtain. He caught Mrs. Morel's eye.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mornin', missis! Mester in?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--he is.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway. He was 
              not invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly assertingthe rights 
              of men and husbands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A nice day,&quot; he said to Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Grand out this morning--grand for a walk.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you mean YOU'RE going for a walk?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. We mean walkin' to Nottingham,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however,full 
              of assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant 
              inpresence of his wife. But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit. 
              They were going for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham. 
              Climbing the hillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily intothe 
              morning. At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink,then on 
              to the Old Spot. Then a long five miles of drought to carrythem 
              into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter. But they stayedin a field 
              with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full, so that,when they 
              came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy. The townspread upwards 
              before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare,fridging the crest 
              away to the south with spires and factory bulksand chimneys. In 
              the last field Morel lay down under an oak treeand slept soundly 
              for over an hour. When he rose to go forward hefelt queer.</p>
            <p>　　The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister,then repaired 
              to the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitementof pigeon-racing. 
              Morel never in his life played cards, considering themas having 
              some occult, malevolent power--&quot;the devil's pictures,&quot;he 
              called them! But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes. He 
              took a challenge from a Newark man, on skittles. All the men inthe 
              old, long bar took sides, betting either one way or the other. Morel 
              took off his coat. Jerry held the hat containing the money. The 
              men at the tables watched. Some stood with their mugs intheir hands. 
              Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully, then launched it. He played 
              havoc among the nine-pins, and won half a crown,which restored him 
              to solvency.</p>
            <p>　　By seven o'clock the two were in good condition. They caughtthe 
              7.30 train home.</p>
            <p>　　In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable. Every inhabitantremaining 
              was out of doors. The women, in twos and threes,bareheaded and in 
              white aprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks. Men, having 
              a rest between drinks, sat on their heels and talked. The place 
              smelled stale; the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows,which 
              were not more than two hundred yards away. The water ranquickly 
              over stones and broken pots. Mother and child leaned onthe rail 
              of the old sheep-bridge, watching. Up at the dipping-hole,at the 
              other end of the meadow, Mrs. Morel could see the nakedforms of 
              boys flashing round the deep yellow water,or an occasional bright 
              figure dart glittering over the blackishstagnant meadow. She knew 
              William was at the dipping-hole,and it was the dread of her life 
              lest he should get drowned. Annie played under the tall old hedge, 
              picking up alder cones,that she called currants. The child required 
              much attention,and the flies were teasing.</p>
            <p>　　The children were put to bed at seven o'clock. Then sheworked 
              awhile.</p>
            <p>　　When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felta load 
              off their minds; a railway journey no longer impended,so they could 
              put the finishing touches to a glorious day. They entered the Nelson 
              with the satisfaction of returned travellers.</p>
            <p>　　The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damperon 
              the men's spirits. Most of them, moreover, had spent their money. 
              Some were already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparationfor 
              the morrow. Mrs. Morel, listening to their mournful singing,went 
              indoors. Nine o'clock passed, and ten, and still &quot;the pair&quot;had 
              not returned. On a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly,in 
              a drawl: &quot;Lead, kindly Light.&quot; Mrs. Morel was always indignantwith 
              the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when theygot maudlin.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On 
              the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel tooka 
              panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of whitesugar 
              into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the weight,was pouring 
              in the liquor.</p>
            <p>　　Just then Morel came in. He had been very jolly in the Nelson,but 
              coming home had grown irritable. He had not quite got over thefeeling 
              of irritability and pain, after having slept on the groundwhen he 
              was so hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he nearedthe house. 
              He did not know he was angry. But when the garden gateresisted his 
              attempts to open it, he kicked it and broke the latch. He entered 
              just as Mrs. Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs outof the saucepan. 
              Swaying slightly, he lurched against the table. The boiling liquor 
              pitched. Mrs. Morel started back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good gracious,&quot; she cried, &quot;coming home in his 
              drunkenness!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Comin' home in his what?&quot; he snarled, his hat over 
              his eye.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly her blood rose in a jet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Say you're NOT drunk!&quot; she flashed.</p>
            <p>　　She had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugarinto 
              the beer. He dropped his two hands heavily on the table,and thrust 
              his face forwards at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Say you're not drunk,'&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why, nobodybut 
              a nasty little bitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He thrust his face forward at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing 
              else.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing,&quot; she 
              replied. &quot;And,&quot; she cried, flashing into sudden fury, 
              &quot;if you've been spongingon your beloved Jerry, why, let him 
              look after his children,for they need it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a lie, it's a lie. Shut your face, woman.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were now at battle-pitch. Each forgot everything savethe 
              hatred of the other and the battle between them. She was fieryand 
              furious as he. They went on till he called her a liar.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe. 
              &quot;Don't call me that--you, the most despicable liar that ever 
              walkedin shoe-leather.&quot; She forced the last words out of suffocated 
              lungs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're a liar!&quot; he yelled, banging the table with 
              his fist. &quot;You're a liar, you're a liar.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She stiffened herself, with clenched fists.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The house is filthy with you,&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then get out on it--it's mine. Get out on it!&quot; he 
              shouted. &quot;It's me as brings th' money whoam, not thee. It's 
              my house, not thine. Then ger out on't--ger out on't!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I would,&quot; she cried, suddenly shaken into tearsof 
              impotence. &quot;Ah, wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago,but 
              for those children. Ay, haven't I repented not going years ago,when 
              I'd only the one&quot;--suddenly drying into rage. &quot;Do you 
              thinkit's for YOU I stop--do you think I'd stop one minute for YOU?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go, then,&quot; he shouted, beside himself. &quot;Go!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; She faced round. &quot;No,&quot; she cried loudly, 
              &quot;you shan'thave it ALL your own way; you shan't do ALL you 
              like. I've gotthose children to see to. My word,&quot; she laughed, 
              &quot;I should lookwell to leave them to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go,&quot; he cried thickly, lifting his fist. He was afraidof 
              her. &quot;Go!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should be only too glad. I should laugh, laugh, my lord,if 
              I could get away from you,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes,thrust 
              forward, and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him,struggled 
              to be free. Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushedher roughly 
              to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting thebolt behind 
              her with a bang. Then he went back into the kitchen,dropped into 
              his armchair, his head, bursting full of blood,sinking between his 
              knees. Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor,from exhaustion and 
              intoxication.</p>
            <p>　　The moon was high and magnificent in the August night. Mrs. Morel, 
              seared with passion, shivered to find herself out therein a great 
              white light, that fell cold on her, and gave a shockto her inflamed 
              soul. She stood for a few moments helplesslystaring at the glistening 
              great rhubarb leaves near the door. Then she got the air into her 
              breast. She walked down the garden path,trembling in every limb, 
              while the child boiled within her. For a while she could not control 
              her consciousness; mechanically shewent over the last scene, then 
              over it again, certain phrases,certain moments coming each time 
              like a brand red-hot down onher soul; and each time she enacted 
              again the past hour, each timethe brand came down at the same points, 
              till the mark was burnt in,and the pain burnt out, and at last she 
              came to herself. She must have been half an hour in this delirious 
              condition. Then the presence of the night came again to her. She 
              glanced roundin fear. She had wandered to the side garden, where 
              she was walkingup and down the path beside the currant bushes under 
              the long wall. The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from the road, 
              that cuttransversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn hedge.</p>
            <p>　　She hurried out of the side garden to the front, where shecould 
              stand as if in an immense gulf of white light, the moonstreaming 
              high in face of her, the moonlight standing up from thehills in 
              front, and filling the valley where the Bottoms crouched,almost 
              blindingly. There, panting and half weeping in reactionfrom the 
              stress, she murmured to herself over and over again: &quot;The nuisance! 
              the nuisance!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She became aware of something about her. With an effort sheroused 
              herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness. The 
              tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the air wascharged 
              with their perfume, as with a presence. Mrs. Morel gaspedslightly 
              in fear. She touched the big, pallid flowers on their petals,then 
              shivered. They seemed to be stretching in the moonlight. She put 
              her hand into one white bin: the gold scarcely showedon her fingers 
              by moonlight. She bent down to look at the binfulof yellow pollen; 
              but it only appeared dusky. Then she drank a deepdraught of the 
              scent. It almost made her dizzy.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and shelost 
              herself awhile. She did not know what she thought. Except for a 
              slight feeling of sickness, and her consciousness inthe child, herself 
              melted out like scent into the shiny, pale air. After a time the 
              child, too, melted with her in the mixing-potof moonlight, and she 
              rested with the hills and lilies and houses,all swum together in 
              a kind of swoon.</p>
            <p>　　When she came to herself she was tired for sleep. Languidly shelooked 
              about her; the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spreadwith 
              linen; a moth ricochetted over them, and right across the garden. 
              Following it with her eye roused her. A few whiffs of the raw,strong 
              scent of phlox invigorated her. She passed along the path,hesitating 
              at the white rose-bush. It smelled sweet and simple. She touched 
              the white ruffles of the roses. Their fresh scentand cool, soft 
              leaves reminded her of the morning-time and sunshine. She was very 
              fond of them. But she was tired, and wanted to sleep. In the mysterious 
              out-of-doors she felt forlorn.</p>
            <p>　　There was no noise anywhere. Evidently the children had notbeen 
              wakened, or had gone to sleep again. A train, three miles away,roared 
              across the valley. The night was very large, and very strange,stretching 
              its hoary distances infinitely. And out of the silver-greyfog of 
              darkness came sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake notfar off, sound 
              of a train like a sigh, and distant shouts of men.</p>
            <p>　　Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she hurrieddown 
              the side garden to the back of the house. Softly she liftedthe latch; 
              the door was still bolted, and hard against her. She rapped gently, 
              waited, then rapped again. She must not rousethe children, nor the 
              neighbours. He must be asleep, and he wouldnot wake easily. Her 
              heart began to burn to be indoors. She clungto the door-handle. 
              Now it was cold; she would take a chill,and in her present condition!</p>
            <p>　　Putting her apron over her head and her arms, she hurried againto 
              the side garden, to the window of the kitchen. Leaning on the sill,she 
              could just see, under the blind, her husband's arms spreadout on 
              the table, and his black head on the board. He was sleepingwith 
              his face lying on the table. Something in his attitude madeher feel 
              tired of things. The lamp was burning smokily; she couldtell by 
              the copper colour of the light. She tapped at the windowmore and 
              more noisily. Almost it seemed as if the glass would break. Still 
              he did not wake up.</p>
            <p>　　After vain efforts, she began to shiver, partly from contact 
              withthe stone, and from exhaustion. Fearful always for the unborn 
              child,she wondered what she could do for warmth. She went down to 
              thecoal-house, where there was an old hearthrug she had carried 
              out forthe rag-man the day before. This she wrapped over her shoulders. 
              It was warm, if grimy. Then she walked up and down the garden path,peeping 
              every now and then under the blind, knocking, and tellingherself 
              that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him.</p>
            <p>　　At last, after about an hour, she rapped long and low atthe window. 
              Gradually the sound penetrated to him. When, in despair,she had 
              ceased to tap, she saw him stir, then lift his face blindly. The 
              labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness. She rappedimperatively 
              at the window. He started awake. Instantly she saw hisfists set 
              and his eyes glare. He had not a grain of physical fear. If it had 
              been twenty burglars, he would have gone blindly for them. He glared 
              round, bewildered, but prepared to fight.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Open the door, Walter,&quot; she said coldly.</p>
            <p>　　His hands relaxed. It dawned on him what he had done. His head 
              dropped, sullen and dogged. She saw him hurry to the door,heard 
              the bolt chock. He tried the latch. It opened--and therestood the 
              silver-grey night, fearful to him, after the tawny lightof the lamp. 
              He hurried back.</p>
            <p>　　When Mrs. Morel entered, she saw him almostrunning through the 
              door to the stairs. He had rippedhis collar off his neck in his 
              haste to be gone ere shecame in, and there it lay with bursten button-holes. 
              It made her angry.</p>
            <p>　　She warmed and soothed herself. In her weariness forgettingeverything, 
              she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done,set 
              his breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes on thehearth 
              to warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out a cleanscarf 
              and snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed. He 
              was already dead asleep. His narrow black eyebrows were drawnup 
              in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks'down-strokes, 
              and his sulky mouth, seemed to be saying: &quot;I don'tcare who 
              you are nor what you are, I SHALL have my own way.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel knew him too well to look at him. As she unfastenedher 
              brooch at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her faceall smeared 
              with the yellow dust of lilies. She brushed it off,and at last lay 
              down. For some time her mind continued snappingand jetting sparks, 
              but she was asleep before her husband awokefrom the first sleep 
              of his drunkenness.</p>

            <p>　　Beatrice put her tongue between her teeth and laughed wickedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Among other things,' 'Postle?&quot; she repeated. &quot;Do 
              you meanlove laughs at mothers, and fathers, and sisters, and brothers,and 
              men friends, and lady friends, and even at the b'loved himself?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She affected a great innocence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In fact, it's one big smile,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Up its sleeve, 'Postle Morel--you believe me,&quot; she 
              said;and she went off into another burst of wicked, silent laughter.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam sat silent, withdrawn into herself. Every one of Paul'sfriends 
              delighted in taking sides against her, and he left herin the lurch--seemed 
              almost to have a sort of revenge upon her then.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you still at school?&quot; asked Miriam of Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've not had your notice, then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I expect it at Easter.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it an awful shame, to turn you off merely because 
              youdidn't pass the exam.?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Beatrice coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Agatha says you're as good as any teacher anywhere. It 
              seems to me ridiculous. I wonder why you didn't pass.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Short of brains, eh, 'Postle?&quot; said Beatrice briefly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only brains to bite with,&quot; replied Paul, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nuisance!&quot; she cried; and, springing from her seat,she 
              rushed and boxed his ears. She had beautiful small hands. He held 
              her wrists while she wrestled with him. At last shebroke free, and 
              seized two handfuls of his thick, dark brown hair,which she shook.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Beat!&quot; he said, as he pulled his hair straight with 
              his fingers. &quot;I hate you!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed with glee.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mind!&quot; she said. &quot;I want to sit next to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'd as lief be neighbours with a vixen,&quot; he said,nevertheless 
              making place for her between him and Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!&quot; she cried; and, 
              with herhair-comb, she combed him straight. &quot;And his nice little 
              moustache!&quot;she exclaimed. She tilted his head back and combed 
              his young moustache. &quot;It's a wicked moustache, 'Postle,&quot; 
              she said. &quot;It's a red for danger. Have you got any of those 
              cigarettes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He pulled his cigarette-case from his pocket. Beatrice lookedinside 
              it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And fancy me having Connie's last cig.,&quot; said Beatrice,putting 
              the thing between her teeth. He held a lit match to her,and she 
              puffed daintily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thanks so much, darling,&quot; she said mockingly.</p>
            <p>　　It gave her a wicked delight.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you think he does it nicely, Miriam?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very!&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　He took a cigarette for himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Light, old boy?&quot; said Beatrice, tilting her cigarette 
              at him.</p>
            <p>　　He bent forward to her to light his cigarette at hers. She was 
              winking at him as he did so. Miriam saw his eyes tremblingwith mischief, 
              and his full, almost sensual, mouth quivering. He was not himself, 
              and she could not bear it. As he was now,she had no connection with 
              him; she might as well not have existed. She saw the cigarette dancing 
              on his full red lips. She hated his thickhair for being tumbled 
              loose on his forehead.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sweet boy!&quot; said Beatrice, tipping up his chin and 
              givinghim a little kiss on the cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'll kiss thee back, Beat,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha wunna!&quot; she giggled, jumping up and going away. 
              &quot;Isn't he shameless, Miriam?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Quite,&quot; said Miriam. &quot;By the way, aren't you 
              forgettingthe bread?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;By Jove!&quot; he cried, flinging open the oven door.</p>
            <p>　　Out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, golly!&quot; cried Beatrice, coming to his side. He 
              crouchedbefore the oven, she peered over his shoulder. &quot;This 
              is what comesof the oblivion of love, my boy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul was ruefully removing the loaves. One was burnt blackon 
              the hot side; another was hard as a brick.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Poor mater!&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You want to grate it,&quot; said Beatrice. &quot;Fetch 
              me the nutmeg-grater.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She arranged the bread in the oven. He brought the grater,and 
              she grated the bread on to a newspaper on the table. He set the 
              doors open to blow away the smell of burned bread. Beatrice grated 
              away, puffing her cigarette, knocking the charcoal offthe poor loaf.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My word, Miriam! you're in for it this time,&quot; said 
              Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I!&quot; exclaimed Miriam in amazement.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd better be gone when his mother comes in. I know whyKing 
              Alfred burned the cakes. Now I see it! 'Postle would fix upa tale 
              about his work making him forget, if he thought it would wash. If 
              that old woman had come in a bit sooner, she'd have boxed thebrazen 
              thing's ears who made the oblivion, instead of poor Alfred's.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She giggled as she scraped the loaf. Even Miriam laughedin spite 
              of herself. Paul mended the fire ruefully.</p>
            <p>　　The garden gate was heard to bang.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Quick!&quot; cried Beatrice, giving Paul the scraped loaf. 
              &quot;Wrap it up in a damp towel.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul disappeared into the scullery. Beatrice hastilyblew her 
              scrapings into the fire, and sat down innocently. Annie came bursting 
              in. She was an abrupt, quite smart young woman. She blinked in the 
              strong light.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Smell of burning!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's the cigarettes,&quot; replied Beatrice demurely.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where's Paul?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Leonard had followed Annie. He had a long comic faceand blue 
              eyes, very sad.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose he's left you to settle it between you,&quot; 
              he said. He nodded sympathetically to Miriam, and became gently 
              sarcasticto Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Beatrice, &quot;he's gone off with number 
              nine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I just met number five inquiring for him,&quot; said Leonard.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--we're going to share him up like Solomon's baby,&quot;said 
              Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　Annie laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, ay,&quot; said Leonard. &quot;And which bit should 
              you have?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Beatrice. &quot;I'll let all the 
              otherspick first.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' you'd have the leavings, like?&quot; said Leonard, 
              twisting upa comic face.</p>
            <p>　　Annie was looking in the oven. Miriam sat ignored. Paul entered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This bread's a fine sight, our Paul,&quot; said Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then you should stop an' look after it,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean YOU should do what you're reckoning to do,&quot;replied 
              Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He should, shouldn't he!&quot; cried Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'd think he'd got plenty on hand,&quot; said Leonard.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You had a nasty walk, didn't you, Miriam?&quot; said Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--but I'd been in all week---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you wanted a bit of a change, like,&quot; insinuated 
              Leonard kindly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you can't be stuck in the house for ever,&quot; Annie 
              agreed. She was quite amiable. Beatrice pulled on her coat, and 
              went outwith Leonard and Annie. She would meet her own boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't forget that bread, our Paul,&quot; cried Annie. &quot;Good-night, 
              Miriam. I don't think it will rain.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　When they had all gone, Paul fetched the swathed loaf,unwrapped 
              it, and surveyed it sadly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a mess!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; answered Miriam impatiently, &quot;what is it,after 
              all--twopence, ha'penny.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, but--it's the mater's precious baking, and she'll 
              takeit to heart. However, it's no good bothering.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He took the loaf back into the scullery. There was a littledistance 
              between him and Miriam. He stood balanced opposite her forsome moments 
              considering, thinking of his behaviour with Beatrice. He felt guilty 
              inside himself, and yet glad. For some inscrutablereason it served 
              Miriam right. He was not going to repent. She wondered what he was 
              thinking of as he stood suspended. His thick hair was tumbled over 
              his forehead. Why might she notpush it back for him, and remove 
              the marks of Beatrice's comb? Why might she not press his body with 
              her two hands. It lookedso firm, and every whit living. And he would 
              let other girls,why not her?</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly he started into life. It made her quiver almostwith 
              terror as he quickly pushed the hair off his forehead and cametowards 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Half-past eight!&quot; he said. &quot;We'd better buck 
              up. Where's your French?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercise-book.Every 
              week she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life,in her 
              own French. He had found this was the only way to get herto do compositions. 
              And her diary was mostly a love-letter. Hewould read it now; she 
              felt as if her soul's history were goingto be desecrated by him 
              in his present mood. He sat beside her. She watched his hand, firm 
              and warm, rigorously scoring her work. He was reading only the French, 
              ignoring her soul that was there. But gradually his hand forgot 
              its work. He read in silence, motionless. She quivered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Ce matin les oiseaux m'ont eveille,'&quot; he read. &quot;'Il 
              faisaitencore un crepuscule. Mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre 
              etait bleme,et puis, jaune, et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent 
              dans un chansonvif et resonnant. Toute l'aube tressaillit. J'avais 
              reve de vous. Est-ce que vous voyez aussi l'aube? Les oiseaux m'eveillent 
              presquetous les matins, et toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur 
              dansle cri des grives. Il est si clair---'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam sat tremulous, half ashamed. He remained quite still,trying 
              to understand. He only knew she loved him. He was afraidof her love 
              for him. It was too good for him, and he was inadequate. His own 
              love was at fault, not hers. Ashamed, he corrected her work,humbly 
              writing above her words.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;the past participle 
              conjugatedwith avoir agrees with the direct object when it precedes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She bent forward, trying to see and to understand. Her free,fine 
              curls tickled his face. He started as if they had been red hot,shuddering. 
              He saw her peering forward at the page, her red lips partedpiteously, 
              the black hair springing in fine strands across her tawny,ruddy 
              cheek. She was coloured like a pomegranate for richness. His breath 
              came short as he watched her. Suddenly she looked up at him. Her 
              dark eyes were naked with their love, afraid, and yearning. His 
              eyes, too, were dark, and they hurt her. They seemed to master her. 
              She lost all her self-control, was exposed in fear. And he knew,before 
              he could kiss her, he must drive something out of himself. And a 
              touch of hate for her crept back again into his heart. He returned 
              to her exercise.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly he flung down the pencil, and was at the ovenin a leap, 
              turning the bread. For Miriam he was too quick. She started violently, 
              and it hurt her with real pain. Even the wayhe crouched before the 
              oven hurt her. There seemed to be somethingcruel in it, something 
              cruel in the swift way he pitched the breadout of the tins, caught 
              it up again. If only he had been gentlein his movements she would 
              have felt so rich and warm. As it was,she was hurt.</p>
            <p>　　He returned and finished the exercise.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've done well this week,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She saw he was flattered by her diary. It did not repayher entirely.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You really do blossom out sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;You 
              oughtto write poetry.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She lifted her head with joy, then she shook it mistrustfully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't trust myself,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You should try!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Again she shook her head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we read, or is it too late?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is late--but we can read just a little,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　She was really getting now the food for her life duringthe next 
              week. He made her copy Baudelaire's &quot;Le Balcon&quot;. Then 
              heread it for her. His voice was soft and caressing, but growingalmost 
              brutal. He had a way of lifting his lips and showinghis teeth, passionately 
              and bitterly, when he was much moved. This he did now. It made Miriam 
              feel as if he were trampling on her. She dared not look at him, 
              but sat with her head bowed. She couldnot understand why he got 
              into such a tumult and fury. It made her wretched. She did not like 
              Baudelaire, on the whole--nor Verlaine.</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;Behold her singing in the field Yon solitary highland 
              lass.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　That nourished her heart. So did &quot;Fair Ines&quot;. And--</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;It was a beauteous evening, calm and pure, And breathing 
              holy quiet like a nun.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　These were like herself. And there was he, saying in histhroat 
              bitterly:</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;Tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The poem was finished; he took the bread out of the oven,arranging 
              the burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion,the good ones at 
              the top. The desiccated loaf remained swathedup in the scullery.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mater needn't know till morning,&quot; he said. &quot;It 
              won't upsether so much then as at night.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam looked in the bookcase, saw what postcards and lettershe 
              had received, saw what books were there. She took one that hadinterested 
              him. Then he turned down the gas and they set off. He did not trouble 
              to lock the door.</p>
            <p>　　He was not home again until a quarter to eleven. His motherwas 
              seated in the rocking-chair. Annie, with a rope of hair hangingdown 
              her back, remained sitting on a low stool before the fire,her elbows 
              on her knees, gloomily. On the table stood the offendingloaf unswathed. 
              Paul entered rather breathless. No one spoke. His mother was reading 
              the little local newspaper. He took offhis coat, and went to sit 
              down on the sofa. His mother moved curtlyaside to let him pass. 
              No one spoke. He was very uncomfortable. For some minutes he sat 
              pretending to read a piece of paper he found onthe table. Then---</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I forgot that bread, mother,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　There was no answer from either woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;it's only twopence ha'penny. 
              I can pay youfor that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Being angry, he put three pennies on the table and slidthem towards 
              his mother. She turned away her head. Her mouthwas shut tightly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Annie, &quot;you don't know how badly my 
              mother is!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The girl sat staring glumly into the fire.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why is she badly?&quot; asked Paul, in his overbearing 
              way.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well!&quot; said Annie. &quot;She could scarcely get home.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked closely at his mother. She looked ill.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;WHY could you scarcely get home?&quot; he asked her, still 
              sharply. She would not answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I found her as white as a sheet sitting here,&quot; said 
              Annie,with a suggestion of tears in her voice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, WHY?&quot; insisted Paul. His brows were knitting, 
              his eyesdilating passionately.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was enough to upset anybody,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, 
              &quot;huggingthose parcels--meat, and green-groceries, and a pair 
              of curtains---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, why DID you hug them; you needn't have done.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then who would?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let Annie fetch the meat.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, and I WOULD fetch the meat, but how was I to know. 
              You were off with Miriam, instead of being in when my mother came.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what was the matter with you?&quot; asked Paul of his 
              mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose it's my heart,&quot; she replied. Certainly she 
              lookedbluish round the mouth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And have you felt it before?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--often enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why haven't you told me?--and why haven't you seen 
              a doctor?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel shifted in her chair, angry with him for his hectoring.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd never notice anything,&quot; said Annie. &quot;You're 
              too eagerto be off with Miriam.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, am I--and any worse than you with Leonard?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was in at a quarter to ten.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence in the room for a time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should have thought,&quot; said Mrs. Morel bitterly, 
              &quot;that shewouldn't have occupied you so entirely as to burn 
              a whole ovenfulof bread.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Beatrice was here as well as she.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very likely. But we know why the bread is spoilt.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; he flashed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because you were engrossed with Miriam,&quot; replied Mrs. 
              Morel hotly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well--then it was NOT!&quot; he replied angrily.</p>
            <p>　　He was distressed and wretched. Seizing a paper, he beganto read. 
              Annie, her blouse unfastened, her long ropes of hair twistedinto 
              a plait, went up to bed, bidding him a very curt good-night.</p>
            <p>　　Paul sat pretending to read. He knew his mother wantedto upbraid 
              him. He also wanted to know what had made her ill,for he was troubled. 
              So, instead of running away to bed, as he wouldhave liked to do, 
              he sat and waited. There was a tense silence. The clock ticked loudly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd better go to bed before your father comes in,&quot; 
              said themother harshly. &quot;And if you're going to have anything 
              to eat,you'd better get it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't want anything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was his mother's custom to bring him some trifle forsupper 
              on Friday night, the night of luxury for the colliers. He was too 
              angry to go and find it in the pantry this night. This insulted 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If I WANTED you to go to Selby on Friday night, I can imaginethe 
              scene,&quot; said Mrs. Morel. &quot;But you're never too tired to 
              goif SHE will come for you. Nay, you neither want to eat nor drink 
              then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't let her go alone.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can't you? And why does she come?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not because I ask her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She doesn't come without you want her---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, what if I DO want her---&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, nothing, if it was sensible or reasonable. But to 
              gotrapseing up there miles and miles in the mud, coming home at 
              midnight,and got to go to Nottingham in the morning---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If I hadn't, you'd be just the same.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I should, because there's no sense in it. Is she so 
              fascinating that you must follow her all that way?&quot; Mrs. Morel 
              was bitterly sarcastic. She sat still, with averted face,stroking 
              with a rhythmic, jerked movement, the black sateenof her apron. 
              It was a movement that hurt Paul to see.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do like her,&quot; he said, &quot;but---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;LIKE her!&quot; said Mrs. Morel, in the same biting tones. 
              &quot;It seemsto me you like nothing and nobody else. There's neither 
              Annie,nor me, nor anyone now for you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What nonsense, mother--you know I don't love her--I--I 
              tellyou I DON'T love her--she doesn't even walk with my arm, because 
              Idon't want her to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why do you fly to her so often?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I DO like to talk to her--I never said I didn't. But I 
              DON'Tlove her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there nobody else to talk to?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not about the things we talk of. There's a lot of thingsthat 
              you're not interested in, that---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What things?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel was so intense that Paul began to pant.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why--painting--and books. YOU don't care about Herbert 
              Spencer.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; was the sad reply. &quot;And YOU won't at my 
              age.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, but I do now--and Miriam does---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how do you know,&quot; Mrs. Morel flashed defiantly, 
              &quot;that Ishouldn't. Do you ever try me!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you don't, mother, you know you don't care whethera 
              picture's decorative or not; you don't care what MANNER it is in.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How do you know I don't care? Do you ever try me? Do youever 
              talk to me about these things, to try?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it's not that that matters to you, mother, you knowt's 
              not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it, then--what is it, then, that matters to me?&quot;she 
              flashed. He knitted his brows with pain.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're old, mother, and we're young.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He only meant that the interests of HER age were not theinterests 
              of his. But he realised the moment he had spokenthat he had said 
              the wrong thing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I know it well--I am old. And therefore I may stand 
              aside;I have nothing more to do with you. You only want me to wait 
              onyou--the rest is for Miriam.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He could not bear it. Instinctively he realised that hewas life 
              to her. And, after all, she was the chief thing to him,the only 
              supreme thing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know it isn't, mother, you know it isn't!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was moved to pity by his cry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It looks a great deal like it,&quot; she said, half putting 
              asideher despair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, mother--I really DON'T love her. I talk to her, but 
              Iwant to come home to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He had taken off his collar and tie, and rose, bare-throated,to 
              go to bed. As he stooped to kiss his mother, she threw herarms round 
              his neck, hid her face on his shoulder, and cried,in a whimpering 
              voice, so unlike her own that he writhed in agony:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't bear it. I could let another woman--but not her. 
              She'd leave me no room, not a bit of room---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And immediately he hated Miriam bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I've never--you know, Paul--I've never had a husband--not 
              really---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And she exults so in taking you from me--she's not likeordinary 
              girls.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I don't love her, mother,&quot; he murmured, bowing 
              his headand hiding his eyes on her shoulder in misery. His mother 
              kissedhim a long, fervent kiss.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My boy!&quot; she said, in a voice trembling with passionate 
              love.</p>
            <p>　　Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There,&quot; said his mother, &quot;now go to bed. You'll 
              be so tiredin the morning.&quot; As she was speaking she heard her 
              husband coming. &quot;There's your father--now go.&quot; Suddenly 
              she looked at him almostas if in fear. &quot;Perhaps I'm selfish. 
              If you want her, take her,my boy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mother looked so strange, Paul kissed her, trembling.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha--mother!&quot; he said softly.</p>
            <p>　　Morel came in, walking unevenly. His hat was over one cornerof 
              his eye. He balanced in the doorway.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At your mischief again?&quot; he said venomously.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel's emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkardwho 
              had come in thus upon her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At any rate, it is sober,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm--h'm! h'm--h'm!&quot; he sneered. He went into the 
              passage,hung up his hat and coat. Then they heard him go down three 
              stepsto the pantry. He returned with a piece of pork-pie in his 
              fist. It was what Mrs. Morel had bought for her son.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nor was that bought for you. If you can give me no more 
              thantwenty-five shillings, I'm sure I'm not going to buy you pork-pieto 
              stuff, after you've swilled a bellyful of beer.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wha-at--wha-at!&quot; snarled Morel, toppling in his balance. 
              &quot;Wha-at--not for me?&quot; He looked at the piece of meat and 
              crust,and suddenly, in a vicious spurt of temper, flung it into 
              the fire.</p>
            <p>　　Paul started to his feet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Waste your own stuff!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What--what!&quot; suddenly shouted Morel, jumping up and 
              clenchinghis fist. &quot;I'll show yer, yer young jockey!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right!&quot; said Paul viciously, putting his head 
              on one side. &quot;Show me!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smackat something. 
              Morel was half crouching, fists up, ready to spring. The young man 
              stood, smiling with his lips.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ussha!&quot; hissed the father, swiping round with a great 
              strokejust past his son's face. He dared not, even though so close,really 
              touch the young man, but swerved an inch away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Right!&quot; said Paul, his eyes upon the side of his father'smouth, 
              where in another instant his fist would have hit. He ached for that 
              stroke. But he heard a faint moan from behind. His mother was deadly 
              pale and dark at the mouth. Morel wasdancing up to deliver another 
              blow.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Father!&quot; said Paul, so that the word rang.</p>
            <p>　　Morel started, and stood at attention.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother!&quot; moaned the boy. &quot;Mother!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She began to struggle with herself. Her open eyes watched him,although 
              she could not move. Gradually she was coming to herself. He laid 
              her down on the sofa, and ran upstairs for a little whisky,which 
              at last she could sip. The tears were hopping down his face. As 
              he kneeled in front of her he did not cry, but the tears randown 
              his face quickly. Morel, on the opposite side of the room,sat with 
              his elbows on his knees glaring across.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's a-matter with 'er?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Faint!&quot; replied Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The elderly man began to unlace his boots. He stumbled offto 
              bed. His last fight was fought in that home.</p>
            <p>　　Paul kneeled there, stroking his mother's hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't be poorly, mother--don't be poorly!&quot; he said 
              timeafter time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's nothing, my boy,&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　At last he rose, fetched in a large piece of coal, and rakedthe 
              fire. Then he cleared the room, put everything straight,laid the 
              things for breakfast, and brought his mother's candle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can you go to bed, mother?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I'll come.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sleep with Annie, mother, not with him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. I'll sleep in my own bed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't sleep with him, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll sleep in my own bed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She rose, and he turned out the gas, then followed her closelyupstairs, 
              carrying her candle. On the landing he kissed her close.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery. And 
              yet, somewhere in his soul, he was at peace because he stillloved 
              his mother best. It was the bitter peace of resignation.</p>
            <p>　　The efforts of his father to conciliate him next day werea great 
              humiliation to him.</p>
            <p>　　Everybody tried to forget the scene.</p>

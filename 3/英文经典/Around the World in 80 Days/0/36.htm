              <p>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG'S NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON 'CHANGE 
              </p>
              <p>　　 It is time to relate what a change took place in English public 
                opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain 
                James Strand, had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, 
                at Edinburgh. Three days before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, 
                who was being desperately followed up by the police; now he was 
                an honourable gentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric 
                journey round the world. </p>
              <p>　　The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those 
                who had laid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, 
                as if by magic; the &quot;Phileas Fogg bonds&quot; again became 
                negotiable, and many new wagers were made. Phileas Fogg's name 
                was once more at a premium on 'Change. </p>
              <p>　　His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days 
                in a state of feverish suspense. Would Phileas Fogg, whom they 
                had forgotten, reappear before their eyes! Where was he at this 
                moment? The 17th of December, the day of James Strand's arrest, 
                was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg's departure, and no news 
                of him had been received. Was he dead? Had he abandoned the effort, 
                or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon? 
                And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter 
                before nine in the evening, on the threshold of the Reform Club 
                saloon? </p>
              <p>　　The anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, 
                cannot be described. Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for 
                news of Phileas Fogg. Messengers were dispatched to the house 
                in Saville Row morning and evening. No news. The police were ignorant 
                what had become of the detective, Fix, who had so unfortunately 
                followed up a false scent. Bets increased, nevertheless, in number 
                and value. Phileas Fogg, like a racehorse, was drawing near his 
                last turning-point. The bonds were quoted, no longer at a hundred 
                below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at five; and paralytic old 
                Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour. </p>
              <p>　　A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring 
                streets on Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers 
                permanently established around the Reform Club. Circulation was 
                impeded, and everywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions 
                were going on. The police had great difficulty in keeping back 
                the crowd, and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, 
                the excitement rose to its highest pitch. </p>
              <p>　　The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon 
                of the club. John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, the bankers, 
                Andrew Stuart, the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the 
                Bank of England, and Thomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all 
                waited anxiously. </p>
              <p>　　When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew 
                Stuart got up, saying, &quot;Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the 
                time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?&quot; 
                asked Thomas Flanagan. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At twenty-three minutes past seven,&quot; replied Gauthier 
                Ralph; &quot;and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after 
                twelve.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; resumed Andrew Stuart, &quot;if 
                Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train, he would have got here 
                by this time. We can, therefore, regard the bet as won.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Wait; don't let us be too hasty,&quot; replied Samuel 
                Fallentin. &quot;You know that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric. His 
                punctuality is well known; he never arrives too soon, or too late; 
                and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the 
                last minute.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; said Andrew Stuart nervously, &quot;if I should 
                see him, I should not believe it was he.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The fact is,&quot; resumed Thomas Flanagan, &quot;Mr. 
                Fogg's project was absurdly foolish. Whatever his punctuality, 
                he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur; and 
                a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Observe, too,&quot; added John Sullivan, &quot;that we 
                have received no intelligence from him, though there are telegraphic 
                lines all along is route.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;He has lost, gentleman,&quot; said Andrew Stuart, &quot;he 
                has a hundred times lost! You know, besides, that the China the 
                only steamer he could have taken from New York to get here in 
                time arrived yesterday. I have seen a list of the passengers, 
                and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among them. Even if we admit 
                that fortune has favoured him, he can scarcely have reached America. 
                I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand, and that 
                Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is clear,&quot; replied Gauthier Ralph; &quot;and 
                we have nothing to do but to present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings 
                to-morrow.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty 
                minutes to nine. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Five minutes more,&quot; said Andrew Stuart. </p>
              <p>　　The five gentlemen looked at each other. Their anxiety was 
                becoming intense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily 
                assented to Mr. Fallentin's proposal of a rubber. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet,&quot; 
                said Andrew Stuart, as he took his seat, &quot;for three thousand 
                nine hundred and ninety-nine.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine. </p>
              <p>　　The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes 
                off the clock. Certainly, however secure they felt, minutes had 
                never seemed so long to them! </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Seventeen minutes to nine,&quot; said Thomas Flanagan, 
                as he cut the cards which Ralph handed to him. </p>
              <p>　　Then there was a moment of silence. The great saloon was perfectly 
                quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now 
                and then a shrill cry. The pendulum beat the seconds, which each 
                player eagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sixteen minutes to nine!&quot; said John Sullivan, in 
                a voice which betrayed his emotion. </p>
              <p>　　One minute more, and the wager would be won. Andrew Stuart 
                and his partners suspended their game. They left their cards, 
                and counted the seconds. </p>
              <p>　　At the fortieth second, nothing. At the fiftieth, still nothing. 
              </p>
              <p>　　At the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed 
                by applause, hurrahs, and some fierce growls. </p>
              <p>　　The players rose from their seats. </p>
              <p>　　At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; 
                and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas 
                Fogg appeared, followed by an excited crowd who had forced their 
                way through the club doors, and in his calm voice, said, &quot;Here 
                I am, gentlemen!&quot; </p>

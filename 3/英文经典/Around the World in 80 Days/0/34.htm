              <p>　　<b>IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON </b></p>
              <p>　　 Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom 
                House, and he was to he transferred to London the next day. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen 
                upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was 
                thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not 
                understand. Passepartout explained to her how it was that the 
                honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young 
                woman's heart revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she 
                saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector, 
                she wept bitterly. </p>
              <p>　　As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, 
                whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not. </p>
              <p>　　The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause 
                of this new misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix's errand from 
                his master? When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, 
                why had he not told Mr. Fogg? If the latter had been warned, he 
                would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied 
                him of his mistake; at least, Fix would not have continued his 
                journey at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to 
                arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil. Passepartout 
                wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains out. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico 
                of the Custom House. Neither wished to leave the place; both were 
                anxious to see Mr. Fogg again. </p>
              <p>　　That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when 
                he was about to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having 
                arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st 
                of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to 
                reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the 
                journey from Liverpool to London was six hours. </p>
              <p>　　If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he 
                would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without 
                apparent anger, upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; 
                but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal 
                of any emotion. Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, 
                all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst 
                forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one 
                could tell. There he sat, calmly waiting--for what? Did he still 
                cherish hope? Did he still believe, now that the door of this 
                prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed? </p>
              <p>　　However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch 
                upon the table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped 
                his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern. The situation, 
                in any event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if 
                Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was 
                caught. </p>
              <p>　　Did escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were 
                any practicable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping 
                from it? Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. 
                But the door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron 
                rods. He sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket. 
                On the line where these words were written, &quot;21st December, 
                Saturday, Liverpool,&quot; he added, &quot;80th day, 11.40 a.m.,&quot; 
                and waited. </p>
              <p>　　The Custom House clock struck one. Mr. Fogg observed that his 
                watch was two hours too fast. </p>
              <p>　　Two hours! Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express 
                train, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter 
                before nine, p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled. </p>
              <p>　　At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise 
                outside, then a hasty opening of doors. Passepartout's voice was 
                audible, and immediately after that of Fix. Phileas Fogg's eyes 
                brightened for an instant. </p>
              <p>　　The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, 
                who hurried towards him. </p>
              <p>　　Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder. He could 
                not speak. &quot;Sir,&quot; he stammered, &quot;sir--forgive me--most-- 
                unfortunate resemblance-- robber arrested three days ago--you 
                are free!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was free! He walked to the detective, looked him 
                steadily in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever 
                made in his life, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, 
                and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well hit!&quot; cried Passepartout, &quot;Parbleu! that's 
                what you might call a good application of English fists!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word. 
                He had only received his deserts. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout 
                left the Custom House without delay, got into a cab, and in a 
                few moments descended at the station. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave 
                for London. It was forty minutes past two. The express train had 
                left thirty-five minutes before. Phileas Fogg then ordered a special 
                train. </p>
              <p>　　There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway 
                arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three 
                o'clock. </p>
              <p>　　At that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by 
                the offer of a generous reward, at last set out towards London 
                with Aouda and his faithful servant. </p>
              <p>　　It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; 
                and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout. But 
                there were forced delays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train 
                at the terminus, all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes 
                before nine.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Having made the tour of the world, he was behind-hand five 
                minutes. He had lost the wager! </p>

              <p><b>　　IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS 
                TO THE DESIGNS OF PHILEAS FOGG </b></p>
              <p>　　 The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred 
                and ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the steamers 
                one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it. The 
                Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed 
                likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably 
                within that time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi 
                were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way 
                of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses 
                the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials 
                and military officers of various grades, the latter being either 
                attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy 
                troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government 
                has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants 
                get 280 pounds, brigadiers, 2,400 pounds, and generals of divisions, 
                4,000 pounds. What with the military men, a number of rich young 
                Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the 
                purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia. The best of fare 
                was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, 
                and the eight o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed 
                their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when 
                the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games. </p>
              <p>　　But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like 
                most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African 
                or Asian coast the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled fearfully. 
                Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; 
                singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed 
                straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of 
                Bab-el-Mandeb. What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might 
                be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching 
                the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows--every 
                chance, in short, which might force the Mongolia to slacken her 
                speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But, if he thought of these 
                possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom 
                no incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship's chronometers, 
                and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed 
                through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; 
                did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which, 
                along its borders, raised their picturesque outlines against the 
                sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which 
                the old historians always spoke of with horror, and upon which 
                the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the 
                gods by ample sacrifices. How did this eccentric personage pass 
                his time on the Mongolia? He made his four hearty meals every 
                day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on 
                the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for 
                he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself. 
                A tax-collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev. Decimus 
                Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general 
                of the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares, 
                made up the party, and, with Mr. Fogg, played whist by the hour 
                together in absorbing silence. </p>
              <p>　　As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped sea-sickness, and 
                took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin. He rather 
                enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took 
                a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, 
                and consoled himself with the delusion that his master's whim 
                would end at Bombay. He was pleased, on the day after leaving 
                Suez, to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked 
                and chatted on the quays. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;If I am not mistaken,&quot; said he, approaching this 
                person, with his most amiable smile, &quot;you are the gentleman 
                who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah! I quite recognise you. You are the servant of the 
                strange Englishman--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Just so, monsieur--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Fix.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Monsieur Fix,&quot; resumed Passepartout, &quot;I'm charmed 
                to find you on board. Where are you bound?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Like you, to Bombay.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That's capital! Have you made this trip before?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular 
                Company.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Then you know India?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why yes,&quot; replied Fix, who spoke cautiously. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A curious place, this India?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, 
                pagodas, tigers, snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample 
                time to see the sights.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense 
                ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway 
                train, and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending 
                to make the tour of the world in eighty days! No; all these gymnastics, 
                you may be sure, will cease at Bombay.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?&quot; asked Fix, in 
                the most natural tone in the world. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it's 
                the sea air. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But I never see your master on deck.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Never; he hasn't the least curiosity.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Do you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour 
                in eighty days may conceal some secret errand--perhaps a diplomatic 
                mission?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about 
                it, nor would I give half a crown to find out.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit 
                of chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the 
                worthy man's confidence. He frequently offered him a glass of 
                whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout 
                never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing 
                Fix the best of good fellows. </p>
              <p>　　Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 
                13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees 
                were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied 
                vast coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated 
                place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled 
                fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following 
                night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means 
                in Arabic The Bridge of Tears, and the next day they put in at 
                Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This 
                matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances 
                from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight 
                hundred thousand pounds a year. In these distant seas, coal is 
                worth three or four pounds sterling a ton. </p>
              <p>　　The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse 
                before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at 
                Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, 
                did not affect Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the Mongolia, 
                instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she 
                was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen 
                hours. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport 
                again visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them. The visa procured, 
                Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits; while 
                Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed 
                population of Somanlis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans 
                who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden. He 
                gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place 
                the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean, and the vast cisterns where 
                the English engineers were still at work, two thousand years after 
                the engineers of Solomon. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very curious, very curious,&quot; said Passepartout to 
                himself, on returning to the steamer. &quot;I see that it is by 
                no means useless to travel, if a man wants to see something new.&quot; 
                At six p.m. the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead, and 
                was soon once more on the Indian Ocean. She had a hundred and 
                sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, 
                the wind being in the north-west, and all sails aiding the engine. 
                The steamer rolled but little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared 
                on deck, and the singing and dancing were resumed. The trip was 
                being accomplished most successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted 
                with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the 
                person of the delightful Fix. On Sunday, October 20th, towards 
                noon, they came in sight of the Indian coast: two hours later 
                the pilot came on board. A range of hills lay against the sky 
                in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay 
                came distinctly into view. The steamer entered the road formed 
                by the islands in the bay, and at half-past four she hauled up 
                at the quays of Bombay. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber 
                of the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, 
                captured all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign 
                with a brilliant victory. </p>
              <p>　　The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on 
                the 20th. This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his 
                departure from London, and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary, 
                in the column of gains.</p>

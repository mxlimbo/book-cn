              <p><b>　　DURING WHICH MR. FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN 
                </b></p>
              <p>　　 What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai 
                will be easily guessed. The signals made by the Tankadere had 
                been seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, espying 
                the flag at half-mast, had directed his course towards the little 
                craft. Phileas Fogg, after paying the stipulated price of his 
                passage to John Busby, and rewarding that worthy with the additional 
                sum of five hundred and fifty pounds, ascended the steamer with 
                Aouda and Fix; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama. 
              </p>
              <p>　　They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of 
                November. Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic, 
                where he learned, to Aouda's great delight--and perhaps to his 
                own, though he betrayed no emotion--that Passepartout, a Frenchman, 
                had really arrived on her the day before. </p>
              <p>　　The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very 
                evening, and it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, 
                without delay. Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English 
                consuls, and, after wandering through the streets a long time, 
                began to despair of finding his missing servant. Chance, or perhaps 
                a kind of presentiment, at last led him into the Honourable Mr. 
                Batulcar's theatre. He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout 
                in the eccentric mountebank's costume; but the latter, lying on 
                his back, perceived his master in the gallery. He could not help 
                starting, which so changed the position of his nose as to bring 
                the &quot;pyramid&quot; pell-mell upon the stage. </p>
              <p>　　All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to 
                him what had taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai 
                on the Tankadere, in company with one Mr. Fix. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name. 
                He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his 
                master what had taken place between the detective and himself; 
                and, in the account he gave of his absence, he simply excused 
                himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium 
                at a tavern in Hong Kong. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then 
                furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more 
                in harmony with his position. Within an hour the Frenchman had 
                cut off his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing 
                about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou. </p>
              <p>　　The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San 
                Francisco belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and 
                was named the General Grant. She was a large paddle-wheel steamer 
                of two thousand five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast. 
                The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one 
                end a piston-rod worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod 
                which, in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was 
                directly connected with the shaft of the paddles. The General 
                Grant was rigged with three masts, giving a large capacity for 
                sails, and thus materially aiding the steam power. By making twelve 
                miles an hour, she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days. Phileas 
                Fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach San 
                Francisco by the 2nd of December, New York by the 11th, and London 
                on the 20th--thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 
                21st of December. </p>
              <p>　　There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them 
                English, many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way 
                to California, and several East Indian officers, who were spending 
                their vacation in making the tour of the world. Nothing of moment 
                happened on the voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, 
                rolled but little, and the Pacific almost justified its name. 
                Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever. His young companion 
                felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than 
                gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than 
                she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded 
                to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her 
                protector. Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans, and became 
                impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey. 
              </p>
              <p>　　She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive 
                the state of the lady's heart; and, being the most faithful of 
                domestics, he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's honesty, 
                generosity, and devotion. He took pains to calm Aouda's doubts 
                of a successful termination of the journey, telling her that the 
                most difficult part of it had passed, that now they were beyond 
                the fantastic countries of Japan and China, and were fairly on 
                their way to civilised places again. A railway train from San 
                Francisco to New York, and a transatlantic steamer from New York 
                to Liverpool, would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible 
                journey round the world within the period agreed upon. </p>
              <p>　　On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed 
                exactly one half of the terrestrial globe. The General Grant passed, 
                on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, 
                and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, 
                exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete 
                the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he 
                was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really 
                gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged 
                to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, 
                from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could 
                he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which 
                is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about 
                twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular 
                methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which 
                he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand 
                five hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was 
                no longer there to put obstacles in their way! </p>
              <p>　　It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout 
                made a joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate 
                fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London 
                time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through 
                as quite false and unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had 
                not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly agreed 
                with the ship's chronometers. His triumph was hilarious. He would 
                have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard! </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The rogue told me a lot of stories,&quot; repeated Passepartout, 
                &quot;about the meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! 
                moonshine more likely! If one listened to that sort of people, 
                a pretty sort of time one would keep! I was sure that the sun 
                would some day regulate itself by my watch!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had 
                been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, 
                he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch 
                would then, instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning, 
                indicate nine o'clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first 
                hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time 
                and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix 
                had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepartout 
                would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it. Moreover, 
                if the detective had been on board at that moment, Passepartout 
                would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject, 
                and in an entirely different manner. </p>
              <p>　　Where was Fix at that moment? </p>
              <p>　　He was actually on board the General Grant. </p>
              <p>　　On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom 
                he expected to meet again during the day, had repaired at once 
                to the English consulate, where he at last found the warrant of 
                arrest. It had followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, 
                on which steamer he himself was supposed to be. Fix's disappointment 
                may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless. 
                Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now necessary to 
                procure his extradition! &quot;Well,&quot; thought Fix, after 
                a moment of anger, &quot;my warrant is not good here, but it will 
                be in England. The rogue evidently intends to return to his own 
                country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track. Good! 
                I will follow him across the Atlantic. As for the money, heaven 
                grant there may be some left! But the fellow has already spent 
                in travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts 
                of charges, more than five thousand pounds. Yet, after all, the 
                Bank is rich!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, 
                and was there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived. To his utter amazement, 
                he recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise. He 
                quickly concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, 
                and hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived 
                by Mr. Fogg's servant. </p>
              <p>　　On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face 
                on the forward deck. The latter, without a word, made a rush for 
                him, grasped him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of 
                a group of Americans, who immediately began to bet on him, administered 
                to the detective a perfect volley of blows, which proved the great 
                superiority of French over English pugilistic skill. </p>
              <p>　　When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and 
                comforted. Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking 
                at his adversary, coldly said, &quot;Have you done?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;For this time--yes.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Then let me have a word with you.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But I--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;In your master's interests.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for 
                he quietly followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest 
                of the passengers. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You have given me a thrashing,&quot; said Fix. &quot;Good, 
                I expected it. Now, listen to me. Up to this time I have been 
                Mr. Fogg's adversary. I am now in his game.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Aha!&quot; cried Passepartout; &quot;you are convinced 
                he is an honest man?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Fix coldly, &quot;I think him a rascal. 
                Sh! don't budge, and let me speak. As long as Mr. Fogg was on 
                English ground, it was for my interest to detain him there until 
                my warrant of arrest arrived. I did everything I could to keep 
                him back. I sent the Bombay priests after him, I got you intoxicated 
                at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and I made him miss the 
                Yokohama steamer.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout listened, with closed fists. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Now,&quot; resumed Fix, &quot;Mr. Fogg seems to be going 
                back to England. Well, I will follow him there. But hereafter 
                I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done 
                up to this time to put them in his path. I've changed my game, 
                you see, and simply because it was for my interest to change it. 
                Your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in England that 
                you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal 
                or an honest man.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced 
                that he spoke with entire good faith. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Are we friends?&quot; asked the detective. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Friends?--no,&quot; replied Passepartout; &quot;but allies, 
                perhaps. At the least sign of treason, however, I'll twist your 
                neck for you.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Agreed,&quot; said the detective quietly. </p>
              <p>　　Eleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the General Grant 
                entered the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day.</p>

              <p><b>　　 IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS, UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED 
                MEN, APPEARS ON 'CHANGE </b></p>
              <p>　　 Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London 
                would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the 
                bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic 
                of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into 
                the papers throughout England. The boasted &quot;tour of the world&quot; 
                was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the 
                subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas 
                Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against 
                him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of 
                the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in 
                this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. 
                The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty 
                other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project 
                as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. 
                People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform 
                Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental 
                aberration of its proposer. </p>
              <p>　　Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, 
                for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the 
                columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured 
                by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally 
                of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more 
                popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, 
                copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of 
                the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, &quot;Why not, after all? 
                Stranger things have come to pass.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in 
                the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated 
                the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter 
                folly of the enterprise. </p>
              <p>　　Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle 
                imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of 
                the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was 
                absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon 
                on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where 
                the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated 
                upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, 
                could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task? There 
                were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off 
                the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by snow--were 
                not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he not find himself, 
                when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of the winds 
                and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two 
                or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to 
                fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg 
                once miss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for 
                the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain. 
              </p>
              <p>　　This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied 
                into all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the 
                rash tourist. </p>
              <p>　　Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who 
                are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English 
                temperament. Not only the members of the Reform, but the general 
                public, made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was 
                set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse. Bonds 
                were issued, and made their appearance on 'Change; &quot;Phileas 
                Fogg bonds&quot; were offered at par or at a premium, and a great 
                business was done in them. But five days after the article in 
                the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the demand 
                began to subside: &quot;Phileas Fogg&quot; declined. They were 
                offered by packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last 
                nobody would take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred! </p>
              <p>　　Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the 
                only advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was fastened 
                to his chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make 
                the tour of the world, if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand 
                pounds on Phileas Fogg. When the folly as well as the uselessness 
                of the adventure was pointed out to him, he contented himself 
                with replying, &quot;If the thing is feasible, the first to do 
                it ought to be an Englishman.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going 
                against him, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred 
                to one; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which 
                deprived him of backers at any price. </p>
              <p>　　The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine 
                o'clock one evening, when the following telegraphic dispatch was 
                put into his hands: </p>
              <p>　　Suez to London. </p>
              <p>　　Rowan, Commissioner of Police, Scotland Yard: </p>
              <p>　　I've found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg. Send with out delay 
                warrant of arrest to Bombay. </p>
              <p>　　Fix, Detective. </p>
              <p>　　The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous. The polished 
                gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber. His photograph, 
                which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform 
                Club, was minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, 
                the description of the robber which had been provided to the police. 
                The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary 
                ways, his sudden departure; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking 
                a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no 
                other end in view than to elude the detectives, and throw them 
                off his track. </p>

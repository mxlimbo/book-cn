              <p><b>　　IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT 
                IS SAID TO HIM </b></p>
              <p>　　 The Rangoon--one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's 
                boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas--was a screw steamer, 
                built of iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, 
                and with engines of four hundred horse-power. She was as fast, 
                but not as well fitted up, as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not 
                as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could 
                have wished. However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only 
                comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from 
                ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please. 
              </p>
              <p>　　During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted 
                with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude 
                for what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her, 
                apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his 
                manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always 
                on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort. 
                He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much 
                to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk. He treated her with 
                the strictest politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, 
                the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose. Aouda 
                did not quite know what to make of him, though Passepartout had 
                given her some hints of his master's eccentricity, and made her 
                smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round 
                the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she 
                always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching 
                history. She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native 
                races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes 
                there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, 
                was made a baronet by the English government. Aouda was a relative 
                of this great man, and it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped 
                to join at Hong Kong. Whether she would find a protector in him 
                she could not tell; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, 
                and to assure her that everything would be mathematically--he 
                used the very word--arranged. Aouda fastened her great eyes, &quot;clear 
                as thee sacred lakes of the Himalaya,&quot; upon him; but the 
                intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined 
                to throw himself into this lake. </p>
              <p>　　The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid 
                favourable weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in 
                sight of the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the 
                Bay of Bengal, with its picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand 
                four hundred feet high, looming above the waters. The steamer 
                passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are 
                in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, 
                cannibals, did not make their appearance. </p>
              <p>　　The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. 
                Vast forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic 
                mimosa, and tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, 
                the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the 
                sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows 
                whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial 
                Empire. The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was 
                soon passed, however, and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits 
                of Malacca, which gave access to the China seas. </p>
              <p>　　What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country 
                to country, doing all this while? He had managed to embark on 
                the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after 
                leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be 
                forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence 
                to the end of the voyage. It would have been difficult to explain 
                why he was on board without awakening Passepartout's suspicions, 
                who thought him still at Bombay. But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, 
                to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant, as will be 
                seen. </p>
              <p>　　All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong 
                Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to 
                enable him to take any steps there. The arrest must be made at 
                Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him for ever. Hong 
                Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, 
                China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. 
                If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, 
                Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local 
                police, and there would be no further trouble. But beyond Hong 
                Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant 
                would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, 
                of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice. </p>
              <p>　　Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours 
                which he spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, &quot;Now, 
                either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall 
                arrest my man, or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely 
                necessary that I should delay his departure. I have failed at 
                Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, 
                my reputation is lost: Cost what it may, I must succeed! But how 
                shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my 
                last resource?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would 
                make a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a 
                fellow his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg's 
                accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his 
                disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime, 
                would doubtless become an ally of the detective. But this method 
                was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else 
                had failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin 
                all. The detective was therefore in a sore strait. But suddenly 
                a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon, in 
                company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her 
                Fogg's travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere 
                between Bombay and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, 
                or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this 
                charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether 
                there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed 
                itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed 
                intrigue. Whether the young woman were married or not, he would 
                be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong 
                that he could not escape by paying any amount of money. </p>
              <p>　　But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had 
                an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before 
                anything could be effected, might get full under way again for 
                Yokohama. </p>
              <p>　　Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and 
                signal the Rangoon before her arrival. This was easy to do, since 
                the steamer stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic 
                wire to Hong Kong. He finally resolved, moreover, before acting 
                more positively, to question Passepartout. It would not be difficult 
                to make him talk; and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared 
                to make himself known. </p>
              <p>　　It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the 
                Rangoon was due at Singapore. </p>
              <p>　　Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was 
                promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The 
                detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, 
                and exclaimed, &quot;You here, on the Rangoon?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?&quot; returned 
                the really astonished Passepartout, recognising his crony of the 
                Mongolia. &quot;Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on 
                the way to Hong Kong! Are you going round the world too?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, no,&quot; replied Fix; &quot;I shall stop at Hong 
                Kong--at least for some days.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Hum!&quot; said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant 
                perplexed. &quot;But how is it I have not seen you on board since 
                we left Calcutta?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness--I've been staying in my 
                berth. The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the 
                Indian Ocean. And how is Mr. Fogg?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! 
                But, Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with 
                us.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A young lady?&quot; replied the detective, not seeming 
                to comprehend what was said. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair 
                at the Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand 
                pounds, the rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, 
                and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. 
                Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally 
                ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed 
                to find so interested a listener. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But does your master propose to carry this young woman 
                to Europe?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the 
                protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Nothing to be done there,&quot; said Fix to himself, 
                concealing his disappointment. &quot;A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly 
                glass on board the Rangoon.&quot;</p>

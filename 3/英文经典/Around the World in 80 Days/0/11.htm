              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SECURES A CURIOUS MEANS OF CONVEYANCE 
                AT A FABULOUS PRICE </b></p>
              <p>　　 The train had started punctually. Among the passengers were 
                a number of officers, Government officials, and opium and indigo 
                merchants, whose business called them to the eastern coast. Passepartout 
                rode in the same carriage with his master, and a third passenger 
                occupied a seat opposite to them. This was Sir Francis Cromarty, 
                one of Mr. Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way 
                to join his corps at Benares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair man 
                of fifty, who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy 
                revolt. He made India his home, only paying brief visits to England 
                at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with 
                the customs, history, and character of India and its people. But 
                Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but only describing a circumference, 
                took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body, 
                traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to 
                the laws of rational mechanics. He was at this moment calculating 
                in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from 
                London, and, had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration, 
                would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction. Sir Francis Cromarty 
                had observed the oddity of his travelling companion--although 
                the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he 
                was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers--and questioned 
                himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior, 
                and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature. 
                The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all 
                the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to 
                this product of the exact sciences. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design 
                of going round the world, nor the circumstances under which he 
                set out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity 
                and a lack of sound common sense. In the way this strange gentleman 
                was going on, he would leave the world without having done any 
                good to himself or anybody else. </p>
              <p>　　An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts 
                and the Island of Salcette, and had got into the open country. 
                At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which 
                descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; 
                and, passing Pauwell, they entered the defiles of the mountains, 
                with their basalt bases, and their summits crowned with thick 
                and verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged 
                a few words from time to time, and now Sir Francis, reviving the 
                conversation, observed, &quot;Some years ago, Mr. Fogg, you would 
                have met with a delay at this point which would probably have 
                lost you your wager.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;How so, Sir Francis?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, 
                which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on 
                ponies to Kandallah, on the other side.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the 
                least,&quot; said Mr. Fogg. &quot;I have constantly foreseen the 
                likelihood of certain obstacles.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But, Mr. Fogg,&quot; pursued Sir Francis, &quot;you run 
                the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow's 
                adventure at the pagoda.&quot; Passepartout, his feet comfortably 
                wrapped in his travelling-blanket, was sound asleep and did not 
                dream that anybody was talking about him. &quot;The Government 
                is very severe upon that kind of offence. It takes particular 
                care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected, 
                and if your servant were caught--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very well, Sir Francis,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg; &quot;if 
                he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished, 
                and then would have quietly returned to Europe. I don't see how 
                this affair could have delayed his master.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The conversation fell again. During the night the train left 
                the mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded 
                over the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with 
                its straggling villages, above which rose the minarets of the 
                pagodas. This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers 
                and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise 
                that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, 
                guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw 
                out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, 
                while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, 
                in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis 
                (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched 
                by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then 
                they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles 
                inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the 
                train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still 
                haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train 
                as it passed. The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal 
                country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess 
                Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and 
                the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now 
                the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom 
                of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, 
                king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united 
                by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of 
                the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period 
                when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over 
                without corpses being found in every direction. The English Government 
                has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the 
                Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible 
                rites. </p>
              <p>　　At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout 
                was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false 
                pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase 
                his feet. The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off 
                for Assurghur, after skirting for a little the banks of the small 
                river Tapty, which empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to 
                his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey 
                would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across 
                India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit 
                of his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic 
                ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He came to 
                regard his master's project as intended in good earnest, believed 
                in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world 
                and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated 
                period. Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents 
                which might happen on the way. He recognised himself as being 
                personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought 
                that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable 
                folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. 
                Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days 
                passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and 
                accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for 
                not having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant 
                that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of 
                a steamer, it could not be done on the railway. </p>
              <p>　　The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which 
                separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next 
                day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; 
                to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three 
                in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the 
                Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, 
                was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout's 
                time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done 
                to Fix; and up on the general insisting that the watch should 
                be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going 
                eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days 
                were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout 
                obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London 
                time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one. </p>
              <p>　　The train stopped, at eight o'clock, in the midst of a glade 
                some fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, 
                and workmen's cabins. The conductor, passing along the carriages, 
                shouted, &quot;Passengers will get out here!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; 
                but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst 
                of this forest of dates and acacias. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned, 
                crying: &quot;Monsieur, no more railway!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Sir Francis. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I mean to say that the train isn't going on.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly 
                followed him, and they proceeded together to the conductor. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Where are we?&quot; asked Sir Francis. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At the hamlet of Kholby.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Do we stop here?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Certainly. The railway isn't finished.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What! not finished?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No. There's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid 
                from here to Allahabad, where the line begins again.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,&quot; retorted 
                Sir Francis, who was growing warm. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No doubt,&quot; replied the conductor; &quot;but the 
                passengers know that they must provide means of transportation 
                for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have 
                knocked the conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sir Francis,&quot; said Mr. Fogg quietly, &quot;we will, 
                if you please, look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What! You knew that the way--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would 
                sooner or later arise on my route. Nothing, therefore, is lost. 
                I have two days, which I have already gained, to sacrifice. A 
                steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th. This 
                is the 22nd, and we shall reach Calcutta in time.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　There was nothing to say to so confident a response. </p>
              <p>　　It was but too true that the railway came to a termination 
                at this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a 
                way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement 
                of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers 
                were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they 
                began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled 
                palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like 
                perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village 
                from end to end, came back without having found anything. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I shall go afoot,&quot; said Phileas Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, 
                as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. 
                Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment's 
                hesitation, said, &quot;Monsieur, I think I have found a means 
                of conveyance.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who 
                lives but a hundred steps from here.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Let's go and see the elephant,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. 
              </p>
              <p>　　They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within 
                some high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came 
                out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the 
                enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a 
                beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. 
                The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding 
                him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a 
                ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by 
                those who train the Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, 
                for Mr. Fogg, the animal's instruction in this direction had not 
                gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness. 
                Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could doubtless travel 
                rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of 
                conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far 
                from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, 
                which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially 
                as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed 
                to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg 
                persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for 
                the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused 
                also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each 
                advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer 
                was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen 
                hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than 
                six hundred pounds sterling. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed 
                to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand 
                pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make 
                a great bargain, still refused. </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to 
                reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied 
                that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty 
                thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely 
                necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay 
                twenty times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, 
                sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it 
                was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. 
                Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen 
                hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, 
                was fairly white with suspense. </p>
              <p>　　At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What a price, good heavens!&quot; cried Passepartout, 
                &quot;for an elephant. </p>
              <p>　　It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively 
                easy. A young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, 
                which Mr. Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to 
                materially stimulate his zeal. The elephant was led out and equipped. 
                The Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his 
                back with a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his 
                flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs. Phileas Fogg paid 
                the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous 
                carpet-bag, a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout 
                of his vitals. Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad, 
                which the brigadier gratefully accepted, as one traveller the 
                more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast. Provisions 
                were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg 
                took the howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the 
                saddle-cloth between them. The Parsee perched himself on the elephant's 
                neck, and at nine o'clock they set out from the village, the animal 
                marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest 
                cut. </p>

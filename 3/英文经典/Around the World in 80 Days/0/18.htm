              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG, PASSEPARTOUT, AND FIX GO EACH ABOUT 
                HIS BUSINESS </b></p>
              <p>　　 The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. 
                The wind, obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, 
                and retarded the steamer. The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers 
                became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised 
                before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, 
                the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves 
                running high. The Rangoon reefed all her sails, and even the rigging 
                proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer 
                was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she 
                would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the 
                storm lasted. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to 
                be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. 
                He never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of 
                twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would 
                almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But this man of 
                nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as 
                if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. 
                Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first 
                time she saw him. </p>
              <p>　　Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. 
                The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been 
                complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence 
                of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became 
                more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some 
                days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, 
                with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him 
                sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst 
                his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded 
                with hopeful exultation. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious 
                weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had 
                seemed to be at his master's service; steamers and railways obeyed 
                him; wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the hour 
                of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if the 
                twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The storm 
                exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash 
                the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed 
                from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout 
                could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted, 
                being unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head 
                to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew. 
                He overwhelmed the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not 
                help laughing at his impatience, with all sorts of questions. 
                He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last; 
                whereupon he was referred to the barometer, which seemed to have 
                no intention of rising. Passepartout shook it, but with no perceptible 
                effect; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon 
                it to change its mind. </p>
              <p>　　On the 4th, however, the sea became more calm, and the storm 
                lessened its violence; the wind veered southward, and was once 
                more favourable. Passepartout cleared up with the weather. Some 
                of the sails were unfurled, and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid 
                speed. The time lost could not, however, be regained. Land was 
                not signalled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th; the 
                steamer was due on the 5th. Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours 
                behind-hand, and the Yokohama steamer would, of course, be missed. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge, 
                to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong 
                Kong. Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for 
                Yokohama; but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark 
                of hope, which still remained till the last moment. He had confided 
                his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal!--tried to console him 
                by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat; 
                but this only put Passepartout in a passion. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, bolder than his servant, did not hesitate to approach 
                the pilot, and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would 
                leave Hong Kong for Yokohama. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At high tide to-morrow morning,&quot; answered the pilot. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mr. Fogg, without betraying any astonishment. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, who heard what passed, would willingly have embraced 
                the pilot, while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is the steamer's name?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg. &quot;The 
                Carnatic.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ought she not to have gone yesterday?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers, 
                and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Thank you,&quot; returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically 
                to the saloon. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily 
                in his delight, exclaiming, &quot;Pilot, you are the best of good 
                fellows!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses 
                won him this enthusiastic greeting. He remounted the bridge, and 
                guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks, tankas, and 
                fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong. </p>
              <p>　　At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay, and the passengers 
                were going ashore. </p>
              <p>　　Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg, for had not the 
                Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers, she 
                would have left on the 6th of November, and the passengers for 
                Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing 
                of the next steamer. Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours 
                behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder 
                of his tour. </p>
              <p>　　The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San 
                Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and 
                it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. 
                Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time 
                would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two 
                days across the Pacific. He found himself, then, about twenty-four 
                hours behind-hand, thirty-five days after leaving London. </p>
              <p>　　The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next 
                morning. Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his 
                business there, which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy 
                relative. </p>
              <p>　　On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they 
                repaired to the Club Hotel. A room was engaged for the young woman, 
                and Mr. Fogg, after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out 
                in search of her cousin Jeejeeh. He instructed Passepartout to 
                remain at the hotel until his return, that Aouda might not be 
                left entirely alone. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt, 
                every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as 
                the Parsee merchant. Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to 
                learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before, and, retiring 
                from business with an immense fortune, had taken up his residence 
                in Europe--in Holland the broker thought, with the merchants of 
                which country he had principally traded. Phileas Fogg returned 
                to the hotel, begged a moment's conversation with Aouda, and without 
                more ado, apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, 
                but probably in Holland. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda at first said nothing. She passed her hand across her 
                forehead, and reflected a few moments. Then, in her sweet, soft 
                voice, she said: &quot;What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is very simple,&quot; responded the gentleman. &quot;Go 
                on to Europe.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But I cannot intrude--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass 
                my project. Passepartout!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Monsieur.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Go to the Carnatic, and engage three cabins.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very 
                gracious to him, was going to continue the journey with them, 
                went off at a brisk gait to obey his master's order.</p>

          <tr> 
            <td> 
              <p>　　YOU'VE BEEN ON DECK, Mr. Van Weyden,' Wolf Larsen said the 
                following morning at the breakfast-table. 'How do things look?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Clear enough,' I answered, glancing at the sunshine which 
                streamed down the open companionway. 'Fair westerly breeze, with 
                a promise of stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.' </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head in a pleased way. 'Any signs of fog?' </p>
              <p>　　'Thick banks in the north and northwest.' </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head again, evincing even greater satisfaction 
                than before. </p>
              <p>　　'What of the Macedonia?' </p>
              <p>　　'Not sighted,' I answered. </p>
              <p>　　I could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence, but why 
                he should be disappointed I could not conceive. </p>
              <p>　　I was soon to learn. 'Smoke ho!' came the hail from on deck, 
                and his face brightened. </p>
              <p>　　'Good!' he exclaimed, and left the table at once to go on deck 
                and into the steerage, where the hunters were taking the first 
                breakfast of their exile. </p>
              <p>　　Maud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us, gazing, 
                instead, in silent anxiety at each other and listening to Wolf 
                Larsen's voice, which easily penetrated the cabin through the 
                intervening bulkhead. He spoke at length, and his conclusion was 
                greeted with a wild roar of cheers. The bulkhead was too thick 
                for us to hear what he said; but, whatever it was, it had affected 
                the hunters strongly, for the cheering was followed by loud exclamations 
                and shouts of joy. </p>
              <p>　　From the sounds on deck I knew that the sailors had been routed 
                out and were preparing to lower the boats. Maud Brewster accompanied 
                me on deck, but I left her at the break of the poop, where she 
                might watch the scene and not be in it. The sailors must have 
                learned whatever project was on hand, and the vim and snap they 
                put into their work attested their enthusiasm. The hunters came 
                trooping on deck with shotguns and ammunition-boxes, and, most 
                unusual, their rifles. The latter were rarely taken in the boats, 
                for a seal shot at long range with a rifle invariably sank before 
                a boat could reach it. But each hunter this day had his rifle 
                and a large supply of cartridges. I noticed they grinned with 
                satisfaction whenever they looked at the Macedonia's smoke, which 
                was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The five boats went over the side with a rush, spread out like 
                the ribs of a fan, and set a northerly course, as on the preceding 
                afternoon, for us to follow. I watched for some time, curiously, 
                but there seemed nothing extraordinary about their behavior. They 
                lowered sails, shot seals, and hoisted sails again and continued 
                on their way, as I had always seen them do. The Macedonia repeated 
                her performance of yesterday, 'hogging' the sea by dropping her 
                line of boats in advance of ours and across our course. Fourteen 
                boats require a considerable spread of ocean for comfortable hunting, 
                and when she had completely lapped our line she continued steaming 
                into the northeast, dropping more boats as she went. </p>
              <p>　　'What's up?' I asked Wolf Larsen, unable longer to keep my 
                curiosity in check. </p>
              <p>　　'Never mind what's up,' he answered gruffly. 'You won't be 
                a thousand years in finding out, and in the meantime just pray 
                for plenty of wind. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, well, I don't mind telling you,' he said the next moment. 
                'I'm going to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine. 
                In short, I'm going to play the hog myself, and not for one day, 
                but for the rest of the season- if we're in luck.' </p>
              <p>　　'And if we're not?' I queried. </p>
              <p>　　'Not to be considered,' he laughed. 'We simply must be in luck, 
                or it's all up with us.' </p>
              <p>　　He had the wheel at the time, and I went forward to my hospital 
                in the forecastle, where lay the two cripped men, Nilson and Thomas 
                Mugridge. Nilson was as cheerful as could be expected, for his 
                broken leg was knitting nicely; but the Cockney was desperately 
                melancholy, and I was aware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate 
                creature. And the marvel of it was that still he lived and clung 
                to life. The brutal years had reduced his meager body to splintered 
                wreckage, and yet the spark of light within burned as brightly 
                as ever. </p>
              <p>　　'With an artificial foot,- and they make excellent ones,- you 
                will be stumping ships' galleys to the end of time,' I assured 
                him, jovially. </p>
              <p>　　But his answer was serious, nay, solemn. </p>
              <p>　　'I don't know about wot you s'y, Mr. Van W'yden, but I do know 
                I'll never rest 'appy till I see that 'ell-'ound dead. 'E cawn't 
                live as long as me. 'E's got no right to live, an', as the Good 
                Word puts it, &quot;'E shall shorely die,&quot; an' I s'y, &quot;Amen, 
                an' d- soon at that.&quot;' </p>
              <p>　　When I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly 
                with one hand, while with the other hand he held the marine glasses 
                and studied the situation of the boats, paying particular attention 
                to the position of the Macedonia. The only change noticeable in 
                our boats was that they had hauled close on the wind and were 
                heading several points west of north. Still, I could not see the 
                expediency of the maneuver, for the free sea was intercepted by 
                the Macedonia's five weather boats, which, in turn, had hauled 
                close on the wind. Thus they slowly diverged toward the west, 
                drawing farther and farther away from the remainder of the boats 
                in their line. </p>
              <p>　　Our boats were rowing as well as sailing. Even the hunters 
                were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly 
                overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy. </p>
              <p>　　The smoke of the Macedonia had dwindled to a dim blot on the 
                northeastern horizon. Of the steamer herself nothing was to be 
                seen. We had been loafing along till now, our sails shaking half 
                the time and spilling the wind; and twice, for short periods, 
                we had been hove to. But there was no more loafing. Sheets were 
                trimmed, and Wolf Larsen proceeded to put the Ghost through her 
                paces. We ran past our line of boats and bore down upon the first 
                weather boat of the other line. </p>
              <p>　　'Down that flying jib, Mr. Van Weyden,' Wolf Larsen commanded. 
                'And stand by to back over the jibs.' </p>
              <p>　　I ran forward, and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in 
                and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward. 
                The three men in it gazed at us suspiciously. They had been hogging 
                the sea, and they knew Wolf Larsen by reputation at any rate. 
                I noted that the hunter, a huge Scandinavian sitting in the bow, 
                held his rifle, ready to hand, across his knees. It should have 
                been in its proper place in the rack. When they came opposite 
                our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand, and 
                cried: </p>
              <p>　　'Come on aboard and have a &quot;gam&quot;?' </p>
              <p>　　'To gam,' among the sealing-schooners, is a substitute for 
                the verbs 'to visit,' 'to gossip.' It expresses the garrulity 
                of the sea, and is a pleasant break in the monotony of the life. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The Ghost swung around into the wind, and I finished my work 
                forward in time to run aft and lend a hand with the main-sheet. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'You will please stay on deck, Miss Brewster,' Wolf Larsen 
                said, as he started forward to meet his guest. 'And you, too, 
                Mr. Van Weyden.' </p>
              <p>　　The boat had lowered its sail and run alongside. The hunter, 
                golden-bearded like a sea-king, came over the rail and dropped 
                on deck. But his hugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness. 
                Doubt and distrust showed strongly in his face. It was a transparent 
                face, for all of its hairy shield, and advertised instant relief 
                when he glanced from Wolf Larsen to me, noted that there was only 
                the pair of us, and then glanced over his own two men, who had 
                joined him. Surely he had little reason to be afraid. He towered 
                like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen. He must have measured six feet 
                eight or nine inches in stature, and I subsequently learned his 
                weight- two hundred and forty pounds. And there was no fat about 
                him; it was all bone and muscle. </p>
              <p>　　A return of apprehension was apparent, when, at the top of 
                the companionway. Wolf Larsen invited him below. But he reassured 
                himself with a glance down at his host, a big man himself, but 
                dwarfed by the propinquity of the giant. So all hesitancy vanished, 
                and the pair descended into the cabin. In the meantime his two 
                men, as was the wont of visiting sailors, had gone forward into 
                the forecastle to do some visiting themselves. </p>
              <p>　　Suddenly from the cabin came a great choking bellow, followed 
                by all the sounds of a furious struggle. It was the leopard and 
                the lion, and the lion made all the noise. Wolf Larsen was the 
                leopard. </p>
              <p>　　'You see the sacredness of our hospitality,' I said bitterly 
                to Maud Brewster. </p>
              <p>　　She nodded her head that she heard, and I noted in her face 
                the signs of the same sickness at sight or sound of violent struggle 
                from which I had suffered so severely during my first weeks on 
                the Ghost. </p>
              <p>　　'Wouldn't it be better if you went forward, say by the steerage 
                companionway, until it is over?' I suggested. </p>
              <p>　　She shook her head and gazed at me pitifully. She was not frightened, 
                but appalled, rather, at the human animality of it. </p>
              <p>　　'You will understand,' I took advantage of the opportunity 
                to say, 'whatever part I take in what is going on and what is 
                to come, that I am compelled to take it- if you and I are ever 
                to get out of this scrape with our lives. It is not nice- for 
                me,' I added. </p>
              <p>　　'I understand,' she said in a weak, far-away voice, and her 
                eyes showed me that she did understand. </p>
              <p>　　The sounds from below soon died away. Then Wolf Larsen came 
                alone on deck. There was slight flush under his bronze, but otherwise 
                he bore no signs of the battle. </p>
              <p>　　'Send those two men aft, Mr. Van Weyden,' he said. </p>
              <p>　　I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Hoist in your boat,' he said to them. 'Your hunter's decided 
                to stay aboard awhile and doesn't want it pounding alongside.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Hoist in your boat, I said,' he repeated, this time in sharper 
                tones, as they hesitated to do his bidding. </p>
              <p>　　'Who knows, you may have to sail with me for a time,' he said 
                quite softly, with a silken threat that belied the softness, as 
                they moved slowly to comply, 'and we might as well start with 
                a friendly understanding. Lively now! Death Larsen makes you jump 
                better than that, and you know it.' </p>
              <p>　　Their movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching, and 
                as the boat swung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs. 
                Wolf Larsen, at the wheel, directed the Ghost after the Macedonia's 
                second weather boat. </p>
              <p>　　Under way, and with nothing for the time being to do, I turned 
                my attention to the situation of the boats. The Macedonia's third 
                weather boat was being attacked by two. of ours, the fourth by 
                our remaining three; and the fifth, turn about, was taking a hand 
                in the defense of its nearest mate. The fight had opened at long 
                distance, and the rifles were cracking steadily. A quick, snappy 
                sea was being kicked up by the wind, a condition which prevented 
                fine shooting; and now and again, as we drew closer, we could 
                see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave. </p>
              <p>　　The boat we were pursuing had squared away and was running 
                before the wind to escape us, and, in the course of its flight, 
                to take part in repulsing our general boat attack. </p>
              <p>　　Attending to sheets and tacks now left me little time to see 
                what was taking place, but I happened to be on the poop when Wolf 
                Larsen ordered the two strange sailors forward and into the forecastle, 
                They went sullenly, but they went. He next ordered Miss Brewster 
                below, and smiled at the instant horror that leapt into her eyes. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'You'll find nothing gruesome down there,' he said. 'Only an 
                unhurt man securely made fast to the ring-bolts. Bullets are liable 
                to come aboard, and I don't want you killed, you know.' </p>
              <p>　　Even as he spoke, a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped 
                spoke of the wheel between his hands and screeched off through 
                the air to windward. </p>
              <p>　　'You see,' he said to her; and then to me, 'Mr. Van Weyden, 
                will you take the wheel?' </p>
              <p>　　Maud Brewster had stepped inside the companionway, so that 
                only her head was exposed. Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and 
                was throwing a cartridge into the barrel. I begged her with my 
                eyes to go below, but she smiled and said: </p>
              <p>　　'We may be feeble land-creatures without legs, but we can show 
                Captain Larsen that we are at least as brave as he.' </p>
              <p>　　He gave her a quick look of admiration. </p>
              <p>　　'I like you a hundred percent better for that,' he said. 'Books, 
                and brains, and bravery. You are well rounded- a blue-stocking 
                fit to be the wife of a pirate chief. Ahem! we'll discuss that 
                later,' he smiled, as a bullet struck solidly into the cabin wall. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke, and I saw the terror 
                mount in her own. </p>
              <p>　　'We are braver,' I hastened to say. 'At least, speaking for 
                myself, I know I am braver than Captain Larsen.' </p>
              <p>　　It was I who was now favored by a quick look. He was wondering 
                if I was making fun of him. I put three or four spokes over to 
                counteract a sheer toward the wind on the part of the Ghost, and 
                then steadied her. Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation, 
                and I pointed down to my knees. </p>
              <p>　　'You will observe there,' I said, slight trembling. It is because 
                I am afraid, the flesh is afraid; and I am afraid in my mind because 
                I do not wish to die. But my spirit masters the trembling flesh 
                and the qualms of the mind. I am more than brave: I am courageous. 
                Your flesh is not afraid. You are not afraid. On the one hand, 
                it costs you nothing to encounter danger; on the other, it even 
                gives you delight. You enjoy it. You may be unafraid, Mr. Larsen, 
                but you must grant that the bravery is mine.' </p>
              <p>　　'You're right,' he acknowledged at once. 'I never thought of 
                it in that way before. But is the opposite true? If you are braver 
                than I, am I more cowardly than you?' </p>
              <p>　　We both laughed at the absurdity, and he dropped down to the 
                deck and rested his rifle across the rail. The bullets we had 
                received had traveled nearly a mile, but by now we had cut that 
                distance in half. He fired three careful shots. The first struck 
                fifty feet to windward of the boat, the second alongside; and 
                at the third the boat-steerer let loose his steering-oar and crumpled 
                up in the bottom of the boat. </p>
              <p>　　'I guess that'll fix them,' Wolf Larsen said, rising to his 
                feet. 'I couldn't afford to let the hunter have it, and there 
                is a chance the boat-puller doesn't know how to steer. In which 
                case, the hunter cannot steer and shoot at the same time.' </p>
              <p>　　His reasoning was justified, for the boat rushed at once into 
                the wind, and the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer's 
                place. There was no more shooting, though the rifles were still 
                cracking merrily from the other boats. </p>
              <p>　　The hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again, 
                but we ran down upon it, going at least two feet to its one. A 
                hundred yards away I saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter. 
                Wolf Larsen went amidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards 
                from its pin. Then he peered over the rail with leveled rifle. 
                Twice I saw the hunter let go the steering-oar with one hand, 
                reach for his rifle, and hesitate. We were now alongside and foaming 
                past. </p>
              <p>　　'Here, you!' Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller. 
                'Take a turn!' </p>
              <p>　　At the same time he flung the coil of rope. It struck fairly, 
                nearly knocking the man over, but he did not obey. Instead, he 
                looked to his hunter for orders. The hunter, in turn, was in a 
                quandary. His rifle was between his knees, but if he let go the 
                steering-oar in order to shoot, the boat would sweep around and 
                collide with the schooner. Also, he saw Wolf Larsen's rifle bearing 
                upon him and knew he would be shot before he could get his rifle 
                into play. </p>
              <p>　　'Take a turn,' he said quietly to the man. </p>
              <p>　　The boat-puller obeyed, taking a turn around the little forward 
                thwart and paying out the line as it jerked taut. The boat sheered 
                out with a rush, and the hunter steadied it to a parallel course 
                some twenty feet from the side of the Ghost. </p>
              <p>　　'Now get that sail down and come alongside!' Wolf Larsen ordered. 
              </p>
              <p>　　He never let go his rifle, even passing down the tackles with 
                one hand. When they were fast, bow and stern, and the two uninjured 
                men prepared to come aboard, the hunter picked up his rifle as 
                if to place it in a secure position. </p>
              <p>　　'Drop it!' Wolf Larsen cried, and the hunter dropped it as 
                though it were hot and had burned him. </p>
              <p>　　Once aboard, the two prisoners hoisted in the boat, and under 
                Wolf Larsen's direction carried the wounded boat-steerer down 
                into the forecastle. </p>
              <p>　　'If our five boats do as well as you and I have done, we'll 
                have a pretty full crew,' Wolf Larsen said to me. </p>
              <p>　　'The man you shot- he is- I hope?' Maud Brewster quavered. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'In the shoulder,' he answered. 'Nothing serious. Mr. Van Weyden 
                will pull him around as good as ever in three or four weeks'. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But he won't pull those chaps around, from the look of it,' 
                he added, pointing at the Macedonia's third boat, for which I 
                had been steering and which was now nearly abreast of us. 'That's 
                Horner's and Smoke's work. I told them we wanted live men, not 
                carcasses. But the joy of shooting to hit is a most compelling 
                thing, when once you've learned how to shoot. Have you ever experienced 
                it, Mr. Van Weyden?' </p>
              <p>　　I shook my head and regarded their work. It had indeed been 
                bloody, for they had drawn off and joined our other three boats 
                in the attack on the remaining two of the enemy. The deserted 
                boat was in the trough of the sea, rolling drunkenly across each 
                comber, its loose spritsail out at right angles to it and fluttering 
                and flapping in the wind. The hunter and boat-puller were both 
                lying awkwardly in the bottom, but the boat-steerer lay across 
                the gunwale, half in and half out, his arms trailing in the water 
                and his head rolling from side to side. </p>
              <p>　　'Don't look, Miss Brewster, please don't look!' I had begged 
                of her, and I was glad that she had minded me and been spared 
                the sight. </p>
              <p>　　'Head right into the bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,' was Wolf Larsen's 
                command. </p>
              <p>　　As we drew nearer, the firing ceased, and we saw that the fight 
                was over. The remaining two boats had been captured by our five, 
                and the seven were grouped together, waiting to be picked up. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Look at that!' I cried involuntarily, pointing to the northeast. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The blot of smoke which indicated the Macedonia's position 
                had reappeared. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, I've been watching it,' was Wolf Larsen's calm reply. 
                He measured the distance away to the fog-bank, and for an instant 
                paused to feel the weight of the wind on his cheek. 'We'll make 
                it, I think; but you can depend upon it that blessed brother of 
                mine has twigged our little game and is just a-humping for us. 
                Ah, look at that!' </p>
              <p>　　The blot of smoke had suddenly grown larger, and it was very 
                black. </p>
              <p>　　'I'll beat you out, though, brother mine,' he chuckled. 'I'll 
                beat you out, and I hope you no worse than that you rack your 
                old engines into scrap.' </p>
              <p>　　When we hove to, a hasty though orderly confusion reigned. 
                The boats came aboard from every side at once. As fast as the 
                prisoners came over the rail they were marshaled forward into 
                the forecastle by our hunters, while our sailors hoisted in the 
                boats, dropping them anywhere upon the deck and not stopping to 
                lash them. We were already under way, all sails set and drawing, 
                and the sheets being slacked off for a wind abeam, as the last 
                boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the tackles. </p>

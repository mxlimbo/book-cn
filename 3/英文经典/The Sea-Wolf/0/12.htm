            <td> 
              <p>　　THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS have witnessed a carnival of brutality. 
                From cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion. 
                I scarcely know where to begin. Wolf Larsen was really the cause 
                of it. The relations among the men, strained and made tense by 
                feuds, quarrels, and grudges, were in a state of unstable equilibrium. 
                Wolf Larsen disturbed the equilibrium, and evil passions flared 
                up like flame in prairie-grass. </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge was proving himself a sneak, a spy, an informer. 
                He attempted to curry favor and reinstate himself in the good 
                graces of the captain by carrying tales of the men forward. He 
                it was, I know, that carried some of Johnson's hasty talk to Wolf 
                Larsen. Johnson, it seems, had bought a suit of oilskins from 
                the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly inferior quality. 
                Nor was he slow in advertising the fact. The slop-chest is a sort 
                of miniature dry-goods store which is carried by all sealing-schooners 
                and which is stocked with articles peculiar to the needs of the 
                sailors. Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his subsequent 
                earnings on the sealing-grounds; for, as it is with the hunters, 
                so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers: in the place of wages, 
                they receive a 'lay,' a rate of so much per skin for every skin 
                captured in their particular boat. </p>
              <p>　　But of Johnson's grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing, 
                so that what I witnessed came with the shock of sudden surprise. 
                I had just finished sweeping the cabin, and had been inveigled 
                by Wolf Larsen into a discussion of Hamlet, his favorite Shakespearean 
                character, when Johansen descended the companion-stairs, followed 
                by Johnson. The latter's cap came off, after the custom of the 
                sea, and he stood respectfully in the middle of the cabin, swaying 
                heavily and uneasily to the roll of the schooner, and facing the 
                captain. </p>
              <p>　　'Shut the doors and draw the slide,' Wolf Larsen said to me. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I noticed an anxious light in Johnson's eyes, but mistook it 
                for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man. The mate, 
                Johansen, stood away several feet to the side of him, and fully 
                three yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the revolving 
                cabin chairs. An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the 
                doors and drawn the slide- a pause that must have lasted fully 
                a minute. It was broken by Wolf Larsen. </p>
              <p>　　'Yonson,' he began. </p>
              <p>　　'My name is Johnson, sir,' the sailor boldly corrected. </p>
              <p>　　'Well, Johnson, then,- you! Can you guess why I have sent for 
                you?' </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, and no, sir,' was the slow reply. 'My work is done well. 
                The mate knows that, and you know it, sir. So there cannot be 
                any complaint.' </p>
              <p>　　'And is that all?' Wolf Larsen queried, his voice soft and 
                low and purring. </p>
              <p>　　'I know you have it in for me,' Johnson continued with his 
                unalterable and ponderous slowness. 'You do not like me. You- 
                you-' </p>
              <p>　　'Go on,' Wolf Larsen prompted. 'Don't be afraid of my feelings.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I am not afraid,' the sailor retorted, a slight angry flush 
                rising through his sunburn. 'You do not like me because I am too 
                much of a man, that is why, sir.' </p>
              <p>　　'You are too much of a man for ship discipline, if that is 
                what you mean, and if you know what I mean,' was Wolf Larsen's 
                retort. </p>
              <p>　　'I know English, and I know what you mean, sir,' Johnson answered, 
                his flush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English 
                language. </p>
              <p>　　'Johnson,' Wolf Larsen said, with an air of dismissing all 
                that had gone before as introductory to the main business in hand, 
                'I understand you're not quite satisfied with those oilskins.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'No, I am not. They are no good, sir.' </p>
              <p>　　'And you've been shooting off your mouth about them.' </p>
              <p>　　'I say what I think, sir,' the sailor answered courageously, 
                not failing at the same time in ship courtesy, which demanded 
                that 'sir' be appended to each speech he made. </p>
              <p>　　It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Johansen. 
                His big fists were clenching and unclenching, and his face was 
                positively fiendish, so malignantly did he look at Johnson. I 
                noticed a black discoloration, still faintly visible, under Johansen's 
                eye, a mark of the thrashing he had received a few nights before 
                from the sailor. For the first time I began to divine that something 
                terrible was about to be enacted- what, I could not imagine. </p>
              <p>　　'Do you know what happens to men who say what you've said about 
                my slop-chest and me?' Wolf Larsen was demanding. </p>
              <p>　　'I know, sir,' was the answer. </p>
              <p>　　'What?' Wolf Larsen demanded sharply and imperatively. </p>
              <p>　　'What you and the mate there are going to do to me, sir.' </p>
              <p>　　At this Larsen sprang from the sitting posture like a wild 
                animal, a tiger, and like a tiger covered the intervening space 
                in an avalanche of fury that Johnson strove vainly to fend off. 
                He threw one arm down to protect the stomach, the other arm up 
                to protect the head; but Wolf Larsen's fist drove midway between, 
                on the chest, with a crushing, resounding impact. Johnson's breath, 
                suddenly expelled, shot from his mouth, and as suddenly checked, 
                with the forced, audible expiration of a man wielding an ax. He 
                almost fell backward, and swayed from side to side in an effort 
                to recover his balance. </p>
              <p>　　Johnson fought bravely enough, but he was no match for Wolf 
                Larsen, much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate. It was frightful. 
                I had not imagined a human being could endure so much and still 
                live and struggle on. And struggle on Johnson did. Of course there 
                was no hope for him, not the slightest, and he knew it as well 
                as I, but by the manhood that was in him he could not cease from 
                fighting for that manhood. </p>
              <p>　　It was too much for me to witness. I felt that I should lose 
                my mind, and I ran up the companion-stairs to open the doors and 
                escape on deck. But Wolf Larsen, leaving his victim for the moment, 
                and with one of his tremendous springs, gained my side, and flung 
                me into the far corner of the cabin. </p>
              <p>　　'The phenomenon of life, Hump,' he girded at me. 'Stay and 
                watch it. You may gather data on the immortality of the soul. 
                Besides, you know, we can't hurt Johnson's soul. It's only the 
                fleeting form we may demolish.' </p>
              <p>　　It seemed centuries, possibly it was no more than ten minutes, 
                that the beating continued. And when Johnson could no longer rise, 
                they still continued to beat and kick him where he lay. </p>
              <p>　　'Easy, Johansen; easy as she goes,' Wolf Larsen finally said. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But the beast in the mate was up and rampant, and Wolf Larsen 
                was compelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the 
                arm, gentle enough, apparently, but which hurled Johansen back 
                like a cork, driving his head against the wall with a crash. He 
                fell to the floor, half stunned for the moment, breathing heavily 
                and blinking his eyes in a stupid sort of way. </p>
              <p>　　'Jerk open the doors, Hump,' Larsen commanded. </p>
              <p>　　I obeyed, and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like 
                a sack of rubbish and hove him clear up the companion-stairs, 
                through the narrow doors, and out on deck. Louis, his boat-mate, 
                gave a turn of the wheel and gazed imperturbably into the binnacle. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Not so George Leach, the erstwhile cabin-boy. Fore and aft 
                there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his consequent 
                behavior. He it was that came up on the poop, without orders, 
                and dragged Johnson forward, where he set about dressing his wounds 
                as well as he could and making him comfortable. </p>
              <p>　　I had come up on deck for a breath of fresh air and to try 
                to get some repose for my overwrought nerves. Wolf Larsen was 
                smoking a cigar and examining the patent log which the Ghost usually 
                towed astern, but which had been hauled in for some purpose. Suddenly 
                Leach's voice came to my ears. It was tense and hoarse with an 
                overmastering rage. I turned and saw him standing just beneath 
                the break of the poop on the port side of the galley. His face 
                was convulsed and white, his eyes were flashing, his clenched 
                fists raised overhead, as the boy hurled his imprecations recklessly 
                full in the face of the captain, who had sauntered slowly forward 
                to the break of the poop, and leaning his elbow on the corner 
                of the cabin, gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited 
                boy. </p>
              <p>　　Leach went on, indicting Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted 
                before. The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside 
                the forecastle scuttle, and watched and listened. The hunters 
                piled pell-mell out of the steerage, but as Leach's tirade continued 
                I saw that there was no levity in their faces. Even they were 
                frightened, not at the boy's terrible words, but at his terrible 
                audacity. It did not seem possible that any living creature could 
                thus beard Wolf Larsen to his teeth. I know for myself that I 
                was shocked into admiration of the boy, and I saw in him the splendid 
                invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the fears 
                of the flesh, as in the prophets of old, to condemn unrighteousness. 
              </p>
              <p>　　And such condemnation! He haled forth Wolf Larsen's soul naked 
                to the scorn of men. He rained upon it curses from God and high 
                heaven, and withered it with a heat of invective that savored 
                of a medieval excommunication of the Catholic Church. He ran the 
                gamut of denunciation, rising to heights of wrath, and from sheer 
                exhaustion sinking to the most indecent abuse. </p>
              <p>　　Everybody looked for Larsen to leap upon the boy and destroy 
                him. But it was not his whim. His cigar went out, and he continued 
                to gaze silently and curiously. </p>
              <p>　　Leach had worked himself into an ecstasy of impotent rage. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Pig! Pig! Pig!' he was reiterating at the top of his lungs. 
                'Why don't you come down and kill me, you murderer? You can do 
                it. I ain't afraid. There's no one to stop you! Come on, you coward! 
                Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!' </p>
              <p>　　It was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge's erratic soul brought 
                him into the scene. He had been listening at the galley door, 
                but he now came out, ostensibly to fling some scraps over the 
                side, but obviously to see the killing he was certain would take 
                place. He smirked greasily up into the face of Wolf Larsen, who 
                seemed not to see him. But the Cockney was unabashed, and turned 
                to Leach, saying: </p>
              <p>　　'Such language! Shockin'!' </p>
              <p>　　Leach's rage was no longer impotent. Here at last was something 
                ready to hand, and for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney 
                had appeared outside the galley without his knife. The words had 
                barely left his mouth when he was knocked down by Leach. Three 
                times he struggled to his feet, striving to gain the galley, and 
                each time was knocked down. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, Lord!' he cried. ''Elp! 'Elp! Tyke 'im aw'y, carn't yer? 
                Tyke 'im aw'y!' </p>
              <p>　　The hunters laughed from sheer relief. Tragedy had dwindled, 
                the farce had begun. The sailors now crowded boldly aft, grinning 
                and shuffling, to watch the pommeling of the hated Cockney. And 
                even I felt a great joy surge up within me. I confess that I delighted 
                in this beating Leach was giving to Thomas Mugridge, though it 
                was as terrible, almost, as the one Mugridge had caused to be 
                given to Johnson. But the expression of Wolf Larsen's face did 
                not change,- nor did his position. For all his pragmatic certitude, 
                it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in the 
                hope of discovering something more about it. And no one interfered. 
                Leach could have killed the Cockney, but, having evidently filled 
                the measure of his vengeance, he drew away from his prostrate 
                foe, who was whimpering and wailing in a puppyish sort of way, 
                and walked forward. </p>
              <p>　　But these two affairs were only the opening events of the day's 
                program. In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each 
                other, and a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage, followed 
                by a stampede of the other four hunters for the deck. A column 
                of thick, acrid smoke, the kind always made by black powder, was 
                arising through the open companion-way, and down through it leaped 
                Wolf Larsen. The sound of blows and scuffling came to our ears. 
                Both men were wounded, and he was thrashing them both for having 
                disobeyed his orders and crippled themselves in advance of the 
                hunting season. In fact, they were badly wounded, and, having 
                thrashed them, he proceeded to operate upon them in a rough surgical 
                fashion and to dress their wounds. I served as assistant while 
                he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets, and I 
                saw the two men endure his crude surgery without anesthetics and 
                with no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whiskey. </p>
              <p>　　Then, in the first dog-watch, trouble came to a head in the 
                forecastle. It took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing 
                that had been the cause of Johnson's beating, and from the noise 
                we heard, and from the sight of the bruised men next day, it was 
                patent that half the forecastle had soundly drubbed the other 
                half. </p>
              <p>　　The second dog-watch and the day wound up with a fight between 
                Johansen and the lean, Yankee-looking hunter, Latimer. It was 
                caused by some remarks of Latimer's concerning the noises made 
                by the mate in his sleep, and though Johansen was whipped, he 
                kept the steerage awake for the rest of the night while he blissfully 
                slumbered and fought the fight over and over again.</p>

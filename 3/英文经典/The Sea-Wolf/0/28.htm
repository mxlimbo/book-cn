              <p>　　THERE IS NO NEED OF GOING into an extended recital of our suffering 
                in the small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted, 
                here and there, willy-nilly, across the ocean. The high wind blew 
                from the northwest for twenty-four hours, when it fell calm, and 
                in the night sprang up from the southwest. This was dead in our 
                teeth, but I took in the sea-anchor and set sail, hauling a course 
                on the wind that took us in a south-southeasterly direction. It 
                was an even choice between this and the west-northwesterly course 
                that the wind permitted; but the warm airs of the south fanned 
                my desire for a warmer sea and swayed my decision. </p>
              <p>　　In three hours- it was midnight, I well remember, and as dark 
                as I had ever seen it on the sea- the wind, still blowing out 
                of the southwest, rose furiously, and once again I was compelled 
                to set the sea-anchor. </p>
              <p>　　Day broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white, 
                the boat pitching, almost on end, to its drag. We were in imminent 
                danger of being swamped by the whitecaps. As it was, spray and 
                spume came aboard in such quantities that I baled without cessation. 
                The blankets were soaking. Everything was wet except Maud, and 
                she, in oilskins, rubber boots, and souwester, was dry, all but 
                her face and hands and a stray wisp of hair. She relieved me at 
                the baling-hole from time to time, and bravely she threw out the 
                water and faced the storm. All things are relative. It was no 
                more than a stiff blow; but to us, fighting for life in our frail 
                craft, it was indeed a storm. </p>
              <p>　　Cold and cheerless, the wind beating on our faces, the white 
                seas roaring by, we struggled through the day. Night came, but 
                neither of us slept. Day came, and still the wind beat on our 
                faces and the white seas roared past. By the second night Maud 
                was falling asleep from exhaustion. I covered her with oilskins 
                and a tarpaulin. She was comparatively dry, but she was numb with 
                the cold. I feared greatly that she might die in the night; but 
                day broke, cold and cheerless, with the same clouded sky and beating 
                wind and roaring seas. </p>
              <p>　　I had had no sleep for forty-eight hours. I was wet and chilled 
                to the marrow, till I felt more dead than alive. My body was stiff 
                from exertion as well as from cold, and my aching muscles gave 
                me the severest torture whenever I used them- and I used them 
                continually. And all the time we were being driven off into the 
                northeast, directly away from Japan and toward bleak Bering Sea. 
              </p>
              <p>　　And still we lived, and the boat lived, and the wind blew unabated. 
                In fact, toward nightfall of the third day it increased a trifle 
                and something more. The boat's bow plunged under a crest, and 
                we came through quarter full of water. I baled like a madman. 
                The liability of shipping another such sea was enormously increased 
                by the water that weighed the boat down and robbed it of its buoyancy. 
                And another such sea meant the end. When I had the boat empty 
                again I was forced to take away the tarpaulin that covered Maud, 
                in order that I might lash it down across the bow. It was well 
                I did, for it covered the boat fully a third of the way aft, and 
                three times in the next several hours it flung off the bulk of 
                the down-rushing water when the bow shoved under the seas. </p>
              <p>　　Maud's condition was pitiable. She sat crouched in the bottom 
                of the boat, her lips blue, her face gray and plainly showing 
                the pain she suffered. But ever her eyes looked bravely at me, 
                and ever her lips uttered brave words. </p>
              <p>　　The worst of the storm must have blown that night, though little 
                I noticed it. I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets. 
                The morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle 
                whisper, the sea dying down, and the sun shining upon us. Oh, 
                the blessed sun! How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious 
                warmth, reviving like insects and crawling things after a storm! 
                We smiled again, said amusing things, and waxed optimistic over 
                our situation. Yet it was, if anything, worse than ever. We were 
                farther away from Japan than the night we left the Ghost. Nor 
                could I more than roughly guess our latitude and longitude. At 
                a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour, during the seventy 
                and odd hours of the storm we had been driven at least one hundred 
                and fifty miles to the northeast. But was such calculated drift 
                correct? For all I knew, it might have been four miles per hour 
                instead of two, in which case we were another hundred and fifty 
                miles to the bad. </p>
              <p>　　Where we were I did not know, though there was quite a likelihood 
                that we were in the vicinity of the Ghost. There were seals about 
                us, and I was prepared to sight a sealing-schooner at any time. 
                We did sight one, in the afternoon, when the northwest breeze 
                had sprung up freshly once more; but the strange schooner lost 
                itself on the skyline, and we alone occupied the circle of the 
                sea. </p>
              <p>　　Came days of fog, when even Maud's spirit drooped and there 
                were no merry words upon her lips; days of calm, when we floated 
                on the lonely immensity of sea, oppressed by its greatness and 
                yet marveling at the miracle of tiny life, for we still lived 
                and struggled to live; days of sleet and wind and snow-squalls, 
                when nothing could keep us warm; or days of drizzling rain, when 
                we filled our water-breakers from the drip of the wet sail. </p>
              <p>　　And ever I loved Maud with an increasing love. She was so many-sided, 
                so many-mooded- 'Protean-mooded' I called her. But I called her 
                this, and other and dearer things, in my thoughts only. Though 
                the declaration of my love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand 
                times, I knew that it was no time for such a declaration. If for 
                no other reason, it was no time, when one was protecting and trying 
                to save a woman, to ask that woman for her love. Delicate as was 
                the situation, not alone in this but in other ways, I flattered 
                myself that I was able to deal delicately with it; and also I 
                flattered myself that by look or sign I gave no advertisement 
                of the love I felt for her. We were like good comrades, and we 
                grew better comrades as the days went by. </p>
              <p>　　One thing about her that surprised me was her lack of timidity 
                and fear. The terrible sea, the frail-boat, the storms, the suffering, 
                the strangeness and isolation of the situation,- all that should 
                have frightened a robust woman,- seemed to make no impression 
                upon her who had known life only in its most sheltered and consummately 
                artificial aspects, and who was herself all fire and dew and mist, 
                sublimated spirit- all that was soft and tender and clinging in 
                woman. And yet I am wrong. She was timid and afraid, but she possessed 
                courage. The flesh and the qualms of the flesh she was heir to, 
                but the flesh bore heavily only on the flesh. And she was spirit, 
                first and always spirit, etherealized essence of life, as calm 
                as her calm eyes, and sure of permanence in the changing order 
                of the universe. </p>
              <p>　　Came days of storm, days and nights of storm, when the ocean 
                menaced us with its roaring whiteness and the wind smote our struggling 
                boat with a Titan's buffets. And ever we were flung off farther 
                and farther to the northeast. It was in such a storm, and the 
                worst that we had experienced, that I cast a weary glance to leeward, 
                not in quest of anything, but more from the weariness of facing 
                the elemental strife and in mute appeal, almost, to the wrathful 
                powers to cease and let us be. What I saw I could not at first 
                believe; days and nights of sleeplessness and anxiety had doubtless 
                turned my head. I looked back at Maud, to identify myself, as 
                it were, in time and space. The sight of her dear wet cheeks, 
                her flying hair, and her brave brown eyes convinced me that my 
                vision was still healthy. Again I turned my face to leeward, and 
                again I saw the jutting promontory, black and high and naked, 
                the raging surf that broke about its base and beat its front high 
                up with spouting fountains, the black and forbidding coastline 
                running toward the southeast and fringed with a tremendous scarf 
                of white. </p>
              <p>　　'Maud,' I said, 'Maud.' </p>
              <p>　　She turned her head and beheld the sight. </p>
              <p>　　'It cannot be Alaska!' she cried. </p>
              <p>　　'No,' I answered; and asked, 'Can you swim?' </p>
              <p>　　She shook her head. </p>
              <p>　　'Neither can I,' I said. 'So we must get ashore without swimming, 
                in some opening between the rocks through which we can drive the 
                boat and clamber out. But we must be quick, very quick- and sure.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I spoke with a confidence she knew I did not feel, for she 
                looked at me with that unfaltering gaze of hers, and said: </p>
              <p>　　'I have not thanked you yet for all you have done for me, but-' 
                She hesitated, as if in doubt how best to word her gratitude. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Well?' I said brutally, for I was not quite pleased with her 
                thanking me. </p>
              <p>　　'You might help me,' she smiled. </p>
              <p>　　'To acknowledge your obligations before you die? Not at all. 
                We are not going to die. We shall land on that island, and we 
                shall be snug and sheltered before the day is done.' </p>
              <p>　　I spoke stoutly, but I did not believe a word. Nor was I prompted 
                to lie through fear. I felt no fear, though I was sure of death 
                in that boiling surge among the rocks which was rapidly growing 
                nearer. It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore. 
                The wind would instantly capsize the boat; the seas would swamp 
                it the moment it fell into the trough; and, besides, the sail, 
                lashed to the spare oars, dragged in the sea ahead of us. </p>
              <p>　　As I say, I was not afraid to meet my own death there, a few 
                hundred yards to leeward; but I was appalled at the thought that 
                Maud must die. My cursed imagination saw her beaten and mangled 
                against the rocks, and it was too terrible. I strove to compel 
                myself to think we would make the landing safely, and so I spoke 
                not what I believed, but what I preferred to believe. </p>
              <p>　　I recoiled before contemplation of that frightful death, and 
                for a moment I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in my 
                arms and leaping overboard. Then I resolved to wait, and at the 
                last moment, when we entered on the final stretch, to take her 
                in my arms and proclaim my love, and, with her in my embrace, 
                to make the desperate struggle and die. </p>
              <p>　　Instinctively we drew closer together in the bottom of the 
                boat. I felt her mittened hand come out to mine; and thus, without 
                speech, we waited the end. We were not far off the line the wind 
                made with the western edge of the promontory, and I watched in 
                the hope that some set of the current or send of the sea would 
                drift us past before we reached the surf. </p>
              <p>　　'We shall go clear,' I said, with a confidence that I knew 
                deceived neither of us. Five minutes later I cried: 'By God! We 
                shall go clear!' </p>
              <p>　　The oath left my lips in my excitement- the first, I do believe, 
                in my life, unless 'trouble it,' an expletive of my youth, be 
                accounted an oath. </p>
              <p>　　'I beg your pardon,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'You have convinced me for the first time of your sincerity,' 
                she said, with a faint smile. 'I do know now that we shall go 
                clear.' </p>
              <p>　　I had seen a distant headland past the extreme edge of the 
                promontory, and as we looked we could see grow the intervening 
                coastline of what was evidently a deep cove. At the same time 
                there broke upon our ears a continuous and mighty bellowing. It 
                partook of the magnitude and volume of distant thunder, and it 
                came to us directly from leeward, rising above the crash of the 
                surf and traveling directly in the teeth of the storm. As we passed 
                the point, the whole cove burst upon our view, a half-moon of 
                white sandy beach upon which broke a huge surf and which was covered 
                with myriads of seals. It was from them that the great bellowing 
                went up. </p>
              <p>　　'A rookery!' I cried. 'Now are we indeed saved. There must 
                be men and cruisers to protect them from the seal-hunters. Possibly 
                there is a station ashore.' </p>
              <p>　　But as I studied the surf that beat upon the beach, I said: 
                'Still bad, but not so bad. And now, if the gods be truly kind, 
                we shall drift by that next headland and come upon a perfectly 
                sheltered beach where we may land without wetting our feet.' </p>
              <p>　　And the gods were kind. The first and second headlands were 
                directly in line with the southwest wind; but once around the 
                second,- and we went perilously close,- we picked up the third 
                headland, still in line with the wind and with the other two. 
                But the cove that intervened! It penetrated deep into the land, 
                and the tide, setting in, drifted us under the shelter of the 
                point. Here the sea was calm, save for a heavy but smooth ground-swell, 
                and I took in the sea-anchor and began to row. From the point 
                the shore curved away more and more to the south and west, until, 
                at last, it disclosed a cove within the cove, a little landlocked 
                harbor, the water as level as a pond, broken only by tiny ripples, 
                where vagrant breaths and wisps of the storm hurtled down from 
                over the frowning wall of rock that backed the beach a hundred 
                feet inshore. </p>
              <p>　　Here were no seals whatever. The boat's stem touched the hard 
                shingle. I sprang out, extending my hand to Maud. The next moment 
                she was beside me. As my fingers released hers, she clutched for 
                my arm hastily. At the same moment I swayed, as if about to fall 
                to the sand. This was the startling effect of the cessation of 
                motion. We had been so long upon the moving, rocking sea that 
                the stable land was a shock to us. We expected the beach to lift 
                up this way and that, and the rocky walls to swing back and forth 
                like the sides of a ship; and when we braced ourselves automatically 
                for these various expected movements, their non-occurrence quite 
                overcame our equilibrium. </p>
              <p>　　'I really must sit down,' Maud said, with a nervous laugh and 
                a dizzy gesture, and forthwith she sat down on the sand. </p>
              <p>　　I attended to making the boat secure and joined her. Thus we 
                landed on Endeavor Island, as we called it, land-sick from long

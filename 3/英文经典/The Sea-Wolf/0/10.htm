              <p>　　MY INTIMACY WITH Wolf Larsen increased, if by intimacy may 
                be denoted those relations which exist between master and man, 
                or, better yet, between king and jester. I was to him no more 
                than a toy, and he valued me no more than a child values a toy. 
                My function was to amuse, and so long as I amused all went well; 
                but let him become bored, or let him have one of his black moods 
                come upon him, and at once I was relegated from cabin table to 
                galley, while, at the same time, I was fortunate to escape with 
                my life and a whole body. </p>
              <p>　　The loneliness of the man was slowly being borne in upon me. 
                There was not a man aboard but hated or feared him, nor was there 
                a man whom he did not despise. He seemed consuming with the tremendous 
                power that was in him and that seemed never to have found adequate 
                expression in works. He was as Lucifer would be, were that proud 
                spirit banished to a society of soulless, Tomlinsonian ghosts. 
              </p>
              <p>　　This loneliness was bad enough in itself, but, to make it worse, 
                he was oppressed by the primal melancholy of the race. Knowing 
                him, I reviewed the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. 
                The white-skinned, fair-haired savages who created that terrible 
                pantheon were of the same fiber as he. The frivolity of the laughter-loving 
                Latins was no part of him. When he laughed it was from a humor 
                that was nothing else than ferocious. But he laughed rarely; he 
                was too often sad. And it was a sadness as deep-reaching as the 
                roots of the race. It was the race heritage, the sadness which 
                had made the race sober-minded, clean-lived, and fanatically moral. 
              </p>
              <p>　　In point of fact, the chief vent to this primal melancholy 
                has been religion in its more agonizing forms. But the compensations 
                of such religion were denied Wolf Larsen. His brutal materialism 
                would not permit it. So, when his blue moods came on, nothing 
                remained for him but to be devilish. Had he not been so terrible 
                a man, I could sometimes have felt sorry for him, as, for instance, 
                one morning when I went into his state-room to fill his water-bottle 
                and came unexpectedly upon him. He did not see me. His head was 
                buried in his hands, and his shoulders were heaving convulsively 
                as with sobs. He seemed torn by some mighty grief. As I softly 
                withdrew, I could hear him groaning, 'God! God! God!' Not that 
                he was calling upon God; it was a mere expletive, but it came 
                from his soul. </p>
              <p>　　At dinner he asked the hunters for a remedy for headache, and 
                by evening, strong man that he was, he was half blind, and reeling 
                about the cabin. </p>
              <p>　　'I've never been sick in my life, Hump,' he said, as I guided 
                him to his room. 'Nor did I ever have a headache except the time 
                my head was healing after having been laid open for six inches 
                by a capstan-bar.' </p>
              <p>　　For three days this blinding headache lasted, and he suffered 
                as wild animals suffer, as it seemed the way on ship to suffer, 
                without plaint, without sympathy, utterly alone. </p>
              <p>　　This morning, however, on entering his state-room to make the 
                bed and put things in order, I found him well and hard at work. 
                Table and bunk were littered with designs and calculations. On 
                a large transparent sheet, compass and square in hand, he was 
                copying what appeared to be a scale of some sort or other. </p>
              <p>　　'Hello, Hump!' he greeted me genially. 'I'm just finished the 
                finishing touches. Want to see it work?' </p>
              <p>　　'But what is it?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　'A labor-saving device for mariners, navigation reduced to 
                kindergarten simplicity,' he answered gaily. 'From today a child 
                will be able to navigate a ship. No more long-winded calculations. 
                All you need is one star in the sky on dirty night to know instantly 
                where you are. Look. I place the transparent scale on this star-map, 
                revolving the scale on the North Pole. On the scale I've worked 
                out the circles of altitude and the lines of bearing. All I do 
                is put it on a star, revolve the scale till it is opposite those 
                figures on the map underneath, and presto, there you are, the 
                ship's precise location!' </p>
              <p>　　There was a ring of triumph in his voice, and his eyes, clear 
                blue this morning as the sea, were sparkling with light. </p>
              <p>　　'You must be well up in mathematics,' I said. 'Where did you 
                go to school?' 'Never saw the inside of one, worse luck,' was 
                the answer. 'I had to dig it out for myself. </p>
              <p>　　'And why do you think I have made this thing?' he demanded 
                abruptly. 'Dreaming to leave footprints on the sands of time?' 
                He laughed one of his horrible mocking laughs. 'Not at all. To 
                get it patented, to make money from it, to revel in piggishness, 
                with all night in while other men do the work. That's my purpose. 
                Also, I have enjoyed working it out.' </p>
              <p>　　'The creative joy,' I murmured. </p>
              <p>　　'I guess that's what it ought to be called. Which is another 
                way of expressing the joy of life in that it is alive, the triumph 
                of movement over matter, of the quick over the dead, the pride 
                of the yeast because it is yeast and crawls.' </p>
              <p>　　I threw up my hands with helpless disapproval of his inveterate 
                materialism, and went about making the bed. He continued copying 
                lines and figures upon the transparent scale. It was a task requiring 
                the utmost nicety and precision, and I could not but admire the 
                way he tempered his strength to the fineness and delicacy of the 
                need. </p>
              <p>　　When I had finished the bed, I caught myself looking at him 
                in a fascinated sort of way. He was certainly a handsome man- 
                beautiful in the masculine sense. And again, with never-failing 
                wonder, I remarked the total lack of viciousness, or wickedness, 
                or sinfulness, in his face. It was the face, I am convinced, of 
                a man who did no wrong. And by this I do not wish to be misunderstood. 
                What I mean is that it was the face of a man who either did nothing 
                contrary to the dictates of his conscience, or who had no conscience. 
                I incline to the latter way of accounting for it. He was a magnificent 
                atavism, a man so purely primitive that he was of the type that 
                came into the world before the development of the moral nature. 
                He was not immoral, but merely unmoral. </p>
              <p>　　As I have said, in the masculine sense his was a beautiful 
                face. Smooth-shaven, every line was distinct, and it was cut as 
                clear and sharp as a cameo; while sea and sun had tanned the naturally 
                fair skin to a dark bronze which bespoke struggle and battle, 
                and added to both his savagery and his beauty. The lips were full, 
                yet possessed of the firmness, almost harshness, which is characteristic 
                of thin lips. The set of his mouth, his chin, his jaw, was likewise 
                firm or harsh, with all the fierceness and indomitableness of 
                the male; the nose also. It was the nose of a being born to conquer 
                and command. It just hinted of the eagle beak. It might have been 
                Grecian, it might have been Roman, only it was a shade too massive 
                for the one, a shade too delicate for the other. And while the 
                whole face was the incarnation of fierceness and strength, the 
                primal melancholy from which he suffered seemed to greaten the 
                lines of mouth and eye and brow, seemed to give a largeness and 
                completeness which otherwise the face would have lacked. </p>
              <p>　　And so I caught myself standing idly and studying him. I cannot 
                say how greatly the man had come to interest me. Who was he? What 
                was he? How had he happened to be? All powers seemed his, all 
                potentialities; why, then, was he no more than the obscure master 
                of a seal-hunting schooner, with a reputation for frightful brutality 
                among the men who hunted seals? </p>
              <p>　　My curiosity burst from me in a flood of speech: </p>
              <p>　　'Why is it that you have not done great things in this world? 
                With the power that is yours you might have risen to any height. 
                Unpossessed of conscience or moral instinct, you might have mastered 
                the world, broken it to your hand. And yet here you are, at the 
                top of your life, where diminishing and dying begin, living an 
                obscure and sordid existence hunting sea-animals for the satisfaction 
                of woman's vanity and love of decoration, reveling in a piggishness, 
                to use your own words, which is anything and everything except 
                splendid. Why, with all that wonderful strength, have you not 
                done something? There was nothing to stop you, nothing that could 
                stop you. What was wrong? Did you lack ambition? Did you fall 
                under temptation? What was the matter? What was the matter?' </p>
              <p>　　He had lifted his eyes to me at the beginning of my outburst 
                and followed me complacently until I had done and stood before 
                him breathless and dismayed. He waited a moment, as though seeing 
                where to begin, and then said: </p>
              <p>　　'Hump, do you know the parable of the sower who went forth 
                to sow? If you will remember, some of the seed fell upon stony 
                places, where there was not much earth, and forthwith they sprung 
                up because they had no deepness of earth. And when the sun was 
                up, they were scorched; and because they had no root they withered 
                away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and 
                choked them.' </p>
              <p>　　'Well?' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Well?' he queried half petulantly. 'It was not well. I was 
                one of those seeds.' </p>
              <p>　　He dropped his head to the scale and resumed the copying. I 
                finished my work, and had opened the door to leave, when he spoke 
                to me. </p>
              <p>　　'Hump, if you will look on the west coast of the map of Norway 
                you will see an indentation called Romsdal Fiord. I was born within 
                a hundred miles of that stretch of water. But I was not born Norwegian. 
                I am a Dane. My father and mother were Danes, and how they ever 
                came to that bleak bight of land on the west coast I do not know. 
                I never heard. Outside of that, there is nothing mysterious. They 
                were poor people and unlettered. They came of generations of poor, 
                unlettered people- peasants of the sea who sowed their sons on 
                the waves as has been their custom since time began. There is 
                no more to tell.' </p>
              <p>　　'But there is,' I objected. 'It is still obscure to me.' </p>
              <p>　　'What can I tell you,' he demanded, with a recrudescence of 
                fierceness, 'of the meagerness of a child's life- of fish diet 
                and coarse living; of going out with the boats from the time I 
                could crawl; of my brothers, who went away one by one to the deep-sea 
                farming and never came back; of myself, unable to read or write, 
                cabin-boy at the mature age of ten on the coastwise, old-country 
                ships; of the rough fare and rougher usage, where kicks and blows 
                were bed and breakfast and took the place of speech, and fear 
                and hatred and pain were my only soul-experiences? I do not care 
                to remember. A madness comes up in my brain even now as I think 
                of it. But there were coastwise skippers I would have sought and 
                killed when a man's strength came to me, only the lines of my 
                life were cast at the time in other places. I did return, not 
                long ago, but unfortunately the skippers were dead, all but one, 
                a mate in the old days, a skipper when I met him, and when I left 
                him, a cripple who would never walk again.' </p>
              <p>　　'But you who read Spencer and Darwin and have never seen the 
                inside of a school, how did you learn to read and write?' I queried. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'In the English merchant service. Cabin-boy at twelve, ship's 
                boy at fourteen, ordinary seaman at sixteen, able seaman at seventeen 
                and cock of the fo'c's'le; infinite ambition and infinite loneliness, 
                receiving neither help nor sympathy, I did it all for myself- 
                navigation, mathematics, science, literature, and what not. And 
                of what use has it been? Master and owner of a ship at the top 
                of my life, as you say, when I am beginning to diminish and die. 
                Paltry, isn't it? And when the sun was up I was scorched, and 
                because I had no root I withered away.' </p>
              <p>　　'But history tells of slaves who rose to the purple,' I chided. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'And history tells of opportunities that came to the slaves 
                who rose to the purple,' he answered grimly. 'No man makes opportunity. 
                All the great men ever did was to know it when it came to them. 
                The Corsican knew. I have dreamed as greatly as the Corsican. 
                I should have known the opportunity, but it never came. The thorns 
                sprung up and choked me. And, Hump, I can tell you that you know 
                more about me than any living man except my own brother.' </p>
              <p>　　'And what is he? And where is he?' </p>
              <p>　　'Master of the steamship Macedonia, seal-hunter,' was the answer. 
                'We will meet him most probably on the Japan coast. Men call him 
                &quot;Death&quot; Larsen.' </p>
              <p>　　'Death Larsen!' I involuntarily cried. 'Is he like you?' </p>
              <p>　　'Hardly. He is a lump of an animal without any head. He has 
                all my- my-' </p>
              <p>　　'Brutishness,' I suggested. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, thank you for the word- all my brutishness; but he can 
                scarcely read or write.' </p>
              <p>　　'And he has never philosophized on life,' I added. </p>
              <p>　　'No,' Wolf Larsen answered, with an indescribable air of sadness. 
                'And he is all the happier for leaving life alone. He is too busy 
                living it to think about it. My mistake was in ever opening the 
                books.' </p>

            <td>　　BRAVE WINDS, BLOWING FAIR, swiftly drove the Ghost northward 
              into the sealherd. We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth 
              parallel, in a raw and stormy sea across which the wind harried 
              the fog-banks in eternal flight. For days at a time we could never 
              see the sun or take an observation; then the wind would sweep the 
              face of the ocean clean, the waves would ripple and flash, and we 
              would learn where we were. A day of clear weather might follow, 
              or three days or four, and then the fog would settle down upon us 
              seemingly thicker than ever. 
              <p>　　The hunting was perilous; yet the boats were lowered day after 
                day, were swallowed up in the gray obscurity, and were seen no 
                more till nightfall, and often not till long after, when they 
                would creep in like sea-wraiths, one by one, out of the gray. 
                Wainwright, the hunter whom Wolf Larsen had stolen with boat and 
                men, took advantage of the veiled sea and escaped. He disappeared 
                one morning in the encircling fog with his two men, and we never 
                saw them again, though it was not many days before we learned 
                that they had passed from schooner to schooner until they finally 
                regained their own. </p>
              <p>　　This was the thing I had set my mind upon doing, but the opportunity 
                never offered. It was not in the mate's province to go out in 
                the boats, and though I maneuvered cunningly for it, Wolf Larsen 
                never granted me the privilege. Had he done so, I should have 
                managed somehow to carry Miss Brewster away with me. As it was, 
                the situation was approaching a stage which I was afraid to consider. 
                I involuntarily shunned the thought of it, and yet the thought 
                continually arose in my mind like a haunting specter. </p>
              <p>　　I had read sea-romances in my time, wherein figured, as a matter 
                of course, the lone woman in the midst of a shipload of men; but 
                I learned now that I had never comprehended the deeper significance 
                of such a situation- the thing the writers harped upon and exploited 
                so thoroughly. And here it was now, and I was face to face with 
                it. That it should be as vital as possible, it required no more 
                than that the woman should be Maud Brewster, who now charmed me 
                in person as she had long charmed me through her work. </p>
              <p>　　No one more out of environment could be imagined. She was a 
                delicate, ethereal creature, swaying and willowy, light and graceful 
                of movement. It never seemed to me that she walked, or, at least, 
                walked after the ordinary manner of mortals. Hers was an extreme 
                lithesomeness, and she moved with a certain indefinable airiness, 
                approaching one as down might float or as bird on noiseless wings. 
              </p>
              <p>　　She was like a bit of Dresden china, and I was continually 
                impressed with what I may call her fragility. As at the time I 
                caught her arm when helping her below, so at any time I was quite 
                prepared, should stress or rough handling befall her, to see her 
                crumble away. I have never seen body and spirit in such perfect 
                accord. Describe her verse, as the critics have, as sublimated 
                and spiritual, and you have described her body. It seemed to partake 
                of her soul, to have analogous attributes, and to link it to life 
                with the slenderest of chains. Indeed, she trod the earth lightly, 
                and in her constitution there was little of the robust clay. </p>
              <p>　　She was in striking contrast to Wolf Larsen. Each was nothing 
                that the other was, everything that the other was not. I noted 
                them walking the deck together one morning, and I likened them 
                to the extreme ends of the human ladder of evolution- the one 
                the culmination of all savagery, the other the finished product 
                of the finest civilization. True, Wolf Larsen possessed intellect 
                to an unusual degree, but it was directed solely to the exercise 
                of his savage instincts and made him but the more formidable a 
                savage. He was splendidly muscled, a heavy man, and though he 
                strode with the certitude and directness of the physical man, 
                there was nothing heavy about his stride. The jungle and the wilderness 
                lurked in the lift and downput of his feet. He was cat-footed, 
                lithe, and strong, always strong. I likened him to some great 
                tiger, a beast of prowess and prey. He looked it, and the piercing 
                glitter that arose at times in his eyes was the same piercing 
                glitter I had observed in the eyes of caged leopards and other 
                preying creatures of the wild. </p>
              <p>　　But this day, as I noted them pacing up and down, I saw that 
                it was she who terminated the walk. They came up to where I was 
                standing by the entrance to the companionway. Though she betrayed 
                it by no outward sign, I felt, somehow, that she was greatly perturbed. 
                She made some idle remark, looking at me, and laughed lightly 
                enough, but I saw her eyes return to his, involuntarily, as though 
                fascinated; then they fell, but not swiftly enough to veil the 
                rush of terror that filled them. </p>
              <p>　　It was in his eyes that I saw the cause of her perturbation. 
                Ordinarily gray and cold and harsh, they were now warm and soft 
                and golden, and all adance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded, 
                or welled up till the full orbs were flooded with a flowing radiance. 
                Perhaps it was to this that the golden color was due; but golden 
                his eyes were, enticing and masterful, at the same time luring 
                and compelling, and speaking a demand and clamor of the blood 
                which no woman, much less Maud Brewster, could misunderstand. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Her own terror rushed upon me, and in that moment of fear, 
                the most terrible fear a man can experience, I knew that in inexpressible 
                ways she was dear to me. The knowledge that I loved her rushed 
                upon me with the terror, and with both emotions gripping at my 
                heart and causing my blood at the same time to chill and to leap 
                riotously. I felt myself drawn by a power without me and beyond 
                me, and found my eyes returning against my will to gaze into the 
                eyes of Wolf Larsen. But he had recovered himself. The golden 
                color and the dancing lights were gone. Cold and gray and glittering 
                they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away. </p>
              <p>　　'I am afraid,' she whispered, with a shiver. 'I am so afraid.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I, too, was afraid, and, what of my discovery of how much she 
                meant to me, my mind was in a turmoil; but I succeeded in answering 
                quite calmly: 'All will come right, Miss Brewster. Trust me; it 
                will come right.' </p>
              <p>　　She answered with a grateful little smile that sent my heart 
                pounding, and started to descend the companion-stairs. </p>
              <p>　　For a long while I remained standing where she had left me. 
                There was imperative need to adjust myself, to consider the significance 
                of the changed aspect of things. It had come at last: love had 
                come when I least expected it, and under the most forbidding conditions. 
                Of course my philosophy had always recognized the inevitableness 
                of the love-call sooner or later; but long years of bookish silence 
                had made me inattentive and unprepared. </p>
              <p>　　And now it had come! Maud Brewster! My memory flashed back 
                to that first thin little volume on my desk, and I saw before 
                me, as though in the concrete, the row of thin little volumes 
                on my library shelf. How I had welcomed each of them! Each year 
                one had come from the press, and to me each was the advent of 
                the year. They had voiced a kindred intellect and spirit, and 
                as such I had received them into a camaraderie of the mind; but 
                now their place was in my heart. </p>
              <p>　　My heart? A revulsion of feeling came over me. I seemed to 
                stand outside myself and to look at myself incredulously. Maud 
                Brewster! Humphrey Van Weyden, the 'cold-blooded fish,' the 'emotionless 
                monster,' the 'analytical demon,' of Charley Furuseth's christening, 
                in love! And then, without rhyme or reason, all skeptical, my 
                mind flew back to a small note in a biographical directory, and 
                I said to myself: 'She was born in Cambridge, and she is twenty-seven 
                years old.' And then I said: 'Twenty-seven years old, and still 
                free and fancy-free.' But how did I know she was fancy-free? And 
                the pang of new-born jealousy put all incredulity to flight. There 
                was no doubt about it. I was jealous; therefore I loved. And the 
                woman I loved was Maud Brewster. </p>
              <p>　　I, Humphrey Van Weyden, was in love! And again the doubt assailed 
                me. Not that I was afraid of it, however, or reluctant to meet 
                it. On the contrary, idealist that I was to the most pronounced 
                degree, my philosophy had always recognized and guerdoned love 
                as the greatest thing in the world, the aim and the summit of 
                being, the most exquisite pitch of joy and happiness to which 
                life could thrill, the thing of all things to be hailed and welcomed 
                and taken into the heart. But now that it had come I could not 
                believe. I could not be so fortunate. It was too good, too good 
                to be true. These lines came into my head: </p>
              <p>　　 I wandered all these years among </p>
              <p>　　 A world of women, seeking you. </p>
              <p>　　And then I had ceased seeking. It was not for me, this greatest 
                thing in the world, I had decided. Furuseth was right; I was abnormal, 
                an 'emotionless monster,' a strange bookish creature capable of 
                pleasuring in sensations only of the mind. And though I had been 
                surrounded by women all my days, my appreciation of them had been 
                esthetic and nothing more. I had actually, at times, considered 
                myself outside the pale, a monkish fellow denied the eternal or 
                the passing passions I saw and understood so well in others. And 
                now it had come! Undreamed of and unheralded, it had come. In 
                what would have been no less than an ecstasy, I left my post at 
                the head of the companionway and started along the deck, murmuring 
                to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs. Browning: </p>
              <p>　　 I lived with visions for my company </p>
              <p>　　 Instead of men and women years ago, </p>
              <p>　　 And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know </p>
              <p>　　 A sweeter music than they played to me. </p>
              <p>　　But the sweeter music was playing in my ears, and I was blind 
                and oblivious to all about me. The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen 
                aroused me. </p>
              <p>　　'What the hell are you up to?' he was demanding. </p>
              <p>　　I had strayed forward where the sailors were painting, and 
                I came to myself to find my advancing foot on the verge of overturning 
                a paint-pot. </p>
              <p>　　'Sleepwalking, sunstroke- what?' he barked. </p>
              <p>　　'No; indigestion,' I retorted, and continued my walk as if 
                nothing untoward had occurred. </p>

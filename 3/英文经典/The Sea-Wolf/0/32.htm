<p>　　I AWOKE, OPPRESSED BY A mysterious sensation. There seemed 
                something missing in my environment. But the mystery and oppressiveness 
                vanished after the first few seconds of waking, when I identified 
                the missing something as the wind. I had fallen asleep in that 
                state of nerve tension with which meets the continuous shock of 
                sound or movement, and I had awakened, still tense, bracing myself 
                to meet the pressure of something which no longer bore upon me. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was the first night I had spent under cover in several months, 
                and I lay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets (for 
                once not wet with fog or spray), analyzing, first, the effect 
                produced upon me by the cessation of the wind, and next the joy 
                which was mine from resting on the mattress made by Maud's hands. 
                When I had dressed and opened the door, I heard the waves still 
                lapping on the beach, garrulously attesting the fury of the night. 
                It was a clear day, and the sun was shining. I had slept late, 
                and I stepped outside with sudden energy, bent upon making up 
                lost time, as befitted a dweller on Endeavor Island. </p>
              <p>　　And when outside I stopped short. I believed my eyes without 
                question, and yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed 
                to me. There, on the beach, not fifty feet away, bow on, dismasted, 
                was a black-hulled vessel. Masts and booms, tangled with shrouds, 
                sheets, and rent canvas, were rubbing gently alongside. I could 
                have rubbed my eyes as I looked. There was the home-made galley 
                we had built, the familiar break of the poop, the low yacht-cabin 
                scarcely rising above the rail. It was the Ghost! </p>
              <p>　　What freak of fortune had brought it here- here of all spots? 
                What chance of chances? I looked at the bleak, inaccessible wall 
                at my back, and knew the profundity of despair. Escape was hopeless, 
                out of the question. I thought of Maud, asleep there in the hut 
                we had reared; I remembered her 'good night, Humphrey.' 'My woman, 
                my mate,' went ringing through my brain; but now, alas! it was 
                a knell that sounded. Then everything went black before my eyes. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Possibly it was the fraction of a second, but I had no knowledge 
                of how long an interval had lapsed before I was myself again. 
                There lay the Ghost, bow on to the beach, her splintered bowsprit 
                projecting over the sand, her tangled spars rubbing against her 
                side to the lift of the crooning waves. Something must be done- 
                must be done! </p>
              <p>　　It came upon me suddenly as strange that nothing moved aboard. 
                Wearied from the night of struggle and wreck, all hands were yet 
                asleep, I thought. My next thought was that Maud and I might yet 
                escape. If we could take to the boat and make around the point 
                before any one awoke! I would call her and start. My hand was 
                lifted at her door to knock, when I recollected the smallness 
                of the island. We could never hide ourselves upon it. There was 
                nothing for us but the wide, raw ocean, I thought of our snug 
                little huts, our supplies of meat and oil and moss and firewood, 
                and I knew that we could never survive the wintry sea and the 
                great storms which were to come. </p>
              <p>　　So I stood, with hesitant knuckle, without her door. It was 
                impossible. A wild thought of rushing in and killing her as she 
                slept rose in my mind. And then, in a flash, the better solution 
                came to me. All hands were asleep. Why not creep aboard the Ghost,- 
                well I knew the way to Wolf Larsen's bunk!- and kill him in his 
                sleep? After that- well, we would see. But with him dead there 
                was time and space in which to prepare to do other things; and, 
                besides, whatever new situation arose, it could not possibly be 
                worse than the present one. </p>
              <p>　　My knife was at my hip. I returned to my hut for the shotgun, 
                made sure it was loaded, and went down to the Ghost. With some 
                difficulty, and at the expense of a wetting to the waist, I climbed 
                aboard. The forecastle scuttle was open. I paused to listen for 
                the breathing of the men, but there was no breathing. I almost 
                gasped as the thought came to me: What if the Ghost is deserted? 
                I listened more closely. There was no sound. I cautiously descended 
                the ladder. The place had the empty and musty feel and smell usual 
                to a dwelling no longer inhabited. Everywhere was a thick litter 
                of discarded and ragged garments, old sea-boots, leaky oilskins- 
                all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long voyage. </p>
              <p>　　Abandoned hastily, was my conclusion as I ascended to the deck. 
                Hope was alive again in my breast, and I looked about me with 
                greater coolness. I noted that the boats were missing. The steerage 
                told the same tale as the forecastle. The hunters had packed their 
                belongings with similar haste. The Ghost was deserted! It was 
                Maud's and mine. I thought of the ship's stores and the lazaret 
                beneath the cabin, and the idea came to me of surprising Maud 
                with something nice for breakfast. </p>
              <p>　　The reaction from my fear, and the knowledge that the terrible 
                deed I had come to do was no longer necessary, made me boyish 
                and eager. I went up the steerage companionway two steps at a 
                time, with nothing distinct in my mind except joy and the hope 
                that Maud would sleep on until the surprise breakfast was quite 
                ready for her. As I rounded the galley, a new satisfaction was 
                mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils inside. I 
                sprang up the break of the poop, and saw- Wolf Larsen! What of 
                my impetus and the stunning surprise. I clattered three or four 
                steps along the deck before I could stop myself. He was standing 
                in the companionway, only his head and shoulders visible, staring 
                straight at me. His arms were resting on the half-open slide. 
                He made no movement whatever- simply stood there, staring at me. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I began to tremble. The old stomach-sickness clutched me. I 
                put one hand on the edge of the house to steady myself. My lips 
                seemed suddenly dry, and I moistened them against the need of 
                speech. Nor did I for an instant take my eyes off him. Neither 
                of us spoke. There was something ominous in his silence, his immobility. 
                All my old fear of him returned and my new fear was increased 
                an hundredfold. And still we stood, the pair of us, staring at 
                each other. </p>
              <p>　　I was aware of the demand for action, and, my old helplessness 
                strong upon me, I was waiting for him to take the initiative. 
                Then, as the moments went by, it came to me that the situation 
                was analogous to the one in which I had approached the long-maned 
                bull, my intention of clubbing obscured by fear until it became 
                a desire to make him run. So it was at last impressed upon me 
                that I was there, not to have Wolf Larsen take the initiative, 
                but to take it myself. </p>
              <p>　　I cocked both barrels and leveled the shotgun at him. Had he 
                moved, attempted to drop down the companionway, I know I should 
                have shot him. But he stood motionless and staring as before. 
                And as I faced him, with leveled gun shaking in my hands, I had 
                time to note the worn and haggard appearance of his face. It was 
                as if some strong anxiety had wasted it. The cheeks were sunken, 
                and there was a wearied, puckered expression on the brow; and 
                it seemed to me that his eyes were strange, not only the expression, 
                but the physical seeming, as though the optic nerves and supporting 
                muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs. 
              </p>
              <p>　　All this I saw, and, my brain now working rapidly, I thought 
                a thousand thoughts; and yet I could not pull the triggers. I 
                lowered the gun and stepped to the corner of the cabin, primarily 
                to relieve the tension on my nerves and to make a new start, and 
                incidentally to be closer. Again I raised the gun. He was almost 
                at arm's length. There was no hope for him. I was resolved. There 
                was no possible chance of missing him, no matter how poor my marksmanship. 
                And yet I wrestled with myself and could not pull the triggers. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Well?' he demanded impatiently. </p>
              <p>　　I strove vainly to force my fingers down on the triggers, and 
                vainly I strove to say something. </p>
              <p>　　'Why don't you shoot?' he asked. </p>
              <p>　　I cleared my throat of a huskiness which prevented speech. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Hump,' he said slowly, 'you can't do it. You are not exactly 
                afraid: you are impotent. Your conventional morality is stronger 
                than you. You are the slave to the opinions which have credence 
                among the people you have known and have read about. Their code 
                has been drummed into your head from the time you lisped, and 
                in spite of your philosophy, and of what I have taught you, it 
                won't let you kill an unarmed, unresisting man.' </p>
              <p>　　'I know it,' I said hoarsely. </p>
              <p>　　'And you know that I would kill an unarmed man as readily as 
                I would smoke a cigar,' he went on. 'You know me for what I am, 
                my worth in the world by your standard. You have called me snake, 
                tiger, shark, monster, and Caliban. And yet, you little rag puppet, 
                you little echoing mechanism, you are unable to kill me as you 
                would a snake or a shark, because I have hands, feet, and a body 
                shaped somewhat like yours. Bah! I had hoped better things of 
                you, Hump.' </p>
              <p>　　He stepped out of the companionway and came up to me. </p>
              <p>　　'Put down that gun. I want to ask you some questions. I haven't 
                had a chance to look around yet. What place is this? How is the 
                Ghost lying? How did you get wet? Where's Maud?- I beg your pardon- 
                Miss Brewster; or should I say &quot;Mrs. Van Weyden&quot;?' </p>
              <p>　　I had backed away from him, almost weeping at my inability 
                to shoot him, but not fool enough to put down the gun. I hoped 
                desperately that he might commit some hostile act, attempt to 
                strike me or choke me; for in such way only I knew I could be 
                stirred to shoot. </p>
              <p>　　'This is Endeavor Island,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Never heard of it,' he broke in. </p>
              <p>　　'At least, that's our name for it,' I amended. </p>
              <p>　　'&quot;Our&quot;?' he queried. 'Who's &quot;our&quot;?' </p>
              <p>　　'Miss Brewster and myself. And the Ghost is lying, as you can 
                see for yourself, bow on to the beach.' </p>
              <p>　　'There are seals here,' he said. 'They woke me up with their 
                barking, or I'd be sleeping yet. I heard them when I drove in 
                last night. They were the first warning that I was on a lee shore. 
                It's a rookery, the kind of a thing I've hunted for years. Thanks 
                to my brother Death, I've lighted on a fortune. It's a mint. What's 
                its bearings?' </p>
              <p>　　'Haven't the least idea,' I said. 'But you ought to know quite 
                closely. What were your last observations?' </p>
              <p>　　He smiled, but did not answer. </p>
              <p>　　'Well, where are all hands?' I asked him. 'How does it come 
                that you are alone?' </p>
              <p>　　I was prepared for him again to set aside my question, and 
                was surprised at the readiness of his reply. </p>
              <p>　　'My brother got me inside forty-eight hours, and through no 
                fault of mine. Boarded me in the night, with only the watch on 
                deck. Hunters went back on me. He gave them a bigger lay. Heard 
                him offering it. Did it right before me. Of course the crew gave 
                me the go-by. That was to be expected. All hands went over the 
                side, and there I was, marooned on my own vessel. It was Death's 
                turn, and it's all in the family anyway.' </p>
              <p>　　'But how did you lose the masts?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　'Walk over and examine those lanyards,' he said, pointing to 
                where the mizzen-rigging should have been. </p>
              <p>　　'They have been cut with a knife!' I exclaimed. </p>
              <p>　　'Not quite,' he laughed. 'It was a neater job. Look again.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I looked. The lanyards had been almost severed, with just enough 
                left to hold the shrouds till some severe strain should be put 
                upon them. </p>
              <p>　　'Cooky did that.' He laughed again. 'I know, though I didn't 
                spot him at it. Kind of evened up the score a bit.' </p>
              <p>　　'Good for Mugridge!' I cried. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, that's what I thought when everything went over the side. 
                Only I said it on the other side of my mouth.' </p>
              <p>　　'But what were you doing while all this was going on?' I asked. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'My best, you may be sure, which wasn't much under the circumstances.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I turned to reexamine Thomas Mugridge's work. </p>
              <p>　　'I guess I'll sit down and take the sunshine,' I heard Wolf 
                Larsen saying. </p>
              <p>　　There was a hint, just a slight hint, of physical feebleness 
                in his voice, and it was so strange that I looked quickly at him. 
                His hand was sweeping nervously across his face, as though he 
                were brushing away cobwebs. I was puzzled- the whole thing was 
                so unlike the Wolf Larsen I had known. </p>
              <p>　　'How are your headaches?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　'They still trouble me,' was his answer. 'I think I have one 
                coming on now.' </p>
              <p>　　He slipped down from his sitting posture till he lay on the 
                deck. Then he rolled over on his side, his head resting on the 
                biceps of the underarm, the forearm shielding his eyes from the 
                sun. I stood regarding him wonderingly. </p>
              <p>　　'Now's your chance, Hump,' he said. </p>
              <p>　　'I don't understand,' I lied, for I thoroughly understood. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, nothing,' he added softly, as if he were drowsing; 'only 
                you've got me where you want me.' </p>
              <p>　　'No, I haven't,' I retorted; 'for I want you a few thousand 
                miles away from here.' </p>
              <p>　　He chuckled, and thereafter spoke no more. He did not stir 
                as I passed by him and went down into the cabin. I lifted the 
                trap in the floor, but for some moments gazed dubiously into the 
                darkness of the lazaret beneath. I hesitated to descend. What 
                if his lying down were a ruse? Pretty indeed to be caught there 
                like a rat! I crept softly up the companionway and peeped at him. 
                He was lying as I had left him. Again I went below; but before 
                I dropped into the lazaret I took the precaution of casting down 
                the door in advance. At least there would be no lid to the trap. 
                But it was all needless. I regained the cabin with a store of 
                jams, sea-biscuits, canned meats, and such things,- all I could 
                carry,- and replaced the trap-door. </p>
              <p>　　A peep at Wolf Larsen showed me that he had not moved. A bright 
                thought struck me. I stole into his stateroom and possessed myself 
                of his revolvers. There were no other weapons, though I thoroughly 
                ransacked the three remaining staterooms. To make sure, I returned 
                and went through the steerage and forecastle, and in the galley 
                gathered up all the sharp meat-and vegetable-knives. Then I bethought 
                me of the great yachtsman's knife he always carried, and I came 
                to him and spoke to him, first softly, then loudly. He did not 
                move. I bent over and took it from his pocket. I breathed more 
                freely. He had no arms with which to attack me from a distance, 
                while I, armed, could always forestall him should he attempt to 
                grapple me with his terrible gorilla arms. </p>
              <p>　　Filling a coffeepot and frying pan with part of my plunder, 
                and taking some chinaware from the cabin pantry, I left Wolf Larsen 
                lying in the sun and went ashore. </p>
              <p>　　Maud was still asleep. I blew up the embers (we had not yet 
                arranged a winter kitchen), and quite feverishly cooked the breakfast. 
                Toward the end I heard her moving about within the hut, making 
                her simple toilet. Just as all was ready and the coffee poured, 
                the door opened and she came forth. </p>
              <p>　　'It's not fair of you,' was her greeting. 'You are usurping 
                one of my prerogatives. You know you agreed that the cooking should 
                be mine, and-' </p>
              <p>　　'But just this once,' I pleaded. </p>
              <p>　　'If you promise not to do it again,' she smiled. 'Unless, of 
                course, you have grown tired of my poor efforts.' </p>
              <p>　　To my delight, she never once looked toward the beach, and 
                I maintained the banter with such success that all unconsciously 
                she sipped coffee from the china cup, ate fried evaporated potatoes, 
                and spread marmalade on her biscuit. But it could not last. I 
                saw the surprise that came over her. She had discovered the china 
                plate from which she was eating. She looked over the breakfast, 
                noting detail after detail. Then she looked at me, and her face 
                turned slowly toward the beach. </p>
              <p>　　'Humphrey!' she said. </p>
              <p>　　The old unnamable terror mounted into her eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'Is- he-?' she quavered. </p>
              <p>　　I nodded my head. </p>

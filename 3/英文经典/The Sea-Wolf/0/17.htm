              <p>　　STRANGE TO SAY, IN SPITE of the general foreboding, nothing 
                of especial moment happened on the Ghost. We ran on to the north 
                and west till we raised the coast of Japan and picked up with 
                the great seal herd. Coming from no man knew where in the illimitable 
                Pacific, it was traveling north on its annual migration to the 
                rookeries of Bering Sea. And north we traveled with it, ravaging 
                and destroying, flinging the naked carcasses to the shark, and 
                salting down the skins, so that they might later adorn the fair 
                shoulders of the women of the cities. </p>
              <p>　　It was wanton slaughter, and all for woman's sake. No man ate 
                of the seal-meat or the oil. After a good day's killing I have 
                seen our decks covered with hides and bodies, slippery with fat 
                and blood, the scuppers running red; masts, ropes, and rails splattered 
                high with the sanguinary color; and the men, like butchers plying 
                their trade, naked and red of arm and hand, hard at work with 
                ripping- and flensing-knives, removing the skins from the pretty 
                sea-creatures they had killed. </p>
              <p>　　It was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from 
                the boats, to oversee the skinning, and afterward the cleansing 
                of the decks and bringing things shipshape again. It was not pleasant 
                work,- my soul and my stomach revolted at it,- and yet, in a way, 
                this handling and directing of many men was good for me. It developed 
                what little executive ability I possessed, and I was aware of 
                a toughening or hardening which I was undergoing and which could 
                not be anything but wholesome for 'Sissy' Van Weyden. </p>
              <p>　　One thing I was beginning to feel, and that was that I could 
                never again be quite the same man I had been. While my hope and 
                faith in human life still survived Wolf Larsen's destructive criticism, 
                he had nevertheless been a cause of change in minor matters. He 
                had opened up for me the world of the real, of which I had known 
                virtually nothing, and from which I had always shrunk. I had learned 
                to look more closely at life as it is lived, to recognize that 
                there were such things as facts in the world; to emerge from the 
                realm of mind and idea, and to place certain values on the concrete 
                and objective phases of existence. </p>
              <p>　　I saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the 
                grounds; for when the weather was fair and we were in the midst 
                of the herd, all hands were away in the boats, and left on board 
                were only he and I, and Thomas Mugridge, who did not count. But 
                there was no play about it. The six boats, spreading out fanwise 
                from the schooner until the first weather boat and the last lee 
                boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart, cruised along 
                a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad weather drove 
                them in. It was our duty to sail the Ghost well to leeward of 
                the last lee boat, so that all the boats would have fair wind 
                to run for us in case of squalls for threatening weather. </p>
              <p>　　It is no slight matter for two men, particularly when a stiff 
                wind has sprung up, to handle a vessel like the Ghost, steering, 
                keeping lookout for the boats, and setting or taking in sail, 
                so it devolved upon me to learn, and learn quickly. Steering I 
                picked up easily, but running aloft to the crosstrees, and swinging 
                my whole, weight by my arms when I left the ratlines and climbed 
                still higher, was more difficult. This, too, I learned, and quickly, 
                for I felt somehow a wild desire to vindicate myself in Wolf Larsen's 
                eyes, to prove my right to live in ways other than of the mind. 
                Nay, the time came when I took joy in the run to the masthead, 
                and in the clinging on by my legs at that precarious height while 
                I swept the sea with the glasses in search of the boats. </p>
              <p>　　I remember one beautiful day, when the boats left early and 
                the reports of the hunters' guns grew dim and distant and died 
                away as they scattered far and wide over the sea. There was just 
                the faintest wind from the westward; but it breathed its last 
                by the time we managed to get to leeward of the last lee boat. 
                One by one- I was at the masthead and saw- the six boats disappeared 
                over the bulge of the earth as they followed the seal into the 
                west. We lay, scarcely rolling on the placid sea, unable to follow. 
                Wolf Larsen was apprehensive. The barometer was down, and the 
                sky to the east did not please him. He studied it with unceasing 
                vigilance. </p>
              <p>　　'If she comes out of there,' he said, 'hard and snappy, putting 
                us to windward of the boats, it's likely there'll be empty bunks 
                in steerage and f'c's'le.' </p>
              <p>　　By eleven o'clock the sea had became glass. By midday, though 
                we were well up in the northerly latitudes, the heat was sickening. 
                There was no freshness in the air. It was sultry and oppressive, 
                reminding me of what the old Californians term 'earthquake weather.' 
                There was something ominous about it, and in intangible ways one 
                was made to feel that the worst was about to come. Slowly the 
                whole eastern sky filled with clouds that overtowered us like 
                some black sierra of the infernal regions. So clearly could one 
                see canon, gorge, and precipice, and the shadows that lay therein, 
                that one looked unconsciously for the white surf-line and bellowing 
                caverns where the sea charges forever on the land. And still we 
                rocked gently, and there was no wind. </p>
              <p>　　'It's no squall,' Wolf Larsen said. 'Old Mother Nature's going 
                to get up on her hind legs and howl for all that's in her, and 
                it'll keep up jumping, Hump, to pull through with half our boats. 
                You'd better run up and loosen the topsails.' </p>
              <p>　　'But if it is going to howl, and there are only two of us?' 
                I asked, a note of protest in my voice. </p>
              <p>　　'Why, we've got to make the best of the first of it and run 
                down to our boats before our canvas is ripped out of us. After 
                that I don't give a rap what happens. The sticks'll stand it, 
                and you and I will have to, though we've plenty cut out for us.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Still the calm continued. We ate dinner, a hurried and anxious 
                meal for me, with eighteen men abroad on the sea and beyond the 
                bulge of the earth, and with that heaven-rolling mountain range 
                of clouds moving slowly down upon us. Wolf Larsen did not seem 
                affected, however, though I noticed, when we returned to the deck, 
                a slight twitching of the nostrils, a perceptible quickness of 
                movement. His face was stern, the lines of it had grown hard, 
                and yet in his eyes- blue, clear blue this day- there was a strange 
                brilliancy, a bright, scintillating light. It struck me that he 
                was joyous in a ferocious sort of way; that he was glad there 
                was an impending struggle; that he was thrilled and upborne with 
                knowledge that one of the great moments of living, when the tide 
                of life surges up in flood, was upon him. </p>
              <p>　　Once, and unwitting that he did so or that I saw, he laughed 
                aloud mockingly and defiantly at the advancing storm. I see him 
                yet, standing there like a pygmy out of the 'Arabian Nights' before 
                the huge front of some malignant jinnee. He was daring destiny, 
                and he was unafraid. </p>
              <p>　　He walked to the galley. </p>
              <p>　　'Cooky,' I heard him say, 'by the time you've finished pots 
                and pans you'll be wanted on deck. Stand ready for a call.' </p>
              <p>　　'Hump,' he said, becoming cognizant of the fascinated gaze 
                I bent upon him, 'this beats whiskey, and is where your Omar misses. 
                I think he only half lived, after all.' </p>
              <p>　　The western half of the sky had by now grown murky. The sun 
                had dimmed and faded out of sight. It was two in the afternoon, 
                and a ghostly twilight, shot through by wandering purplish lights, 
                had descended upon us, and Wolf Larsen's face glowed in the purplish 
                light. We lay in the midst of an unearthly quiet, while all about 
                us were signs and omens of oncoming sound and movement. The sultry 
                heat had become unendurable. The sweat was standing on my forehead, 
                and I could feel it trickling down my nose. I felt as though I 
                should faint, and reached out to the rail for support. </p>
              <p>　　And then, just then, the faintest possible whisper of air passed 
                by. It was from the east, and like a whisper it came and went. 
                The drooping canvas was not stirred, and yet my face had felt 
                the air and been cooled. </p>
              <p>　　'Cooky,' Wolf Larsen called in a low voice (Thomas Mugridge 
                turned a pitiable, scared face), 'let go that fore-boom- tackle 
                and pass it across, and when she's willing let go the sheet and 
                come in snug with the tackle. And if you make a mess of it, it 
                will be the last you ever make. Understand?' </p>
              <p>　　'Mr. Van Weyden, stand by to pass the head-sails over. Then 
                jump for the topsails and spread them quick as God'll let you- 
                the quicker you do it, the easier you'll find it. As for Cooky, 
                if he isn't lively, bat him between the eyes.' </p>
              <p>　　I was aware of the compliment and pleased in that no threat 
                had accompanied my instructions. We were lying head to northwest, 
                and it was his intention to jibe over with the first puff. </p>
              <p>　　'We'll have the breeze on our quarter,' he explained to me. 
                'By the last guns the boats were bearing away slightly to the 
                south'ard.' </p>
              <p>　　He turned and walked aft to the wheel. I went forward and took 
                my station at the jibs. Another whisper of wind, and another, 
                passed by. The canvas flapped lazily. </p>
              <p>　　'Thank Gawd she's not comin' all of a bunch, Mr. Van Weyden!' 
                was the Cockney's fervent ejaculation. </p>
              <p>　　And I was indeed thankful, for I had by this time learned enough 
                to know, with all our canvas spread, what disaster in such event 
                awaited us. The whispers of wind became puffs, the sails filled, 
                the Ghost moved. Wolf Larsen put the wheel hard up to port, and 
                we began to pay off. The wind was now dead astern, muttering and 
                puffing stronger and stronger, and my head-sails were pounding 
                lustily. I did not see what went on elsewhere, though I felt the 
                sudden surge and heel of the schooner as the wind-pressures changed 
                to the jibing of the fore-and main-sails. My hands were full with 
                the flying jib, jib, and staysail, and by the time this part of 
                my task was accomplished the Ghost was leaping into the southwest, 
                the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard. Without 
                pausing for breath, though my heart was beating like a trip-hammer 
                from my exertions, I sprang to the topsails, and before the wind 
                had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling 
                down. Then I went aft for orders. </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen nodded approval and relinquished the wheel to me. 
                The wind strengthening steadily and the sea rising for an hour 
                I steered, each moment becoming more difficult. I had not the 
                experience to steer at the gait we were going on a quartering 
                course. </p>
              <p>　　'Now take a run up with the glasses and raise some of the boats. 
                We've made at least ten knots, and we're going twelve or thirteen 
                now. The old girl knows how to walk. Might as well get some of 
                that head-sail off of her,' Larsen added, and turned to Mugridge: 
                'Cooky, run down that flying jib and staysail, and make the downhauls 
                good and fast.' </p>
              <p>　　I contented myself with the fore-crosstrees, some seventy feet 
                above the deck. As I searched the vacant stretch of water before 
                me, I comprehended thoroughly the need for haste if we were to 
                recover any of our men. Indeed, as I gazed at the heavy sea through 
                which we were running, I doubted that there was a boat afloat. 
                It did not seem possible that so frail craft could survive such 
                stress of wind and water. </p>
              <p>　　I could not feel the full force of the wind, for we were running 
                with it, but from my lofty perch I looked down as though outside 
                the Ghost and apart from her, and saw the shape of her outlined 
                sharply against the foaming sea as she tore along instinct with 
                life. Sometimes she would lift and send across some great wave, 
                burying her starboard rail from view and covering her deck to 
                the hatches with the boiling ocean. At such moments, starting 
                from a windward roll, I would go flying through the air with dizzying 
                swiftness, as though I clung to the end of a huge, inverted pendulum, 
                the arc of which, between the greater rolls, must have been seventy 
                feet or more. Once the terror this giddy sweep overpowered me, 
                and for a while I clung on, hand and foot, weak and trembling, 
                unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold aught 
                of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm 
                the Ghost. </p>
              <p>　　But the thought of the men in the midst of it steadied me, 
                and in my quest for them I forgot myself. For an hour I saw nothing 
                but the naked, desolate sea. And then, where a vagrant shaft of 
                sunlight struck the ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver, 
                I caught a small black speck thrust skyward for an instant and 
                swallowed up. I waited patiently. Again the tiny point of black 
                projected itself through the wrathful blaze, a couple of points 
                off our port bow. I did not attempt to shout, but communicated 
                the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm. He changed the course, 
                and I signaled affirmation when the speck showed dead ahead. </p>
              <p>　　It grew larger, and so swiftly that for the first time I fully 
                appreciated the speed of our flight. Wolf Larsen motioned for 
                me to come down, and when I stood beside him at the wheel he gave 
                me instructions for heaving to. </p>
              <p>　　'Expect all hell to break loose,' he cautioned me, 'but don't 
                mind it. Yours is to do your own work and to have Cooky stand 
                by the fore-sheet.' </p>
              <p>　　I managed to make my way forward, but there was little choice 
                of sides, for the weather rail seemed buried as often as the lee. 
                Having instructed Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do, I clambered 
                into the fore rigging a few feet. The boat was now very close, 
                and I could make out plainly that it was lying head to wind and 
                sea and dragging on its mast and sail, which had been thrown overboard 
                and made to serve as a sea-anchor. The three men were bailing. 
                Each rolling mountin whelmed them from view, and I would wait 
                with sickening anxiety, fearing that they would never appear again. 
                Then, and with black suddenness, the boat would shoot clear through 
                the foaming crest, bow pointed to the sky and the whole length 
                of her bottom showing, wet and dark, till she seemed on end. There 
                would be a fleeting glimpse of the three men flinging water in 
                frantic haste, when she would topple over and fall into the yawning 
                valley, bow down and showing her full inside length to the stern 
                upreared almost directly above the bow. Each time that she reappeared 
                was a recurrent miracle. </p>
              <p>　　The Ghost suddenly changed her course, keeping away, and it 
                came to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue 
                as impossible. Then I realized that he was preparing to heave 
                to, and dropped to the deck to be in readiness. We were now dead 
                before the wind, the boat far away and abreast of us. I felt an 
                abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss for the moment of all strain 
                and pressure coupled with a swift acceleration of speed. She was 
                rushing around on her heel into the wind. </p>
              <p>　　As she arrived at right-angles to the sea, the full force of 
                the wind, from which we had hitherto run away, caught us. I was 
                unfortunately and ignorantly facing it. It stood up against me 
                like a wall, filling my lungs with air which I could not expel. 
                And as I choked and strangled, and as the Ghost wallowed for an 
                instant, broadside on and rolling straight over and far into the 
                wind, I beheld a huge sea rise far above my head. I turned aside, 
                caught my breath, and looked again. The wave overtopped the Ghost, 
                and I gazed sheer up and into it. A shaft of sunlight smote the 
                over-curl, and I caught a glimpse of translucent, rushing green, 
                backed by a milky smother of foam. </p>
              <p>　　Then it descended, pandemonium broke loose, everything happened 
                at once. I was struck a crushing, stunning blow, nowhere in particular 
                and yet everywhere. My hold had been broken loose, I was under 
                water, and the thought passed through my mind that this was the 
                terrible thing of which I had heard, the being swept in the trough 
                of the sea. My body struck and pounded as it was dashed helplessly 
                along and turned over and over, and when I could hold my breath 
                no longer I breathed the stinging salt water into my lungs. But 
                through it all I clung to the one idea- I must get the jib backed 
                over to windward. I had no fear of death. I had no doubt but that 
                I should come through somehow. And as this idea of fulfilling 
                Wolf Larsen's order persisted in my dazed consciousness, I seemed 
                to see him standing at the wheel in the midst of the wild welter, 
                pitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I brought up violently against what I took to be the rail, 
                breathed, and breathed the sweet air again. I tried to rise, but 
                struck my head, and was knocked back on hands and knees. By some 
                freak of the waters I had been swept clear under the forecastle 
                head and into the eyes. As I scrambled out on all fours, I passed 
                over the body of Thomas Mugridge, who lay in a groaning heap. 
                There was no time to investigate. I must get the jib backed over. 
              </p>
              <p>　　When I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything 
                had come. On all sides there was a rending and crashing of wood 
                and steel and canvas. The Ghost was being wrenched and torn to 
                fragments. The foresail and foretopsail, emptied of the wind by 
                the maneuver, and with no one to bring in the sheet in time, were 
                thundering into ribbons, the heavy boom thrashing and splintering 
                from rail to rail. The air was thick with flying wreckage, detached 
                ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like snakes, and down 
                through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail. </p>
              <p>　　The spar could not have missed me by many inches, while it 
                spurred me to action. Perhaps the situation was not hopeless. 
                I remembered Wolf Larsen's caution. He had expected 'all hell 
                to break loose,' and here it was. And where was he? I caught sight 
                of him toiling at the mainsheet, heaving it in and flat with his 
                tremendous muscles, the stern of the schooner lifted high in the 
                air, and his body outlined against a white surge of sea sweeping 
                past. All this and more- a whole world of chaos and wreck- in 
                possibly fifteen seconds I had seen and heard and grasped. </p>
              <p>　　I did not stop to see what had become of the small boat, but 
                sprang to the jibsheet. The jib itself was beginning to slap, 
                partly filling and emptying with sharp reports; but with a turn 
                of the sheet, and the application of my whole strength each time 
                it slapped, I slowly backed it. This I know: I did my best. Either 
                the downhauls had been carelessly made fast by Mugridge, or else 
                the pins carried away, for, while I pulled till I burst open the 
                ends of all my fingers, the flying jib and staysail filled and 
                fluttered with the wind, split their cloths apart, and thundered 
                into nothingness. </p>
              <p>　　Still I pulled, holding what I gained each time with a double 
                turn until the next slap gave me more. Then the sheet gave with 
                greater ease, and Wolf Larsen was beside me, heaving in alone 
                while I was busied taking up the slack. </p>
              <p>　　'Make fast,' he shouted, 'and come on!' </p>
              <p>　　As I followed him, I noted that, in spite of wrack and ruin, 
                a rough order obtained. The Ghost was hove to. She was still in 
                working order, and she was still working. Though the rest of her 
                sails were gone, the jib, backed to windward, and the mainsail, 
                hauled down flat, were themselves holding, and holding her bow 
                to the furious sea as well. </p>
              <p>　　I looked for the boat, and, while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles, 
                saw it lift to leeward on a big sea and not a score of feet away. 
                And, so nicely had he made his calculation, we drifted fairly 
                down upon it, so that nothing remained to do but hook the tackles 
                to each end and hoist it aboard. But this was not done so easily 
                as it is written. </p>
              <p>　　In the bow was Kerfoot, Oofty-Oofty in the stern, and Kelly 
                amidships. As we drifted closer, the boat would rise on a wave 
                while we sank in the trough, till, almost straight above me, I 
                could see the heads of the three men craned overside and looking 
                down. Then, the next moment, we would lift and soar upward while 
                they sank far down beneath us. It seemed incredible that the next 
                surge should not crush the Ghost down upon the tiny eggshell. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But, at the right moment, I passed the tackle to the Kanaka, 
                while Wolf Larsen did the same thing forward to Kerfoot. Both 
                tackles were hooked in a trice, and the three men, deftly timing 
                the roll, made a simultaneous leap aboard the schooner. As the 
                Ghost rolled her side out of water, the boat was lifted snugly 
                against her, and before the return roll came we had heaved it 
                in over the side and turned it bottom up on the deck. I noticed 
                blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand. In some way the third 
                finger had been crushed to a pulp. But he gave no sign of pain, 
                and with his single right hand helped us lash the boat in its 
                place. </p>
              <p>　　'Stand by to let that jib over, you Oofty,' Wolf Larsen commanded, 
                the very second we had finished with the boat. 'Kelly, come aft 
                and slack off the mainsheet. You, Kerfoot, go for'ard and see 
                what's become of Cooky. Mr. Van Weyden, run aloft again, and cut 
                away any stray stuff in your way.' </p>
              <p>　　And having commanded, he went aft, with his peculiar tigerish 
                leaps, to the wheel. While I toiled up the fore-shrouds the Ghost 
                slowly paid off. This time, as we went into the trough of the 
                sea and were swept, there were no sails to carry away. And halfway 
                to the crosstrees, and flattened against the rigging by the full 
                force of the wind, so that it would have been impossible for me 
                to have fallen, with the Ghost almost on her beam-ends, and the 
                masts parallel with the water, I looked, not down, but at right 
                angles from the perpendicular, to the deck of the Ghost. But I 
                saw not the deck, but where the deck should have been, for it 
                was buried beneath a wild tumbling of water. Out of this water 
                I could see the two masts rising, and that was all. The Ghost, 
                for the moment, was buried beneath the sea. As she squared off 
                more and more, escaping from the side pressure, she righted herself 
                and broke her deck, like a whale's back, through the ocean surface. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Then we raced, and wildly, across the wild sea, the while I 
                hung like a fly in the crosstrees and searched for the other boats. 
                In half an hour I sighted the second one, swamped and bottom up, 
                to which were desperately clinging Jock Horner, fat Louis, and 
                Johnson. This time I remained aloft, and Wolf Larsen succeeded 
                in heaving to without being swept. As before, we drifted down 
                upon the boat. Tackles were made fast and lines flung to the men, 
                who scrambled aboard like monkeys. The boat itself was crushed 
                and splintered against the schooner's side as it came inboard; 
                but the wreck was securely lashed, for it could be patched and 
                made whole again. </p>
              <p>　　Once more the Ghost bore away before the storm, this time so 
                submerging herself that for some seconds I thought she would never 
                reappear. Even the wheel, quite a deal higher than the waist, 
                was covered and swept again and again. At such moments I felt 
                strangely alone with God, and watching the chaos of his wrath. 
                And then the wheel would reappear, and Wolf Larsen's broad shoulders, 
                his hands gripping the spokes and holding the schooner to the 
                course of his will, himself an earth-god, dominating the storm, 
                flinging its descending waters from him, and riding it to his 
                own ends. And oh, the marvel of it, the marvel of it, that tiny 
                men should live and breathe and work, and drive so frail a contrivance 
                of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife! </p>
              <p>　　As before, the Ghost swung out of the trough, lifting her deck 
                again out of the sea, and dashed before the howling blast. It 
                was now half-past five, and half an hour later, when the last 
                of the day lost itself in a dim and furious twilight, I sighted 
                a third boat. It was bottom up, and there was no sign of its crew. 
                Wolf Larsen repeated his maneuver, holding off and then rounding 
                up to windward and drifting down upon it. But this time he missed 
                by forty feet, the boat passing astern. </p>
              <p>　　'No. 4 boat!' Oofty-Oofty cried, his keen eyes reading its 
                number in the one second when it lifted clear of the foam and 
                upside down. </p>
              <p>　　It was Henderson's boat, and with him had been lost Holyoak 
                and Williams, another of the deep-water crowd. Lost they indubitably 
                were; but the boat remained, and Wolf Larsen made one more reckless 
                effort to recover it. I had come down to the deck, and I saw Horner 
                and Kerfoot vainly protest against the attempt. </p>
              <p>　　'By God, I'll not be robbed of my boat by any storm that ever 
                blew out of hell!' he shouted, and though we four stood with our 
                heads together that we might hear, his voice seemed faint and 
                far, as though removed from us an immense distance. </p>
              <p>　　'Mr. Van Weyden,' he cried, and I heard through the tumult 
                as one might hear a whisper, 'stand by that jib with Johnson and 
                Oofty! The rest of you tail aft to the main-sheet! Lively now, 
                or I'll sail you all into kingdom come! Understand?' </p>
              <p>　　And when he put the wheel hard over and the Ghost's bow swung 
                off, there was nothing for the hunters to do but obey and make 
                the best of a risky chance. How great the risk I realized when 
                I was once more buried beneath the pounding seas and clinging 
                for life to the pin-rail at the foot of the foremast. My fingers 
                were torn loose, and I was swept across to the side and over the 
                side into the sea. I could not swim, but before I could sink I 
                was swept back again. A strong hand gripped me, and when the Ghost 
                finally emerged I found that I owed my life to Johnson. I saw 
                him looking anxiously about him, and noted that Kelly, who had 
                come forward at the last moment, was missing. </p>
              <p>　　This time, having missed the boat, and not being in the same 
                position as in the previous instances, Wolf Larsen was compelled 
                to resort to a different maneuver. Running off before the wind 
                with everything to starboard, he came about and returned close-hauled 
                on the port tack. </p>
              <p>　　'Grand!' Johnson shouted in my ear, as we successfully came 
                through the attendant deluge; and I knew he referred, not to Wolf 
                Larsen's seamanship, but to the performance of the Ghost herself. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was now so dark that there was no sign of the boat; but 
                Wolf Larsen held back through the frightful turmoil as if guided 
                by unerring instinct. This time, though we were continually half-buried, 
                there was no trough in which to be swept, and we drifted squarely 
                down upon the upturned boat, badly smashing it as it was heaved 
                inboard. </p>
              <p>　　Two hours of terrible work followed, in which all hands of 
                us- two hunters, three sailors, Wolf Larsen, and I- reefed, first 
                one and then the other, the jib and mainsail. Hove to under this 
                short canvas, our decks were comparatively free of water, while 
                the Ghost bobbed and ducked among the combers like a cork. </p>
              <p>　　I had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first, 
                and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running 
                down my cheeks. And when all was done, I gave up like a woman 
                and rolled. upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion. </p>
              <p>　　In the meantime, Thomas Mugridge, like a drowned rat, was being 
                dragged out from under the forecastle head, where he had cravenly 
                ensconced himself. I saw him pulled aft to the cabin, and noted 
                with a shock of surprise that the galley had disappeared. A clean 
                space of deck showed where it had stood. </p>
              <p>　　In the cabin I found all hands assembled, sailors as well, 
                and while coffee was being cooked over the small stove we drank 
                whiskey and crunched hardtack. Never in my life had food been 
                so welcome, and never had hot coffee tasted so good. So violently 
                did the Ghost pitch and toss and tumble that it was impossible 
                for even the sailors to move about without holding on, and several 
                times, after a cry of 'Now she takes it!' we were heaped upon 
                the wall of the port cabin as though it had been the deck. </p>
              <p>　　'To- with a lookout,' I heard Wolf Larsen say when we had eaten 
                and drunk our fill. 'There's nothing can be done on deck. If anything's 
                going to run us down, we couldn't get out of its way. Turn in, 
                all hands, and get some sleep.' </p>
              <p>　　The sailors slipped forward, setting the side-lights as they 
                went, while the two hunters remained to sleep in the cabin, it 
                not being deemed advisable to open the slide to the steerage companionway. 
                Wolf Larsen and I, between us, cut off Kerfoot's crushed finger 
                and sewed up the stump. Mugridge, who, during all the time he 
                had been compelled to cook and serve coffee and keep the fire 
                going, had complained of internal pains, now swore that he had 
                a broken rib or two. On examination we found that he had three. 
                But his case was deferred to next day, principally for the reason 
                that I did not know anything about broken ribs, and would first 
                have to read it up. </p>
              <p>　　'I don't think it was worth it,' I said to Wolf Larsen, 'a 
                broken boat for Kelly's life.' </p>
              <p>　　'But Kelly didn't amount to much,' was the reply. 'Good night.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　After all that had passed, suffering intolerable anguish in 
                my finger-ends, and with three boats missing, to say nothing of 
                the wild capers the Ghost was cutting, I would have thought it 
                impossible to sleep. But my eyes must have closed the instant 
                my head touched the pillow, and in utter exhaustion I slept throughout

            <p>　　I replied that I was certain he was; but that I had not known 
              him long myself, though he was a friend of my aunt's. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 'Your aunt is a 
              sweet lady, Master Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　He had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, 
              which was very ugly; and which diverted my attention from the compliment 
              he had paid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and 
              body. </p>
            <p>　　'A sweet lady, Master Copperfield!' said Uriah Heep. 'She has 
              a great admiration for Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I said, 'Yes,' boldly; not that I knew anything about it, Heaven 
              forgive me! </p>
            <p>　　'I hope you have, too, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 'But 
              I am sure you must have.' </p>
            <p>　　'Everybody must have,' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah Heep, 'for that 
              remark! It is so true! Umble as I am, I know it is so true! Oh, 
              thank you, Master Copperfield!' He writhed himself quite off his 
              stool in the excitement of his feelings, and, being off, began to 
              make arrangements for going home. </p>
            <p>　　'Mother will be expecting me,' he said, referring to a pale, 
              inexpressive-faced watch in his pocket, 'and getting uneasy; for 
              though we are very umble, Master Copperfield, we are much attached 
              to one another. If you would come and see us, any afternoon, and 
              take a cup of tea at our lowly dwelling, mother would be as proud 
              of your company as I should be.' </p>
            <p>　　I said I should be glad to come. </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, Master Copperfield,' returned Uriah, putting his 
              book away upon the shelf - 'I suppose you stop here, some time, 
              Master Copperfield?' </p>
            <p>　　I said I was going to be brought up there, I believed, as long 
              as I remained at school. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, indeed!' exclaimed Uriah. 'I should think YOU would come 
              into the business at last, Master Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　I protested that I had no views of that sort, and that no such 
              scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody; but Uriah insisted 
              on blandly replying to all my assurances, 'Oh, yes, Master Copperfield, 
              I should think you would, indeed!' and, 'Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield, 
              I should think you would, certainly!' over and over again. Being, 
              at last, ready to leave the office for the night, he asked me if 
              it would suit my convenience to have the light put out; and on my 
              answering 'Yes,' instantly extinguished it. After shaking hands 
              with me - his hand felt like a fish, in the dark - he opened the 
              door into the street a very little, and crept out, and shut it, 
              leaving me to grope my way back into the house: which cost me some 
              trouble and a fall over his stool. This was the proximate cause, 
              I suppose, of my dreaming about him, for what appeared to me to 
              be half the night; and dreaming, among other things, that he had 
              launched Mr. Peggotty's house on a piratical expedition, with a 
              black flag at the masthead, bearing the inscription 'Tidd's Practice', 
              under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em'ly 
              to the Spanish Main, to be drowned. </p>
            <p>　　I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school 
              next day, and a good deal the better next day, and so shook it off 
              by degrees, that in less than a fortnight I was quite at home, and 
              happy, among my new companions. I was awkward enough in their games, 
              and backward enough in their studies; but custom would improve me 
              in the first respect, I hoped, and hard work in the second. Accordingly, 
              I went to work very hard, both in play and in earnest, and gained 
              great commendation. And, in a very little while, the Murdstone and 
              Grinby life became so strange to me that I hardly believed in it, 
              while my present life grew so familiar, that I seemed to have been 
              leading it a long time. </p>
            <p>　　Doctor Strong's was an excellent school; as different from Mr. 
              Creakle's as good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously 
              ordered, and on a sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to 
              the honour and good faith of the boys, and an avowed intention to 
              rely on their possession of those qualities unless they proved themselves 
              unworthy of it, which worked wonders. We all felt that we had a 
              part in the management of the place, and in sustaining its character 
              and dignity. Hence, we soon became warmly attached to it - I am 
              sure I did for one, and I never knew, in all my time, of any other 
              boy being otherwise - and learnt with a good will, desiring to do 
              it credit. We had noble games out of hours, and plenty of liberty; 
              but even then, as I remember, we were well spoken of in the town, 
              and rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner, to the 
              reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong's boys. </p>
            <p>　　Some of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor's house, and 
              through them I learned, at second hand, some particulars of the 
              Doctor's history - as, how he had not yet been married twelve months 
              to the beautiful young lady I had seen in the study, whom he had 
              married for love; for she had not a sixpence, and had a world of 
              poor relations (so our fellows said) ready to swarm the Doctor out 
              of house and home. Also, how the Doctor's cogitating manner was 
              attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for Greek 
              roots; which, in my innocence and ignorance, I supposed to be a 
              botanical furor on the Doctor's part, especially as he always looked 
              at the ground when he walked about, until I understood that they 
              were roots of words, with a view to a new Dictionary which he had 
              in contemplation. Adams, our head-boy, who had a turn for mathematics, 
              had made a calculation, I was informed, of the time this Dictionary 
              would take in completing, on the Doctor's plan, and at the Doctor's 
              rate of going. He considered that it might be done in one thousand 
              six hundred and forty-nine years, counting from the Doctor's last, 
              or sixty-second, birthday. </p>
            <p>　　But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and 
              it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything 
              else, for he was the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him 
              that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the 
              wall. As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which 
              was at the side of the house, with the stray rooks and jackdaws 
              looking after him with their heads cocked slyly, as if they knew 
              how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he, if any 
              sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes 
              to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress, 
              that vagabond was made for the next two days. It was so notorious 
              in the house, that the masters and head-boys took pains to cut these 
              marauders off at angles, and to get out of windows, and turn them 
              out of the courtyard, before they could make the Doctor aware of 
              their presence; which was sometimes happily effected within a few 
              yards of him, without his knowing anything of the matter, as he 
              jogged to and fro. Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was 
              a very sheep for the shearers. He would have taken his gaiters off 
              his legs, to give away. In fact, there was a story current among 
              us (I have no idea, and never had, on what authority, but I have 
              believed it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true), 
              that on a frosty day, one winter-time, he actually did bestow his 
              gaiters on a beggar-woman, who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood 
              by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door, wrapped in those 
              garments, which were universally recognized, being as well known 
              in the vicinity as the Cathedral. The legend added that the only 
              person who did not identify them was the Doctor himself, who, when 
              they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second-hand 
              shop of no very good repute, where such things were taken in exchange 
              for gin, was more than once observed to handle them approvingly, 
              as if admiring some curious novelty in the pattern, and considering 
              them an improvement on his own. </p>
            <p>　　It was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young 
              wife. He had a fatherly, benignant way of showing his fondness for 
              her, which seemed in itself to express a good man. I often saw them 
              walking in the garden where the peaches were, and I sometimes had 
              a nearer observation of them in the study or the parlour. She appeared 
              to me to take great care of the Doctor, and to like him very much, 
              though I never thought her vitally interested in the Dictionary: 
              some cumbrous fragments of which work the Doctor always carried 
              in his pockets, and in the lining of his hat, and generally seemed 
              to be expounding to her as they walked about. </p>
            <p>　　I saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong, both because she had taken 
              a liking for me on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor, 
              and was always afterwards kind to me, and interested in me; and 
              because she was very fond of Agnes, and was often backwards and 
              forwards at our house. There was a curious constraint between her 
              and Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of whom she seemed to be afraid), 
              that never wore off. When she came there of an evening, she always 
              shrunk from accepting his escort home, and ran away with me instead. 
              And sometimes, as we were running gaily across the Cathedral yard 
              together, expecting to meet nobody, we would meet Mr. Jack Maldon, 
              who was always surprised to see us. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Strong's mama was a lady I took great delight in. Her name 
              was Mrs. Markleham; but our boys used to call her the Old Soldier, 
              on account of her generalship, and the skill with which she marshalled 
              great forces of relations against the Doctor. She was a little, 
              sharp-eyed woman, who used to wear, when she was dressed, one unchangeable 
              cap, ornamented with some artificial flowers, and two artificial 
              butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers. There was 
              a superstition among us that this cap had come from France, and 
              could only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation: 
              but all I certainly know about it, is, that it always made its appearance 
              of an evening, wheresoever Mrs. Markleham made HER appearance; that 
              it was carried about to friendly meetings in a Hindoo basket; that 
              the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly; and that they 
              improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong's expense, like busy 
              bees. </p>
            <p>　　I observed the Old Soldier - not to adopt the name disrespectfully 
              - to pretty good advantage, on a night which is made memorable to 
              me by something else I shall relate. It was the night of a little 
              party at the Doctor's, which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack 
              Maldon's departure for India, whither he was going as a cadet, or 
              something of that kind: Mr. Wickfield having at length arranged 
              the business. It happened to be the Doctor's birthday, too. We had 
              had a holiday, had made presents to him in the morning, had made 
              a speech to him through the head-boy, and had cheered him until 
              we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears. And now, in the evening, 
              Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I, went to have tea with him in his private 
              capacity. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Jack Maldon was there, before us. Mrs. Strong, dressed in 
              white, with cherry-coloured ribbons, was playing the piano, when 
              we went in; and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves. The 
              clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like 
              as usual, I thought, when she turned round; but she looked very 
              pretty, Wonderfully pretty. </p>
            <p>　　'I have forgotten, Doctor,' said Mrs. Strong's mama, when we 
              were seated, 'to pay you the compliments of the day - though they 
              are, as you may suppose, very far from being mere compliments in 
              my case. Allow me to wish you many happy returns.' </p>
            <p>　　'I thank you, ma'am,' replied the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'Many, many, many, happy returns,' said the Old Soldier. 'Not 
              only for your own sake, but for Annie's, and John Maldon's, and 
              many other people's. It seems but yesterday to me, John, when you 
              were a little creature, a head shorter than Master Copperfield, 
              making baby love to Annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the back-garden.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My dear mama,' said Mrs. Strong, 'never mind that now.' </p>
            <p>　　'Annie, don't be absurd,' returned her mother. 'If you are to 
              blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman, when 
              are you not to blush to hear of them?' </p>
            <p>　　'Old?' exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon. 'Annie? Come!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, John,' returned the Soldier. 'Virtually, an old married 
              woman. Although not old by years - for when did you ever hear me 
              say, or who has ever heard me say, that a girl of twenty was old 
              by years! - your cousin is the wife of the Doctor, and, as such, 
              what I have described her. It is well for you, John, that your cousin 
              is the wife of the Doctor. You have found in him an influential 
              and kind friend, who will be kinder yet, I venture to predict, if 
              you deserve it. I have no false pride. I never hesitate to admit, 
              frankly, that there are some members of our family who want a friend. 
              You were one yourself, before your cousin's influence raised up 
              one for you.' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor, in the goodness of his heart, waved his hand as if 
              to make light of it, and save Mr. Jack Maldon from any further reminder. 
              But Mrs. Markleham changed her chair for one next the Doctor's, 
              and putting her fan on his coat-sleeve, said: </p>
            <p>　　'No, really, my dear Doctor, you must excuse me if I appear to 
              dwell on this rather, because I feel so very strongly. I call it 
              quite my monomania, it is such a subject of mine. You are a blessing 
              to us. You really are a Boon, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nonsense, nonsense,' said the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, I beg your pardon,' retorted the Old Soldier. 'With 
              nobody present, but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, 
              I cannot consent to be put down. I shall begin to assert the privileges 
              of a mother-in-law, if you go on like that, and scold you. I am 
              perfectly honest and outspoken. What I am saying, is what I said 
              when you first overpowered me with surprise - you remember how surprised 
              I was? - by proposing for Annie. Not that there was anything so 
              very much out of the way, in the mere fact of the proposal - it 
              would be ridiculous to say that! - but because, you having known 
              her poor father, and having known her from a baby six months old, 
              I hadn't thought of you in such a light at all, or indeed as a marrying 
              man in any way, - simply that, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'Aye, aye,' returned the Doctor, good-humouredly. 'Never mind.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'But I DO mind,' said the Old Soldier, laying her fan upon his 
              lips. 'I mind very much. I recall these things that I may be contradicted 
              if I am wrong. Well! Then I spoke to Annie, and I told her what 
              had happened. I said, &quot;My dear, here's Doctor Strong has positively 
              been and made you the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer.&quot; 
              Did I press it in the least? No. I said, &quot;Now, Annie, tell 
              me the truth this moment; is your heart free?&quot; &quot;Mama,&quot; 
              she said crying, &quot;I am extremely young&quot; - which was perfectly 
              true - &quot;and I hardly know if I have a heart at all.&quot; &quot;Then, 
              my dear,&quot; I said, &quot;you may rely upon it, it's free. At 
              all events, my love,&quot; said I, &quot;Doctor Strong is in an 
              agitated state of mind, and must be answered. He cannot be kept 
              in his present state of suspense.&quot; &quot;Mama,&quot; said Annie, 
              still crying, &quot;would he be unhappy without me? If he would, 
              I honour and respect him so much, that I think I will have him.&quot; 
              So it was settled. And then, and not till then, I said to Annie, 
              &quot;Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he 
              will represent your late father: he will represent the head of our 
              family, he will represent the wisdom and station, and I may say 
              the means, of our family; and will be, in short, a Boon to it.&quot; 
              I used the word at the time, and I have used it again, today. If 
              I have any merit it is consistency.' </p>
            <p>　　The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech, 
              with her eyes fixed on the ground; her cousin standing near her, 
              and looking on the ground too. She now said very softly, in a trembling 
              voice: </p>
            <p>　　'Mama, I hope you have finished?' 'No, my dear Annie,' returned 
              the Old Soldier, 'I have not quite finished. Since you ask me, my 
              love, I reply that I have not. I complain that you really are a 
              little unnatural towards your own family; and, as it is of no use 
              complaining to you. I mean to complain to your husband. Now, my 
              dear Doctor, do look at that silly wife of yours.' </p>
            <p>　　As the Doctor turned his kind face, with its smile of simplicity 
              and gentleness, towards her, she drooped her head more. I noticed 
              that Mr. Wickfield looked at her steadily. </p>
            <p>　　'When I happened to say to that naughty thing, the other day,' 
              pursued her mother, shaking her head and her fan at her, playfully, 
              'that there was a family circumstance she might mention to you - 
              indeed, I think, was bound to mention - she said, that to mention 
              it was to ask a favour; and that, as you were too generous, and 
              as for her to ask was always to have, she wouldn't.' </p>
            <p>　　'Annie, my dear,' said the Doctor. 'That was wrong. It robbed 
              me of a pleasure.' </p>
            <p>　　'Almost the very words I said to her!' exclaimed her mother. 
              'Now really, another time, when I know what she would tell you but 
              for this reason, and won't, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, 
              to tell you myself.' </p>
            <p>　　'I shall be glad if you will,' returned the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'Shall I?' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, then, I will!' said the Old Soldier. 'That's a bargain.' 
              And having, I suppose, carried her point, she tapped the Doctor's 
              hand several times with her fan (which she kissed first), and returned 
              triumphantly to her former station. </p>
            <p>　　Some more company coming in, among whom were the two masters 
              and Adams, the talk became general; and it naturally turned on Mr. 
              Jack Maldon, and his voyage, and the country he was going to, and 
              his various plans and prospects. He was to leave that night, after 
              supper, in a post-chaise, for Gravesend; where the ship, in which 
              he was to make the voyage, lay; and was to be gone - unless he came 
              home on leave, or for his health - I don't know how many years. 
              I recollect it was settled by general consent that India was quite 
              a misrepresented country, and had nothing objectionable in it, but 
              a tiger or two, and a little heat in the warm part of the day. For 
              my own part, I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a modern Sindbad, and 
              pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East, sitting 
              under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes - a mile long, if they 
              could be straightened out. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Strong was a very pretty singer: as I knew, who often heard 
              her singing by herself. But, whether she was afraid of singing before 
              people, or was out of voice that evening, it was certain that she 
              couldn't sing at all. She tried a duet, once, with her cousin Maldon, 
              but could not so much as begin; and afterwards, when she tried to 
              sing by herself, although she began sweetly, her voice died away 
              on a sudden, and left her quite distressed, with her head hanging 
              down over the keys. The good Doctor said she was nervous, and, to 
              relieve her, proposed a round game at cards; of which he knew as 
              much as of the art of playing the trombone. But I remarked that 
              the Old Soldier took him into custody directly, for her partner; 
              and instructed him, as the first preliminary of initiation, to give 
              her all the silver he had in his pocket. </p>
            <p>　　We had a merry game, not made the less merry by the Doctor's 
              mistakes, of which he committed an innumerable quantity, in spite 
              of the watchfulness of the butterflies, and to their great aggravation. 
              Mrs. Strong had declined to play, on the ground of not feeling very 
              well; and her cousin Maldon had excused himself because he had some 
              packing to do. When he had done it, however, he returned, and they 
              sat together, talking, on the sofa. From time to time she came and 
              looked over the Doctor's hand, and told him what to play. She was 
              very pale, as she bent over him, and I thought her finger trembled 
              as she pointed out the cards; but the Doctor was quite happy in 
              her attention, and took no notice of this, if it were so. </p>
            <p>　　At supper, we were hardly so gay. Everyone appeared to feel that 
              a parting of that sort was an awkward thing, and that the nearer 
              it approached, the more awkward it was. Mr. Jack Maldon tried to 
              be very talkative, but was not at his ease, and made matters worse. 
              And they were not improved, as it appeared to me, by the Old Soldier: 
              who continually recalled passages of Mr. Jack Maldon's youth. </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor, however, who felt, I am sure, that he was making 
              everybody happy, was well pleased, and had no suspicion but that 
              we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment. </p>
            <p>　　'Annie, my dear,' said he, looking at his watch, and filling 
              his glass, 'it is past your cousin jack's time, and we must not 
              detain him, since time and tide - both concerned in this case - 
              wait for no man. Mr. Jack Maldon, you have a long voyage, and a 
              strange country, before you; but many men have had both, and many 
              men will have both, to the end of time. The winds you are going 
              to tempt, have wafted thousands upon thousands to fortune, and brought 
              thousands upon thousands happily back.' </p>
            <p>　　'It's an affecting thing,' said Mrs. Markleham - 'however it's 
              viewed, it's affecting, to see a fine young man one has known from 
              an infant, going away to the other end of the world, leaving all 
              he knows behind, and not knowing what's before him. A young man 
              really well deserves constant support and patronage,' looking at 
              the Doctor, 'who makes such sacrifices.' </p>
            <p>　　'Time will go fast with you, Mr. Jack Maldon,' pursued the Doctor, 
              'and fast with all of us. Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, 
              in the natural course of things, to greet you on your return. The 
              next best thing is to hope to do it, and that's my case. I shall 
              not weary you with good advice. You have long had a good model before 
              you, in your cousin Annie. Imitate her virtues as nearly as you 
              can.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Markleham fanned herself, and shook her head. </p>
            <p>　　'Farewell, Mr. Jack,' said the Doctor, standing up; on which 
              we all stood up. 'A prosperous voyage out, a thriving career abroad, 
              and a happy return home!' </p>
            <p>　　We all drank the toast, and all shook hands with Mr. Jack Maldon; 
              after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there, 
              and hurried to the door, where he was received, as he got into the 
              chaise, with a tremendous broadside of cheers discharged by our 
              boys, who had assembled on the lawn for the purpose. Running in 
              among them to swell the ranks, I was very near the chaise when it 
              rolled away; and I had a lively impression made upon me, in the 
              midst of the noise and dust, of having seen Mr. Jack Maldon rattle 
              past with an agitated face, and something cherry-coloured in his 
              hand. </p>
            <p>　　After another broadside for the Doctor, and another for the Doctor's 
              wife, the boys dispersed, and I went back into the house, where 
              I found the guests all standing in a group about the Doctor, discussing 
              how Mr. Jack Maldon had gone away, and how he had borne it, and 
              how he had felt it, and all the rest of it. In the midst of these 
              remarks, Mrs. Markleham cried: 'Where's Annie?' </p>
            <p>　　No Annie was there; and when they called to her, no Annie replied. 
              But all pressing out of the room, in a crowd, to see what was the 
              matter, we found her lying on the hall floor. There was great alarm 
              at first, until it was found that she was in a swoon, and that the 
              swoon was yielding to the usual means of recovery; when the Doctor, 
              who had lifted her head upon his knee, put her curls aside with 
              his hand, and said, looking around: </p>
            <p>　　'Poor Annie! She's so faithful and tender-hearted! It's the parting 
              from her old playfellow and friend - her favourite cousin - that 
              has done this. Ah! It's a pity! I am very sorry!' </p>
            <p>　　When she opened her eyes, and saw where she was, and that we 
              were all standing about her, she arose with assistance: turning 
              her head, as she did so, to lay it on the Doctor's shoulder - or 
              to hide it, I don't know which. We went into the drawing-room, to 
              leave her with the Doctor and her mother; but she said, it seemed, 
              that she was better than she had been since morning, and that she 
              would rather be brought among us; so they brought her in, looking 
              very white and weak, I thought, and sat her on a sofa. </p>
            <p>　　'Annie, my dear,' said her mother, doing something to her dress. 
              'See here! You have lost a bow. Will anybody be so good as find 
              a ribbon; a cherry-coloured ribbon?' </p>
            <p>　　It was the one she had worn at her bosom. We all looked for it; 
              I myself looked everywhere, I am certain - but nobody could find 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　'Do you recollect where you had it last, Annie?' said her mother. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I wondered how I could have thought she looked white, or anything 
              but burning red, when she answered that she had had it safe, a little 
              while ago, she thought, but it was not worth looking for. </p>
            <p>　　Nevertheless, it was looked for again, and still not found. She 
              entreated that there might be no more searching; but it was still 
              sought for, in a desultory way, until she was quite well, and the 
              company took their departure. </p>
            <p>　　We walked very slowly home, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I - Agnes 
              and I admiring the moonlight, and Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising 
              his eyes from the ground. When we, at last, reached our own door, 
              Agnes discovered that she had left her little reticule behind. Delighted 
              to be of any service to her, I ran back to fetch it. </p>
            <p>　　I went into the supper-room where it had been left, which was 
              deserted and dark. But a door of communication between that and 
              the Doctor's study, where there was a light, being open, I passed 
              on there, to say what I wanted, and to get a candle. </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside, and 
              his young wife was on a stool at his feet. The Doctor, with a complacent 
              smile, was reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement 
              of a theory out of that interminable Dictionary, and she was looking 
              up at him. But with such a face as I never saw. It was so beautiful 
              in its form, it was so ashy pale, it was so fixed in its abstraction, 
              it was so full of a wild, sleep-walking, dreamy horror of I don't 
              know what. The eyes were wide open, and her brown hair fell in two 
              rich clusters on her shoulders, and on her white dress, disordered 
              by the want of the lost ribbon. Distinctly as I recollect her look, 
              I cannot say of what it was expressive, I cannot even say of what 
              it is expressive to me now, rising again before my older judgement. 
              Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride, love, and trustfulness - I 
              see them all; and in them all, I see that horror of I don't know 
              what. </p>
            <p>　　My entrance, and my saying what I wanted, roused her. It disturbed 
              the Doctor too, for when I went back to replace the candle I had 
              taken from the table, he was patting her head, in his fatherly way, 
              and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading 
              on; and he would have her go to bed. </p>
            <p>　　But she asked him, in a rapid, urgent manner, to let her stay 
              - to let her feel assured (I heard her murmur some broken words 
              to this effect) that she was in his confidence that night. And, 
              as she turned again towards him, after glancing at me as I left 
              the room and went out at the door, I saw her cross her hands upon 
              his knee, and look up at him with the same face, something quieted, 
              as he resumed his reading. </p>
            <p>　　It made a great impression on me, and I remembered it a long 
              time afterwards; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time 
              comes. </p>

            <p>　　 When the time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously, was 
              within four-and-twenty hours of being come, my aunt and I consulted 
              how we should proceed; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora. 
              Ah! how easily I carried Dora up and down stairs, now! </p>
            <p>　　We were disposed, notwithstanding Mr. Micawber's stipulation 
              for my aunt's attendance, to arrange that she should stay at home, 
              and be represented by Mr. Dick and me. In short, we had resolved 
              to take this course, when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that 
              she never would forgive herself, and never would forgive her bad 
              boy, if my aunt remained behind, on any pretence. </p>
            <p>　　'I won't speak to you,' said Dora, shaking her curls at my aunt. 
              'I'll be disagreeable! I'll make Jip bark at you all day. I shall 
              be sure that you really are a cross old thing, if you don't go!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Tut, Blossom!' laughed my aunt. 'You know you can't do without 
              me!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I can,' said Dora. 'You are no use to me at all. You never 
              run up and down stairs for me, all day long. You never sit and tell 
              me stories about Doady, when his shoes were worn out, and he was 
              covered with dust - oh, what a poor little mite of a fellow! You 
              never do anything at all to please me, do you, dear?' Dora made 
              haste to kiss my aunt, and say, 'Yes, you do! I'm only joking!'- 
              lest my aunt should think she really meant it. </p>
            <p>　　'But, aunt,' said Dora, coaxingly, 'now listen. You must go. 
              I shall tease you, 'till you let me have my own way about it. I 
              shall lead my naughty boy such a life, if he don't make you go. 
              I shall make myself so disagreeable - and so will Jip! You'll wish 
              you had gone, like a good thing, for ever and ever so long, if you 
              don't go. Besides,' said Dora, putting back her hair, and looking 
              wonderingly at my aunt and me, 'why shouldn't you both go? I am 
              not very ill indeed. Am I?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, what a question!' cried my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'What a fancy!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes! I know I am a silly little thing!' said Dora, slowly looking 
              from one of us to the other, and then putting up her pretty lips 
              to kiss us as she lay upon her couch. 'Well, then, you must both 
              go, or I shall not believe you; and then I shall cry!' </p>
            <p>　　I saw, in my aunt's face, that she began to give way now, and 
              Dora brightened again, as she saw it too. </p>
            <p>　　'You'll come back with so much to tell me, that it'll take at 
              least a week to make me understand!' said Dora. 'Because I know 
              I shan't understand, for a length of time, if there's any business 
              in it. And there's sure to be some business in it! If there's anything 
              to add up, besides, I don't know when I shall make it out; and my 
              bad boy will look so miserable all the time. There! Now you'll go, 
              won't you? You'll only be gone one night, and Jip will take care 
              of me while you are gone. Doady will carry me upstairs before you 
              go, and I won't come down again till you come back; and you shall 
              take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me, because she has 
              never been to see us!' </p>
            <p>　　We agreed, without any more consultation, that we would both 
              go, and that Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather 
              unwell, because she liked to be petted. She was greatly pleased, 
              and very merry; and we four, that is to say, my aunt, Mr. Dick, 
              Traddles, and I, went down to Canterbury by the Dover mail that 
              night. </p>
            <p>　　At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him, 
              which we got into, with some trouble, in the middle of the night, 
              I found a letter, importing that he would appear in the morning 
              punctually at half past nine. After which, we went shivering, at 
              that uncomfortable hour, to our respective beds, through various 
              close passages; which smelt as if they had been steeped, for ages, 
              in a solution of soup and stables. </p>
            <p>　　Early in the morning, I sauntered through the dear old tranquil 
              streets, and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways 
              and churches. The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers; 
              and the towers themselves, overlooking many a long unaltered mile 
              of the rich country and its pleasant streams, were cutting the bright 
              morning air, as if there were no such thing as change on earth. 
              Yet the bells, when they sounded, told me sorrowfully of change 
              in everything; told me of their own age, and my pretty Dora's youth; 
              and of the many, never old, who had lived and loved and died, while 
              the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour 
              of the Black Prince hanging up within, and, motes upon the deep 
              of Time, had lost themselves in air, as circles do in water. </p>
            <p>　　I looked at the old house from the corner of the street, but 
              did not go nearer to it, lest, being observed, I might unwittingly 
              do any harm to the design I had come to aid. The early sun was striking 
              edgewise on its gables and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; 
              and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart. </p>
            <p>　　I strolled into the country for an hour or so, and then returned 
              by the main street, which in the interval had shaken off its last 
              night's sleep. Among those who were stirring in the shops, I saw 
              my ancient enemy the butcher, now advanced to top-boots and a baby, 
              and in business for himself. He was nursing the baby, and appeared 
              to be a benignant member of society. </p>
            <p>　　We all became very anxious and impatient, when we sat down to 
              breakfast. As it approached nearer and nearer to half past nine 
              o'clock, our restless expectation of Mr. Micawber increased. At 
              last we made no more pretence of attending to the meal, which, except 
              with Mr. Dick, had been a mere form from the first; but my aunt 
              walked up and down the room, Traddles sat upon the sofa affecting 
              to read the paper with his eyes on the ceiling; and I looked out 
              of the window to give early notice of Mr. Micawber's coming. Nor 
              had I long to watch, for, at the first chime of the half hour, he 
              appeared in the street. </p>
            <p>　　'Here he is,' said I, 'and not in his legal attire!' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt tied the strings of her bonnet (she had come down to 
              breakfast in it), and put on her shawl, as if she were ready for 
              anything that was resolute and uncompromising. Traddles buttoned 
              his coat with a determined air. Mr. Dick, disturbed by these formidable 
              appearances, but feeling it necessary to imitate them, pulled his 
              hat, with both hands, as firmly over his ears as he possibly could; 
              and instantly took it off again, to welcome Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'Gentlemen, and madam,' said Mr. Micawber, 'good morning! My 
              dear sir,' to Mr. Dick, who shook hands with him violently, 'you 
              are extremely good.' </p>
            <p>　　'Have you breakfasted?' said Mr. Dick. 'Have a chop!' </p>
            <p>　　'Not for the world, my good sir!' cried Mr. Micawber, stopping 
              him on his way to the bell; 'appetite and myself, Mr. Dixon, have 
              long been strangers.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dixon was so well pleased with his new name, and appeared 
              to think it so obliging in Mr. Micawber to confer it upon him, that 
              he shook hands with him again, and laughed rather childishly. </p>
            <p>　　'Dick,' said my aunt, 'attention!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick recovered himself, with a blush. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, sir,' said my aunt to Mr. Micawber, as she put on her gloves, 
              'we are ready for Mount Vesuvius, or anything else, as soon as YOU 
              please.' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'I trust you will shortly witness 
              an eruption. Mr. Traddles, I have your permission, I believe, to 
              mention here that we have been in communication together?' </p>
            <p>　　'It is undoubtedly the fact, Copperfield,' said Traddles, to 
              whom I looked in surprise. 'Mr. Micawber has consulted me in reference 
              to what he has in contemplation; and I have advised him to the best 
              of my judgement.' </p>
            <p>　　'Unless I deceive myself, Mr. Traddles,' pursued Mr. Micawber, 
              'what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature.' </p>
            <p>　　'Highly so,' said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps, under such circumstances, madam and gentlemen,' said 
              Mr. Micawber, 'you will do me the favour to submit yourselves, for 
              the moment, to the direction of one who, however unworthy to be 
              regarded in any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore 
              of human nature, is still your fellow-man, though crushed out of 
              his original form by individual errors, and the accumulative force 
              of a combination of circumstances?' </p>
            <p>　　'We have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Micawber,' said I, 'and 
              will do what you please.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'your confidence is 
              not, at the existing juncture, ill-bestowed. I would beg to be allowed 
              a start of five minutes by the clock; and then to receive the present 
              company, inquiring for Miss Wickfield, at the office of Wickfield 
              and Heep, whose Stipendiary I am.' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt and I looked at Traddles, who nodded his approval. </p>
            <p>　　'I have no more,' observed Mr. Micawber, 'to say at present.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　With which, to my infinite surprise, he included us all in a 
              comprehensive bow, and disappeared; his manner being extremely distant, 
              and his face extremely pale. </p>
            <p>　　Traddles only smiled, and shook his head (with his hair standing 
              upright on the top of it), when I looked to him for an explanation; 
              so I took out my watch, and, as a last resource, counted off the 
              five minutes. My aunt, with her own watch in her hand, did the like. 
              When the time was expired, Traddles gave her his arm; and we all 
              went out together to the old house, without saying one word on the 
              way. </p>
            <p>　　We found Mr. Micawber at his desk, in the turret office on the 
              ground floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard. The 
              large office-ruler was stuck into his waistcoat, and was not so 
              well concealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded 
              from his bosom, like a new kind of shirt-frill. </p>
            <p>　　As it appeared to me that I was expected to speak, I said aloud: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'How do you do, Mr. Micawber?' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, gravely, 'I hope I see 
              you well?' </p>
            <p>　　'Is Miss Wickfield at home?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of a rheumatic fever,' 
              he returned; 'but Miss Wickfield, I have no doubt, will be happy 
              to see old friends. Will you walk in, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　He preceded us to the dining-room - the first room I had entered 
              in that house - and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield's former 
              office, said, in a sonorous voice: </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Trotwood, Mr. David Copperfield, Mr. Thomas Traddles, and 
              Mr. Dixon!' </p>
            <p>　　I had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow. Our visit 
              astonished him, evidently; not the less, I dare say, because it 
              astonished ourselves. He did not gather his eyebrows together, for 
              he had none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that 
              he almost closed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his 
              grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. This 
              was only when we were in the act of entering his room, and when 
              I caught a glance at him over my aunt's shoulder. A moment afterwards, 
              he was as fawning and as humble as ever. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, I am sure,' he said. 'This is indeed an unexpected pleasure! 
              To have, as I may say, all friends round St. Paul's at once, is 
              a treat unlooked for! Mr. Copperfield, I hope I see you well, and 
              - if I may umbly express myself so - friendly towards them as is 
              ever your friends, whether or not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope 
              she's getting on. We have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts 
              we have had of her state, lately, I do assure you.' </p>
            <p>　　I felt ashamed to let him take my hand, but I did not know yet 
              what else to do. </p>
            <p>　　'Things are changed in this office, Miss Trotwood, since I was 
              an umble clerk, and held your pony; ain't they?' said Uriah, with 
              his sickliest smile. 'But I am not changed, Miss Trotwood.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' returned my aunt, 'to tell you the truth, I think 
              you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth; if that's 
              any satisfaction to you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, Miss Trotwood,' said Uriah, writhing in his ungainly 
              manner, 'for your good opinion! Micawber, tell 'em to let Miss Agnes 
              know - and mother. Mother will be quite in a state, when she sees 
              the present company!' said Uriah, setting chairs. </p>
            <p>　　'You are not busy, Mr. Heep?' said Traddles, whose eye the cunning 
              red eye accidentally caught, as it at once scrutinized and evaded 
              us. </p>
            <p>　　'No, Mr. Traddles,' replied Uriah, resuming his official seat, 
              and squeezing his bony hands, laid palm to palm between his bony 
              knees. 'Not so much so as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and 
              leeches, are not easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself 
              and Micawber have our hands pretty full, in general, on account 
              of Mr. Wickfield's being hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But 
              it's a pleasure as well as a duty, I am sure, to work for him. You've 
              not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe 
              I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield,' returned Traddles; 
              'or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago, Mr. Heep.' </p>
            <p>　　There was something in the tone of this reply, which made Uriah 
              look at the speaker again, with a very sinister and suspicious expression. 
              But, seeing only Traddles, with his good-natured face, simple manner, 
              and hair on end, he dismissed it as he replied, with a jerk of his 
              whole body, but especially his throat: </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry for that, Mr. Traddles. You would have admired him 
              as much as we all do. His little failings would only have endeared 
              him to you the more. But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner 
              eloquently spoken of, I should refer you to Copperfield. The family 
              is a subject he's very strong upon, if you never heard him.' </p>
            <p>　　I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment (if I should 
              have done so, in any case), by the entrance of Agnes, now ushered 
              in by Mr. Micawber. She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, 
              I thought; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue. But 
              her earnest cordiality, and her quiet beauty, shone with the gentler 
              lustre for it. </p>
            <p>　　I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us; and he reminded me 
              of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit. In the meanwhile, 
              some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, 
              unobserved except by me, went out. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't wait, Micawber,' said Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, with his hand upon the ruler in his breast, stood 
              erect before the door, most unmistakably contemplating one of his 
              fellow-men, and that man his employer. </p>
            <p>　　'What are you waiting for?' said Uriah. 'Micawber! did you hear 
              me tell you not to wait?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes!' replied the immovable Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'Then why DO you wait?' said Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　'Because I - in short, choose,' replied Mr. Micawber, with a 
              burst. </p>
            <p>　　Uriah's cheeks lost colour, and an unwholesome paleness, still 
              faintly tinged by his pervading red, overspread them. He looked 
              at Mr. Micawber attentively, with his whole face breathing short 
              and quick in every feature. </p>
            <p>　　'You are a dissipated fellow, as all the world knows,' he said, 
              with an effort at a smile, 'and I am afraid you'll oblige me to 
              get rid of you. Go along! I'll talk to you presently.' </p>
            <p>　　'If there is a scoundrel on this earth,' said Mr. Micawber, suddenly 
              breaking out again with the utmost vehemence, 'with whom I have 
              already talked too much, that scoundrel's name is - HEEP!' </p>
            <p>　　Uriah fell back, as if he had been struck or stung. Looking slowly 
              round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his 
              face could wear, he said, in a lower voice: </p>
            <p>　　'Oho! This is a conspiracy! You have met here by appointment! 
              You are playing Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield? Now, 
              take care. You'll make nothing of this. We understand each other, 
              you and me. There's no love between us. You were always a puppy 
              with a proud stomach, from your first coming here; and you envy 
              me my rise, do you? None of your plots against me; I'll counterplot 
              you! Micawber, you be off. I'll talk to you presently.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber,' said I, 'there is a sudden change in this fellow. 
              in more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the 
              truth in one particular, which assures me that he is brought to 
              bay. Deal with him as he deserves!' </p>
            <p>　　'You are a precious set of people, ain't you?' said Uriah, in 
              the same low voice, and breaking out into a clammy heat, which he 
              wiped from his forehead, with his long lean hand, 'to buy over my 
              clerk, who is the very scum of society, - as you yourself were, 
              Copperfield, you know it, before anyone had charity on you, - to 
              defame me with his lies? Miss Trotwood, you had better stop this; 
              or I'll stop your husband shorter than will be pleasant to you. 
              I won't know your story professionally, for nothing, old lady! Miss 
              Wickfield, if you have any love for your father, you had better 
              not join that gang. I'll ruin him, if you do. Now, come! I have 
              got some of you under the harrow. Think twice, before it goes over 
              you. Think twice, you, Micawber, if you don't want to be crushed. 
              I recommend you to take yourself off, and be talked to presently, 
              you fool! while there's time to retreat. Where's mother?' he said, 
              suddenly appearing to notice, with alarm, the absence of Traddles, 
              and pulling down the bell-rope. 'Fine doings in a person's own house!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Heep is here, sir,' said Traddles, returning with that 
              worthy mother of a worthy son. 'I have taken the liberty of making 
              myself known to her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Who are you to make yourself known?' retorted Uriah. 'And what 
              do you want here?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am the agent and friend of Mr. Wickfield, sir,' said Traddles, 
              in a composed and business-like way. 'And I have a power of attorney 
              from him in my pocket, to act for him in all matters.' </p>
            <p>　　'The old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage,' said 
              Uriah, turning uglier than before, 'and it has been got from him 
              by fraud!' </p>
            <p>　　'Something has been got from him by fraud, I know,' returned 
              Traddles quietly; 'and so do you, Mr. Heep. We will refer that question, 
              if you please, to Mr. Micawber.' </p>
            <p>　　'Ury -!' Mrs. Heep began, with an anxious gesture. </p>
            <p>　　'YOU hold your tongue, mother,' he returned; 'least said, soonest 
              mended.' </p>
            <p>　　'But, my Ury -' </p>
            <p>　　'Will you hold your tongue, mother, and leave it to me?' </p>
            <p>　　Though I had long known that his servility was false, and all 
              his pretences knavish and hollow, I had had no adequate conception 
              of the extent of his hypocrisy, until I now saw him with his mask 
              off. The suddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived 
              that it was useless to him; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he 
              revealed; the leer with which he exulted, even at this moment, in 
              the evil he had done - all this time being desperate too, and at 
              his wits' end for the means of getting the better of us - though 
              perfectly consistent with the experience I had of him, at first 
              took even me by surprise, who had known him so long, and disliked 
              him so heartily. </p>
            <p>　　I say nothing of the look he conferred on me, as he stood eyeing 
              us, one after another; for I had always understood that he hated 
              me, and I remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek. But when 
              his eyes passed on to Agnes, and I saw the rage with which he felt 
              his power over her slipping away, and the exhibition, in their disappointment, 
              of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues 
              he could never appreciate or care for, I was shocked by the mere 
              thought of her having lived, an hour, within sight of such a man. 
            </p>
            <p>　　After some rubbing of the lower part of his face, and some looking 
              at us with those bad eyes, over his grisly fingers, he made one 
              more address to me, half whining, and half abusive. </p>
            <p>　　'You think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride 
              yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it, to sneak 
              about my place, eaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been ME, 
              I shouldn't have wondered; for I don't make myself out a gentleman 
              (though I never was in the streets either, as you were, according 
              to Micawber), but being you! - And you're not afraid of doing this, 
              either? You don't think at all of what I shall do, in return; or 
              of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy and so forth? Very 
              well. We shall see! Mr. What's-your-name, you were going to refer 
              some question to Micawber. There's your referee. Why don't you make 
              him speak? He has learnt his lesson, I see.' </p>
            <p>　　Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us, he 
              sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets, and 
              one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg, waiting doggedly 
              for what might follow. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with 
              the greatest difficulty, and who had repeatedly interposed with 
              the first syllable Of SCOUN-drel! without getting to the second, 
              now burst forward, drew the ruler from his breast (apparently as 
              a defensive weapon), and produced from his pocket a foolscap document, 
              folded in the form of a large letter. Opening this packet, with 
              his old flourish, and glancing at the contents, as if he cherished 
              an artistic admiration of their style of composition, he began to 
              read as follows: </p>
            <p>　　 '&quot;Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen -&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'Bless and save the man!' exclaimed my aunt in a low voice. 'He'd 
              write letters by the ream, if it was a capital offence!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;In appearing before you to denounce probably the most 
              consummate Villain that has ever existed,&quot;' Mr. Micawber, without 
              looking off the letter, pointed the ruler, like a ghostly truncheon, 
              at Uriah Heep, '&quot;I ask no consideration for myself. The victim, 
              from my cradle, of pecuniary liabilities to which I have been unable 
              to respond, I have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances. 
              Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, have, collectively or separately, 
              been the attendants of my career.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　The relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself as a prey 
              to these dismal calamities, was only to be equalled by the emphasis 
              with which he read his letter; and the kind of homage he rendered 
              to it with a roll of his head, when he thought he had hit a sentence 
              very hard indeed. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;In an accumulation of Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, 
              I entered the office - or, as our lively neighbour the Gaul would 
              term it, the Bureau - of the Firm, nominally conducted under the 
              appellation of Wickfield and - HEEP, but in reality, wielded by 
              - HEEP alone. HEEP, and only HEEP, is the mainspring of that machine. 
              HEEP, and only HEEP, is the Forger and the Cheat.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Uriah, more blue than white at these words, made a dart at the 
              letter, as if to tear it in pieces. Mr. Micawber, with a perfect 
              miracle of dexterity or luck, caught his advancing knuckles with 
              the ruler, and disabled his right hand. It dropped at the wrist, 
              as if it were broken. The blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'The Devil take you!' said Uriah, writhing in a new way with 
              pain. 'I'll be even with you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Approach me again, you - you - you HEEP of infamy,' gasped Mr. 
              Micawber, 'and if your head is human, I'll break it. Come on, come 
              on! ' </p>

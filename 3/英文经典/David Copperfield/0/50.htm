            <div align="center"><b>I AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY </b> </div>
            <p>　　 I received one morning by the post, the following letter, dated 
              Canterbury, and addressed to me at Doctor's Commons; which I read 
              with some surprise: </p>
            <p>　　 'MY DEAR SIR, </p>
            <p>　　'Circumstances beyond my individual control have, for a considerable 
              lapse of time, effected a severance of that intimacy which, in the 
              limited opportunities conceded to me in the midst of my professional 
              duties, of contemplating the scenes and events of the past, tinged 
              by the prismatic hues of memory, has ever afforded me, as it ever 
              must continue to afford, gratifying emotions of no common description. 
              This fact, my dear sir, combined with the distinguished elevation 
              to which your talents have raised you, deters me from presuming 
              to aspire to the liberty of addressing the companion of my youth, 
              by the familiar appellation of Copperfield! It is sufficient to 
              know that the name to which I do myself the honour to refer, will 
              ever be treasured among the muniments of our house (I allude to 
              the archives connected with our former lodgers, preserved by Mrs. 
              Micawber), with sentiments of personal esteem amounting to affection. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'It is not for one, situated, through his original errors and 
              a fortuitous combination of unpropitious events, as is the foundered 
              Bark (if he may be allowed to assume so maritime a denomination), 
              who now takes up the pen to address you - it is not, I repeat, for 
              one so circumstanced, to adopt the language of compliment, or of 
              congratulation. That he leaves to abler and to purer hands. </p>
            <p>　　'If your more important avocations should admit of your ever 
              tracing these imperfect characters thus far - which may be, or may 
              not be, as circumstances arise - you will naturally inquire by what 
              object am I influenced, then, in inditing the present missive? Allow 
              me to say that I fully defer to the reasonable character of that 
              inquiry, and proceed to develop it; premising that it is not an 
              object of a pecuniary nature. </p>
            <p>　　'Without more directly referring to any latent ability that may 
              possibly exist on my part, of wielding the thunderbolt, or directing 
              the devouring and avenging flame in any quarter, I may be permitted 
              to observe, in passing, that my brightest visions are for ever dispelled 
              - that my peace is shattered and my power of enjoyment destroyed 
              - that my heart is no longer in the right place - and that I no 
              more walk erect before my fellow man. The canker is in the flower. 
              The cup is bitter to the brim. The worm is at his work, and will 
              soon dispose of his victim. The sooner the better. But I will not 
              digress. 'Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness, beyond 
              the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber's influence, though exercised 
              in the tripartite character of woman, wife, and mother, it is my 
              intention to fly from myself for a short period, and devote a respite 
              of eight-and-forty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes 
              of past enjoyment. Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and 
              peace of mind, my feet will naturally tend towards the King's Bench 
              Prison. In stating that I shall be (D. V.) on the outside of the 
              south wall of that place of incarceration on civil process, the 
              day after tomorrow, at seven in the evening, precisely, my object 
              in this epistolary communication is accomplished. </p>
            <p>　　'I do not feel warranted in soliciting my former friend Mr. Copperfield, 
              or my former friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple, if 
              that gentleman is still existent and forthcoming, to condescend 
              to meet me, and renew (so far as may be) our past relations of the 
              olden time. I confine myself to throwing out the observation, that, 
              at the hour and place I have indicated, may be found such ruined 
              vestiges as yet 'Remain, 'Of 'A 'Fallen Tower, 'WILKINS MICAWBER. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'P.S. It may be advisable to superadd to the above, the statement 
              that Mrs. Micawber is not in confidential possession of my intentions.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　 I read the letter over several times. Making due allowance for 
              Mr. Micawber's lofty style of composition, and for the extraordinary 
              relish with which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible 
              and impossible occasions, I still believed that something important 
              lay hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication. I put 
              it down, to think about it; and took it up again, to read it once 
              more; and was still pursuing it, when Traddles found me in the height 
              of my perplexity. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear fellow,' said I, 'I never was better pleased to see 
              you. You come to give me the benefit of your sober judgement at 
              a most opportune time. I have received a very singular letter, Traddles, 
              from Mr. Micawber.' </p>
            <p>　　'No?' cried Traddles. 'You don't say so? And I have received 
              one from Mrs. Micawber!' </p>
            <p>　　With that, Traddles, who was flushed with walking, and whose 
              hair, under the combined effects of exercise and excitement, stood 
              on end as if he saw a cheerful ghost, produced his letter and made 
              an exchange with me. I watched him into the heart of Mr. Micawber's 
              letter, and returned the elevation of eyebrows with which he said 
              &quot;'Wielding the thunderbolt, or directing the devouring and 
              avenging flame!&quot; Bless me, Copperfield!'- and then entered 
              on the perusal of Mrs. Micawber's epistle. </p>
            <p>　　It ran thus: </p>
            <p>　　 'My best regards to Mr. Thomas Traddles, and if he should still 
              remember one who formerly had the happiness of being well acquainted 
              with him, may I beg a few moments of his leisure time? I assure 
              Mr. T. T. that I would not intrude upon his kindness, were I in 
              any other position than on the confines of distraction. </p>
            <p>　　'Though harrowing to myself to mention, the alienation of Mr. 
              Micawber (formerly so domesticated) from his wife and family, is 
              the cause of my addressing my unhappy appeal to Mr. Traddles, and 
              soliciting his best indulgence. Mr. T. can form no adequate idea 
              of the change in Mr. Micawber's conduct, of his wildness, of his 
              violence. It has gradually augmented, until it assumes the appearance 
              of aberration of intellect. Scarcely a day passes, I assure Mr. 
              Traddles, on which some paroxysm does not take place. Mr. T. will 
              not require me to depict my feelings, when I inform him that I have 
              become accustomed to hear Mr. Micawber assert that he has sold himself 
              to the D. Mystery and secrecy have long been his principal characteristic, 
              have long replaced unlimited confidence. The slightest provocation, 
              even being asked if there is anything he would prefer for dinner, 
              causes him to express a wish for a separation. Last night, on being 
              childishly solicited for twopence, to buy 'lemon-stunners' - a local 
              sweetmeat - he presented an oyster-knife at the twins! </p>
            <p>　　'I entreat Mr. Traddles to bear with me in entering into these 
              details. Without them, Mr. T. would indeed find it difficult to 
              form the faintest conception of my heart-rending situation. </p>
            <p>　　'May I now venture to confide to Mr. T. the purport of my letter? 
              Will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly consideration? 
              Oh yes, for I know his heart! </p>
            <p>　　'The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded, when of the 
              female sex. Mr. Micawber is going to London. Though he studiously 
              concealed his hand, this morning before breakfast, in writing the 
              direction-card which he attached to the little brown valise of happier 
              days, the eagle-glance of matrimonial anxiety detected, d, o, n, 
              distinctly traced. The West-End destination of the coach, is the 
              Golden Cross. Dare I fervently implore Mr. T. to see my misguided 
              husband, and to reason with him? Dare I ask Mr. T. to endeavour 
              to step in between Mr. Micawber and his agonized family? Oh no, 
              for that would be too much! </p>
            <p>　　'If Mr. Copperfield should yet remember one unknown to fame, 
              will Mr. T. take charge of my unalterable regards and similar entreaties? 
              In any case, he will have the benevolence to consider this communication 
              strictly private, and on no account whatever to be alluded to, however 
              distantly, in the presence of Mr. Micawber. If Mr. T. should ever 
              reply to it (which I cannot but feel to be most improbable), a letter 
              addressed to M. E., Post Office, Canterbury, will be fraught with 
              less painful consequences than any addressed immediately to one, 
              who subscribes herself, in extreme distress, </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Thomas Traddles's respectful friend and suppliant, </p>
            <p>　　 'EMMA MICAWBER.' </p>
            <p>　　 'What do you think of that letter?' said Traddles, casting his 
              eyes upon me, when I had read it twice. 'What do you think of the 
              other?' said I. For he was still reading it with knitted brows. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I think that the two together, Copperfield,' replied Traddles, 
              'mean more than Mr. and Mrs. Micawber usually mean in their correspondence 
              - but I don't know what. They are both written in good faith, I 
              have no doubt, and without any collusion. Poor thing!' he was now 
              alluding to Mrs. Micawber's letter, and we were standing side by 
              side comparing the two; 'it will be a charity to write to her, at 
              all events, and tell her that we will not fail to see Mr. Micawber.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I acceded to this the more readily, because I now reproached 
              myself with having treated her former letter rather lightly. It 
              had set me thinking a good deal at the time, as I have mentioned 
              in its place; but my absorption in my own affairs, my experience 
              of the family, and my hearing nothing more, had gradually ended 
              in my dismissing the subject. I had often thought of the Micawbers, 
              but chiefly to wonder what 'pecuniary liabilities' they were establishing 
              in Canterbury, and to recall how shy Mr. Micawber was of me when 
              he became clerk to Uriah Heep. </p>
            <p>　　However, I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber, in 
              our joint names, and we both signed it. As we walked into town to 
              post it, Traddles and I held a long conference, and launched into 
              a number of speculations, which I need not repeat. We took my aunt 
              into our counsels in the afternoon; but our only decided conclusion 
              was, that we would be very punctual in keeping Mr. Micawber's appointment. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Although we appeared at the stipulated place a quarter of an 
              hour before the time, we found Mr. Micawber already there. He was 
              standing with his arms folded, over against the wall, looking at 
              the spikes on the top, with a sentimental expression, as if they 
              were the interlacing boughs of trees that had shaded him in his 
              youth. </p>
            <p>　　When we accosted him, his manner was something more confused, 
              and something less genteel, than of yore. He had relinquished his 
              legal suit of black for the purposes of this excursion, and wore 
              the old surtout and tights, but not quite with the old air. He gradually 
              picked up more and more of it as we conversed with him; but, his 
              very eye-glass seemed to hang less easily, and his shirt-collar, 
              though still of the old formidable dimensions, rather drooped. </p>
            <p>　　'Gentlemen!' said Mr. Micawber, after the first salutations, 
              'you are friends in need, and friends indeed. Allow me to offer 
              my inquiries with reference to the physical welfare of Mrs. Copperfield 
              in esse, and Mrs. Traddles in posse, - presuming, that is to say, 
              that my friend Mr. Traddles is not yet united to the object of his 
              affections, for weal and for woe.' </p>
            <p>　　We acknowledged his politeness, and made suitable replies. He 
              then directed our attention to the wall, and was beginning, 'I assure 
              you, gentlemen,' when I ventured to object to that ceremonious form 
              of address, and to beg that he would speak to us in the old way. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' he returned, pressing my hand, 'your cordiality 
              overpowers me. This reception of a shattered fragment of the Temple 
              once called Man - if I may be permitted so to express myself - bespeaks 
              a heart that is an honour to our common nature. I was about to observe 
              that I again behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours 
              of my existence fleeted by.' </p>
            <p>　　'Made so, I am sure, by Mrs. Micawber,' said I. 'I hope she is 
              well?' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you,' returned Mr. Micawber, whose face clouded at this 
              reference, 'she is but so-so. And this,' said Mr. Micawber, nodding 
              his head sorrowfully, 'is the Bench! Where, for the first time in 
              many revolving years, the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities 
              was not proclaimed, from day to day, by importune voices declining 
              to vacate the passage; where there was no knocker on the door for 
              any creditor to appeal to; where personal service of process was 
              not required, and detainees were merely lodged at the gate! Gentlemen,' 
              said Mr. Micawber, 'when the shadow of that iron-work on the summit 
              of the brick structure has been reflected on the gravel of the Parade, 
              I have seen my children thread the mazes of the intricate pattern, 
              avoiding the dark marks. I have been familiar with every stone in 
              the place. If I betray weakness, you will know how to excuse me.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'We have all got on in life since then, Mr. Micawber,' said I. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield,' returned Mr. Micawber, bitterly, 'when I was 
              an inmate of that retreat I could look my fellow-man in the face, 
              and punch his head if he offended me. My fellow-man and myself are 
              no longer on those glorious terms!' </p>
            <p>　　Turning from the building in a downcast manner, Mr. Micawber 
              accepted my proffered arm on one side, and the proffered arm of 
              Traddles on the other, and walked away between us. </p>
            <p>　　'There are some landmarks,' observed Mr. Micawber, looking fondly 
              back over his shoulder, 'on the road to the tomb, which, but for 
              the impiety of the aspiration, a man would wish never to have passed. 
              Such is the Bench in my chequered career.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, you are in low spirits, Mr. Micawber,' said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'I am, sir,' interposed Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'I hope,' said Traddles, 'it is not because you have conceived 
              a dislike to the law - for I am a lawyer myself, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber answered not a word. </p>
            <p>　　'How is our friend Heep, Mr. Micawber?' said I, after a silence. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' returned Mr. Micawber, bursting into a 
              state of much excitement, and turning pale, 'if you ask after my 
              employer as your friend, I am sorry for it; if you ask after him 
              as MY friend, I sardonically smile at it. In whatever capacity you 
              ask after my employer, I beg, without offence to you, to limit my 
              reply to this - that whatever his state of health may be, his appearance 
              is foxy: not to say diabolical. You will allow me, as a private 
              individual, to decline pursuing a subject which has lashed me to 
              the utmost verge of desperation in my professional capacity.' </p>
            <p>　　I expressed my regret for having innocently touched upon a theme 
              that roused him so much. 'May I ask,' said I, 'without any hazard 
              of repeating the mistake, how my old friends Mr. and Miss Wickfield 
              are?' </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Wickfield,' said Mr. Micawber, now turning red, 'is, as 
              she always is, a pattern, and a bright example. My dear Copperfield, 
              she is the only starry spot in a miserable existence. My respect 
              for that young lady, my admiration of her character, my devotion 
              to her for her love and truth, and goodness! - Take me,' said Mr. 
              Micawber, 'down a turning, for, upon my soul, in my present state 
              of mind I am not equal to this!' </p>
            <p>　　We wheeled him off into a narrow street, where he took out his 
              pocket-handkerchief, and stood with his back to a wall. If I looked 
              as gravely at him as Traddles did, he must have found our company 
              by no means inspiriting. </p>
            <p>　　'It is my fate,' said Mr. Micawber, unfeignedly sobbing, but 
              doing even that, with a shadow of the old expression of doing something 
              genteel; 'it is my fate, gentlemen, that the finer feelings of our 
              nature have become reproaches to me. My homage to Miss Wickfield, 
              is a flight of arrows in my bosom. You had better leave me, if you 
              please, to walk the earth as a vagabond. The worm will settle my 
              business in double-quick time.' </p>
            <p>　　Without attending to this invocation, we stood by, until he put 
              up his pocket-handkerchief, pulled up his shirt-collar, and, to 
              delude any person in the neighbourhood who might have been observing 
              him, hummed a tune with his hat very much on one side. I then mentioned 
              - not knowing what might be lost if we lost sight of him yet - that 
              it would give me great pleasure to introduce him to my aunt, if 
              he would ride out to Highgate, where a bed was at his service. </p>
            <p>　　'You shall make us a glass of your own punch, Mr. Micawber,' 
              said I, 'and forget whatever you have on your mind, in pleasanter 
              reminiscences.' </p>
            <p>　　'Or, if confiding anything to friends will be more likely to 
              relieve you, you shall impart it to us, Mr. Micawber,' said Traddles, 
              prudently. </p>
            <p>　　'Gentlemen,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'do with me as you will! 
              I am a straw upon the surface of the deep, and am tossed in all 
              directions by the elephants - I beg your pardon; I should have said 
              the elements.' </p>
            <p>　　We walked on, arm-in-arm, again; found the coach in the act of 
              starting; and arrived at Highgate without encountering any difficulties 
              by the way. I was very uneasy and very uncertain in my mind what 
              to say or do for the best - so was Traddles, evidently. Mr. Micawber 
              was for the most part plunged into deep gloom. He occasionally made 
              an attempt to smarten himself, and hum the fag-end of a tune; but 
              his relapses into profound melancholy were only made the more impressive 
              by the mockery of a hat exceedingly on one side, and a shirt-collar 
              pulled up to his eyes. </p>
            <p>　　We went to my aunt's house rather than to mine, because of Dora's 
              not being well. My aunt presented herself on being sent for, and 
              welcomed Mr. Micawber with gracious cordiality. Mr. Micawber kissed 
              her hand, retired to the window, and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief, 
              had a mental wrestle with himself. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick was at home. He was by nature so exceedingly compassionate 
              of anyone who seemed to be ill at ease, and was so quick to find 
              any such person out, that he shook hands with Mr. Micawber, at least 
              half-a-dozen times in five minutes. To Mr. Micawber, in his trouble, 
              this warmth, on the part of a stranger, was so extremely touching, 
              that he could only say, on the occasion of each successive shake, 
              'My dear sir, you overpower me!' Which gratified Mr. Dick so much, 
              that he went at it again with greater vigour than before. </p>
            <p>　　'The friendliness of this gentleman,' said Mr. Micawber to my 
              aunt, 'if you will allow me, ma'am, to cull a figure of speech from 
              the vocabulary of our coarser national sports - floors me. To a 
              man who is struggling with a complicated burden of perplexity and 
              disquiet, such a reception is trying, I assure you.' </p>
            <p>　　'My friend Mr. Dick,' replied my aunt proudly, 'is not a common 
              man.' </p>
            <p>　　'That I am convinced of,' said Mr. Micawber. 'My dear sir!' for 
              Mr. Dick was shaking hands with him again; 'I am deeply sensible 
              of your cordiality!' </p>
            <p>　　'How do you find yourself?' said Mr. Dick, with an anxious look. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Indifferent, my dear sir,' returned Mr. Micawber, sighing. </p>
            <p>　　'You must keep up your spirits,' said Mr. Dick, 'and make yourself 
              as comfortable as possible.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber was quite overcome by these friendly words, and 
              by finding Mr. Dick's hand again within his own. 'It has been my 
              lot,' he observed, 'to meet, in the diversified panorama of human 
              existence, with an occasional oasis, but never with one so green, 
              so gushing, as the present!' </p>
            <p>　　At another time I should have been amused by this; but I felt 
              that we were all constrained and uneasy, and I watched Mr. Micawber 
              so anxiously, in his vacillations between an evident disposition 
              to reveal something, and a counter-disposition to reveal nothing, 
              that I was in a perfect fever. Traddles, sitting on the edge of 
              his chair, with his eyes wide open, and his hair more emphatically 
              erect than ever, stared by turns at the ground and at Mr. Micawber, 
              without so much as attempting to put in a word. My aunt, though 
              I saw that her shrewdest observation was concentrated on her new 
              guest, had more useful possession of her wits than either of us; 
              for she held him in conversation, and made it necessary for him 
              to talk, whether he liked it or not. </p>
            <p>　　'You are a very old friend of my nephew's, Mr. Micawber,' said 
              my aunt. 'I wish I had had the pleasure of seeing you before.' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'I wish I had had the honour 
              of knowing you at an earlier period. I was not always the wreck 
              you at present behold.' </p>
            <p>　　'I hope Mrs. Micawber and your family are well, sir,' said my 
              aunt. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber inclined his head. 'They are as well, ma'am,' he 
              desperately observed after a pause, 'as Aliens and Outcasts can 
              ever hope to be.' </p>
            <p>　　'Lord bless you, sir!' exclaimed my aunt, in her abrupt way. 
              'What are you talking about?' </p>
            <p>　　'The subsistence of my family, ma'am,' returned Mr. Micawber, 
              'trembles in the balance. My employer -' </p>
            <p>　　Here Mr. Micawber provokingly left off; and began to peel the 
              lemons that had been under my directions set before him, together 
              with all the other appliances he used in making punch. </p>
            <p>　　'Your employer, you know,' said Mr. Dick, jogging his arm as 
              a gentle reminder. </p>
            <p>　　'My good sir,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'you recall me, I am obliged 
              to you.' They shook hands again. 'My employer, ma'am - Mr. Heep 
              - once did me the favour to observe to me, that if I were not in 
              the receipt of the stipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement 
              with him, I should probably be a mountebank about the country, swallowing 
              a sword-blade, and eating the devouring element. For anything that 
              I can perceive to the contrary, it is still probable that my children 
              may be reduced to seek a livelihood by personal contortion, while 
              Mrs. Micawber abets their unnatural feats by playing the barrel-organ.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, with a random but expressive flourish of his knife, 
              signified that these performances might be expected to take place 
              after he was no more; then resumed his peeling with a desperate 
              air. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually 
              kept beside her, and eyed him attentively. Notwithstanding the aversion 
              with which I regarded the idea of entrapping him into any disclosure 
              he was not prepared to make voluntarily, I should have taken him 
              up at this point, but for the strange proceedings in which I saw 
              him engaged; whereof his putting the lemon-peel into the kettle, 
              the sugar into the snuffer-tray, the spirit into the empty jug, 
              and confidently attempting to pour boiling water out of a candlestick, 
              were among the most remarkable. I saw that a crisis was at hand, 
              and it came. He clattered all his means and implements together, 
              rose from his chair, pulled out his pocket-handkerchief, and burst 
              into tears. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, behind his handkerchief, 
              'this is an occupation, of all others, requiring an untroubled mind, 
              and self-respect. I cannot perform it. It is out of the question.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber,' said I, 'what is the matter? Pray speak out. 
              You are among friends.' </p>
            <p>　　'Among friends, sir!' repeated Mr. Micawber; and all he had reserved 
              came breaking out of him. 'Good heavens, it is principally because 
              I AM among friends that my state of mind is what it is. What is 
              the matter, gentlemen? What is NOT the matter? Villainy is the matter; 
              baseness is the matter; deception, fraud, conspiracy, are the matter; 
              and the name of the whole atrocious mass is - HEEP!' </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt clapped her hands, and we all started up as if we were 
              possessed. </p>
            <p>　　'The struggle is over!' said Mr. Micawber violently gesticulating 
              with his pocket-handkerchief, and fairly striking out from time 
              to time with both arms, as if he were swimming under superhuman 
              difficulties. 'I will lead this life no longer. I am a wretched 
              being, cut off from everything that makes life tolerable. I have 
              been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel's service. Give me 
              back my wife, give me back my family, substitute Micawber for the 
              petty wretch who walks about in the boots at present on my feet, 
              and call upon me to swallow a sword tomorrow, and I'll do it. With 
              an appetite!' </p>
            <p>　　I never saw a man so hot in my life. I tried to calm him, that 
              we might come to something rational; but he got hotter and hotter, 
              and wouldn't hear a word. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll put my hand in no man's hand,' said Mr. Micawber, gasping, 
              puffing, and sobbing, to that degree that he was like a man fighting 
              with cold water, 'until I have - blown to fragments - the - a - 
              detestable - serpent - HEEP! I'll partake of no one's hospitality, 
              until I have - a - moved Mount Vesuvius - to eruption - on - a - 
              the abandoned rascal - HEEP! Refreshment - a - underneath this roof 
              - particularly punch - would - a - choke me - unless - I had - previously 
              - choked the eyes - out of the head - a - of - interminable cheat, 
              and liar - HEEP! I - a- I'll know nobody - and - a - say nothing 
              - and - a - live nowhere - until I have crushed - to - a - undiscoverable 
              atoms - the - transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer - 
              HEEP!' </p>
            <p>　　I really had some fear of Mr. Micawber's dying on the spot. The 
              manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences, 
              and, whenever he found himself getting near the name of Heep, fought 
              his way on to it, dashed at it in a fainting state, and brought 
              it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous, was frightful; 
              but now, when he sank into a chair, steaming, and looked at us, 
              with every possible colour in his face that had no business there, 
              and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot 
              haste up his throat, whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead, 
              he had the appearance of being in the last extremity. I would have 
              gone to his assistance, but he waved me off, and wouldn't hear a 
              word. </p>
            <p>　　'No, Copperfield! - No communication - a - until - Miss Wickfield 
              - a - redress from wrongs inflicted by consummate scoundrel - HEEP!' 
              (I am quite convinced he could not have uttered three words, but 
              for the amazing energy with which this word inspired him when he 
              felt it coming.) 'Inviolable secret - a - from the whole world - 
              a - no exceptions - this day week - a - at breakfast-time - a - 
              everybody present - including aunt - a - and extremely friendly 
              gentleman - to be at the hotel at Canterbury - a - where - Mrs. 
              Micawber and myself - Auld Lang Syne in chorus - and - a - will 
              expose intolerable ruffian - HEEP! No more to say - a - or listen 
              to persuasion - go immediately - not capable - a - bear society 
              - upon the track of devoted and doomed traitor - HEEP!' </p>
            <p>　　With this last repetition of the magic word that had kept him 
              going at all, and in which he surpassed all his previous efforts, 
              Mr. Micawber rushed out of the house; leaving us in a state of excitement, 
              hope, and wonder, that reduced us to a condition little better than 
              his own. But even then his passion for writing letters was too strong 
              to be resisted; for while we were yet in the height of our excitement, 
              hope, and wonder, the following pastoral note was brought to me 
              from a neighbouring tavern, at which he had called to write it: 
              - </p>
            <p>　　 'Most secret and confidential. 'MY DEAR SIR, </p>
            <p>　　'I beg to be allowed to convey, through you, my apologies to 
              your excellent aunt for my late excitement. An explosion of a smouldering 
              volcano long suppressed, was the result of an internal contest more 
              easily conceived than described. </p>
            <p>　　'I trust I rendered tolerably intelligible my appointment for 
              the morning of this day week, at the house of public entertainment 
              at Canterbury, where Mrs. Micawber and myself had once the honour 
              of uniting our voices to yours, in the well-known strain of the 
              Immortal exciseman nurtured beyond the Tweed. </p>
            <p>　　'The duty done, and act of reparation performed, which can alone 
              enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal, I shall be known no more. 
              I shall simply require to be deposited in that place of universal 
              resort, where </p>
            <p>　　 Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude forefathers 
              of the hamlet sleep, </p>
            <p>　　 '- With the plain Inscription, </p>

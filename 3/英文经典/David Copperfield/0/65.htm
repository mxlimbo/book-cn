            <p>　　 And now my written story ends. I look back, once more - for 
              the last time - before I close these leaves. </p>
            <p>　　I see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road 
              of life. I see our children and our friends around us; and I hear 
              the roar of many voices, not indifferent to me as I travel on. </p>
            <p>　　What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd? 
              Lo, these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question! 
            </p>
            <p>　　Here is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of four-score 
              years and more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of six miles 
              at a stretch in winter weather. </p>
            <p>　　Always with her, here comes Peggotty, my good old nurse, likewise 
              in spectacles, accustomed to do needle-work at night very close 
              to the lamp, but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle, 
              a yard-measure in a little house, and a work-box with a picture 
              of St. Paul's upon the lid. </p>
            <p>　　The cheeks and arms of Peggotty, so hard and red in my childish 
              days, when I wondered why the birds didn't peck her in preference 
              to apples, are shrivelled now; and her eyes, that used to darken 
              their whole neighbourhood in her face, are fainter (though they 
              glitter still); but her rough forefinger, which I once associated 
              with a pocket nutmeg-grater, is just the same, and when I see my 
              least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her, I 
              think of our little parlour at home, when I could scarcely walk. 
              My aunt's old disappointment is set right, now. She is godmother 
              to a real living Betsey Trotwood; and Dora (the next in order) says 
              she spoils her. </p>
            <p>　　There is something bulky in Peggotty's pocket. It is nothing 
              smaller than the Crocodile Book, which is in rather a dilapidated 
              condition by this time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched 
              across, but which Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious 
              relic. I find it very curious to see my own infant face, looking 
              up at me from the Crocodile stories; and to be reminded by it of 
              my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield. </p>
            <p>　　Among my boys, this summer holiday time, I see an old man making 
              giant kites, and gazing at them in the air, with a delight for which 
              there are no words. He greets me rapturously, and whispers, with 
              many nods and winks, 'Trotwood, you will be glad to hear that I 
              shall finish the Memorial when I have nothing else to do, and that 
              your aunt's the most extraordinary woman in the world, sir!' </p>
            <p>　　Who is this bent lady, supporting herself by a stick, and showing 
              me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and 
              beauty, feebly contending with a querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering 
              of the mind? She is in a garden; and near her stands a sharp, dark, 
              withered woman, with a white scar on her lip. Let me hear what they 
              say. </p>
            <p>　　'Rosa, I have forgotten this gentleman's name.' </p>
            <p>　　Rosa bends over her, and calls to her, 'Mr. Copperfield.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am glad to see you, sir. I am sorry to observe you are in 
              mourning. I hope Time will be good to you.' </p>
            <p>　　Her impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I am not in mourning, 
              bids her look again, tries to rouse her. </p>
            <p>　　'You have seen my son, sir,' says the elder lady. 'Are you reconciled?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Looking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and 
              moans. Suddenly, she cries, in a terrible voice, 'Rosa, come to 
              me. He is dead!' Rosa kneeling at her feet, by turns caresses her, 
              and quarrels with her; now fiercely telling her, 'I loved him better 
              than you ever did!'- now soothing her to sleep on her breast, like 
              a sick child. Thus I leave them; thus I always find them; thus they 
              wear their time away, from year to year. </p>
            <p>　　What ship comes sailing home from India, and what English lady 
              is this, married to a growling old Scotch Croesus with great flaps 
              of ears? Can this be Julia Mills? </p>
            <p>　　Indeed it is Julia Mills, peevish and fine, with a black man 
              to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver, and a copper-coloured 
              woman in linen, with a bright handkerchief round her head, to serve 
              her Tiffin in her dressing-room. But Julia keeps no diary in these 
              days; never sings Affection's Dirge; eternally quarrels with the 
              old Scotch Croesus, who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide. 
              Julia is steeped in money to the throat, and talks and thinks of 
              nothing else. I liked her better in the Desert of Sahara. </p>
            <p>　　Or perhaps this IS the Desert of Sahara! For, though Julia has 
              a stately house, and mighty company, and sumptuous dinners every 
              day, I see no green growth near her; nothing that can ever come 
              to fruit or flower. What Julia calls 'society', I see; among it 
              Mr. Jack Maldon, from his Patent Place, sneering at the hand that 
              gave it him, and speaking to me of the Doctor as 'so charmingly 
              antique'. But when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen 
              and ladies, Julia, and when its breeding is professed indifference 
              to everything that can advance or can retard mankind, I think we 
              must have lost ourselves in that same Desert of Sahara, and had 
              better find the way out. </p>
            <p>　　And lo, the Doctor, always our good friend, labouring at his 
              Dictionary (somewhere about the letter D), and happy in his home 
              and wife. Also the Old Soldier, on a considerably reduced footing, 
              and by no means so influential as in days of yore! </p>
            <p>　　Working at his chambers in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and 
              his hair (where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by 
              the constant friction of his lawyer's-wig, I come, in a later time, 
              upon my dear old Traddles. His table is covered with thick piles 
              of papers; and I say, as I look around me: </p>
            <p>　　'If Sophy were your clerk, now, Traddles, she would have enough 
              to do!' </p>
            <p>　　'You may say that, my dear Copperfield! But those were capital 
              days, too, in Holborn Court! Were they not?' </p>
            <p>　　'When she told you you would be a judge? But it was not the town 
              talk then!' </p>
            <p>　　'At all events,' says Traddles, 'if I ever am one -' 'Why, you 
              know you will be.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, my dear Copperfield, WHEN I am one, I shall tell the story, 
              as I said I would.' </p>
            <p>　　We walk away, arm in arm. I am going to have a family dinner 
              with Traddles. It is Sophy's birthday; and, on our road, Traddles 
              discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed. </p>
            <p>　　'I really have been able, my dear Copperfield, to do all that 
              I had most at heart. There's the Reverend Horace promoted to that 
              living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year; there are our two 
              boys receiving the very best education, and distinguishing themselves 
              as steady scholars and good fellows; there are three of the girls 
              married very comfortably; there are three more living with us; there 
              are three more keeping house for the Reverend Horace since Mrs. 
              Crewler's decease; and all of them happy.' </p>
            <p>　　'Except -' I suggest. </p>
            <p>　　'Except the Beauty,' says Traddles. 'Yes. It was very unfortunate 
              that she should marry such a vagabond. But there was a certain dash 
              and glare about him that caught her. However, now we have got her 
              safe at our house, and got rid of him, we must cheer her up again.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Traddles's house is one of the very houses - or it easily may 
              have been - which he and Sophy used to parcel out, in their evening 
              walks. It is a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his 
              dressing-room and his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze 
              themselves into upper rooms, reserving the best bedrooms for the 
              Beauty and the girls. There is no room to spare in the house; for 
              more of 'the girls' are here, and always are here, by some accident 
              or other, than I know how to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd 
              of them, running down to the door, and handing Traddles about to 
              be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, established in perpetuity, 
              is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here, at dinner 
              on Sophy's birthday, are the three married girls with their three 
              husbands, and one of the husband's brothers, and another husband's 
              cousin, and another husband's sister, who appears to me to be engaged 
              to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple, unaffected fellow 
              as he ever was, sits at the foot of the large table like a Patriarch; 
              and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space 
              that is certainly not glittering with Britannia metal. </p>
            <p>　　And now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, 
              these faces fade away. But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly 
              light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond 
              them all. And that remains. </p>
            <p>　　I turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　My lamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but 
              the dear presence, without which I were nothing, bears me company. 
            </p>
            <p>　　O Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my 
              life indeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me, like 
              the shadows which I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing 
              upward! </p>

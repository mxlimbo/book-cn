            <div align="center"><b>ABSENCE </b> </div>
            <p>　　 It was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me, haunted 
              by the ghosts of many hopes, of many dear remembrances, many errors, 
              many unavailing sorrows and regrets. </p>
            <p>　　I went away from England; not knowing, even then, how great the 
              shock was, that I had to bear. I left all who were dear to me, and 
              went away; and believed that I had borne it, and it was past. As 
              a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt, and scarcely 
              know that he is struck, so I, when I was left alone with my undisciplined 
              heart, had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive. 
            </p>
            <p>　　The knowledge came upon me, not quickly, but little by little, 
              and grain by grain. The desolate feeling with which I went abroad, 
              deepened and widened hourly. At first it was a heavy sense of loss 
              and sorrow, wherein I could distinguish little else. By imperceptible 
              degrees, it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost 
              - love, friendship, interest; of all that had been shattered - my 
              first trust, my first affection, the whole airy castle of my life; 
              of all that remained - a ruined blank and waste, lying wide around 
              me, unbroken, to the dark horizon. </p>
            <p>　　If my grief were selfish, I did not know it to be so. I mourned 
              for my child-wife, taken from her blooming world, so young. I mourned 
              for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands, 
              as he had won mine long ago. I mourned for the broken heart that 
              had found rest in the stormy sea; and for the wandering remnants 
              of the simple home, where I had heard the night-wind blowing, when 
              I was a child. </p>
            <p>　　From the accumulated sadness into which I fell, I had at length 
              no hope of ever issuing again. I roamed from place to place, carrying 
              my burden with me everywhere. I felt its whole weight now; and I 
              drooped beneath it, and I said in my heart that it could never be 
              lightened. </p>
            <p>　　When this despondency was at its worst, I believed that I should 
              die. Sometimes, I thought that I would like to die at home; and 
              actually turned back on my road, that I might get there soon. At 
              other times, I passed on farther away, -from city to city, seeking 
              I know not what, and trying to leave I know not what behind. </p>
            <p>　　It is not in my power to retrace, one by one, all the weary phases 
              of distress of mind through which I passed. There are some dreams 
              that can only be imperfectly and vaguely described; and when I oblige 
              myself to look back on this time of my life, I seem to be recalling 
              such a dream. I see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign 
              towns, palaces, cathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs, fantastic 
              streets - the old abiding places of History and Fancy - as a dreamer 
              might; bearing my painful load through all, and hardly conscious 
              of the objects as they fade before me. Listlessness to everything, 
              but brooding sorrow, was the night that fell on my undisciplined 
              heart. Let me look up from it - as at last I did, thank Heaven! 
              - and from its long, sad, wretched dream, to dawn. </p>
            <p>　　For many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon 
              my mind. Some blind reasons that I had for not returning home - 
              reasons then struggling within me, vainly, for more distinct expression 
              - kept me on my pilgrimage. Sometimes, I had proceeded restlessly 
              from place to place, stopping nowhere; sometimes, I had lingered 
              long in one spot. I had had no purpose, no sustaining soul within 
              me, anywhere. </p>
            <p>　　I was in Switzerland. I had come out of Italy, over one of the 
              great passes of the Alps, and had since wandered with a guide among 
              the by-ways of the mountains. If those awful solitudes had spoken 
              to my heart, I did not know it. I had found sublimity and wonder 
              in the dread heights and precipices, in the roaring torrents, and 
              the wastes of ice and snow; but as yet, they had taught me nothing 
              else. </p>
            <p>　　I came, one evening before sunset, down into a valley, where 
              I was to rest. In the course of my descent to it, by the winding 
              track along the mountain-side, from which I saw it shining far below, 
              I think some long-unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity, some 
              softening influence awakened by its peace, moved faintly in my breast. 
              I remember pausing once, with a kind of sorrow that was not all 
              oppressive, not quite despairing. I remember almost hoping that 
              some better change was possible within me. </p>
            <p>　　I came into the valley, as the evening sun was shining on the 
              remote heights of snow, that closed it in, like eternal clouds. 
              The bases of the mountains forming the gorge in which the little 
              village lay, were richly green; and high above this gentler vegetation, 
              grew forests of dark fir, cleaving the wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, 
              and stemming the avalanche. Above these, were range upon range of 
              craggy steeps, grey rock, bright ice, and smooth verdure-specks 
              of pasture, all gradually blending with the crowning snow. Dotted 
              here and there on the mountain's-side, each tiny dot a home, were 
              lonely wooden cottages, so dwarfed by the towering heights that 
              they appeared too small for toys. So did even the clustered village 
              in the valley, with its wooden bridge across the stream, where the 
              stream tumbled over broken rocks, and roared away among the trees. 
              In the quiet air, there was a sound of distant singing - shepherd 
              voices; but, as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the 
              mountain's-side, I could almost have believed it came from there, 
              and was not earthly music. All at once, in this serenity, great 
              Nature spoke to me; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon 
              the grass, and weep as I had not wept yet, since Dora died! </p>
            <p>　　I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes 
              before, and had strolled out of the village to read them while my 
              supper was making ready. Other packets had missed me, and I had 
              received none for a long time. Beyond a line or two, to say that 
              I was well, and had arrived at such a place, I had not had fortitude 
              or constancy to write a letter since I left home. </p>
            <p>　　The packet was in my hand. I opened it, and read the writing 
              of Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　She was happy and useful, was prospering as she had hoped. That 
              was all she told me of herself. The rest referred to me. </p>
            <p>　　She gave me no advice; she urged no duty on me; she only told 
              me, in her own fervent manner, what her trust in me was. She knew 
              (she said) how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good. 
              She knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it. She 
              was sure that in my every purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher 
              tendency, through the grief I had undergone. She, who so gloried 
              in my fame, and so looked forward to its augmentation, well knew 
              that I would labour on. She knew that in me, sorrow could not be 
              weakness, but must be strength. As the endurance of my childish 
              days had done its part to make me what I was, so greater calamities 
              would nerve me on, to be yet better than I was; and so, as they 
              had taught me, would I teach others. She commended me to God, who 
              had taken my innocent darling to His rest; and in her sisterly affection 
              cherished me always, and was always at my side go where I would; 
              proud of what I had done, but infinitely prouder yet of what I was 
              reserved to do. </p>
            <p>　　I put the letter in my breast, and thought what had I been an 
              hour ago! When I heard the voices die away, and saw the quiet evening 
              cloud grow dim, and all the colours in the valley fade, and the 
              golden snow upon the mountain-tops become a remote part of the pale 
              night sky, yet felt that the night was passing from my mind, and 
              all its shadows clearing, there was no name for the love I bore 
              her, dearer to me, henceforward, than ever until then. </p>
            <p>　　I read her letter many times. I wrote to her before I slept. 
              I told her that I had been in sore need of her help; that without 
              her I was not, and I never had been, what she thought me; but that 
              she inspired me to be that, and I would try. </p>
            <p>　　I did try. In three months more, a year would have passed since 
              the beginning of my sorrow. I determined to make no resolutions 
              until the expiration of those three months, but to try. I lived 
              in that valley, and its neighbourhood, all the time. </p>
            <p>　　The three months gone, I resolved to remain away from home for 
              some time longer; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland, 
              which was growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening; 
              to resume my pen; to work. </p>
            <p>　　I resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me; I sought out 
              Nature, never sought in vain; and I admitted to my breast the human 
              interest I had lately shrunk from. It was not long, before I had 
              almost as many friends in the valley as in Yarmouth: and when I 
              left it, before the winter set in, for Geneva, and came back in 
              the spring, their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me, although 
              they were not conveyed in English words. </p>
            <p>　　I worked early and late, patiently and hard. I wrote a Story, 
              with a purpose growing, not remotely, out of my experience, and 
              sent it to Traddles, and he arranged for its publication very advantageously 
              for me; and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach 
              me from travellers whom I encountered by chance. After some rest 
              and change, I fell to work, in my old ardent way, on a new fancy, 
              which took strong possession of me. As I advanced in the execution 
              of this task, I felt it more and more, and roused my utmost energies 
              to do it well. This was my third work of fiction. It was not half 
              written, when, in an interval of rest, I thought of returning home. 
            </p>
            <p>　　For a long time, though studying and working patiently, I had 
              accustomed myself to robust exercise. My health, severely impaired 
              when I left England, was quite restored. I had seen much. I had 
              been in many countries, and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I have now recalled all that I think it needful to recall here, 
              of this term of absence - with one reservation. I have made it, 
              thus far, with no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts; for, 
              as I have elsewhere said, this narrative is my written memory. I 
              have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart, and 
              to the last. I enter on it now. I cannot so completely penetrate 
              the mystery of my own heart, as to know when I began to think that 
              I might have set its earliest and brightest hopes on Agnes. I cannot 
              say at what stage of my grief it first became associated with the 
              reflection, that, in my wayward boyhood, I had thrown away the treasure 
              of her love. I believe I may have heard some whisper of that distant 
              thought, in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be 
              realized, of which I had been sensible. But the thought came into 
              my mind as a new reproach and new regret, when I was left so sad 
              and lonely in the world. </p>
            <p>　　If, at that time, I had been much with her, I should, in the 
              weakness of my desolation, have betrayed this. It was what I remotely 
              dreaded when I was first impelled to stay away from England. I could 
              not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection; 
              yet, in that betrayal, I should have set a constraint between us 
              hitherto unknown. </p>
            <p>　　I could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded 
              me had grown up in my own free choice and course. That if she had 
              ever loved me with another love - and I sometimes thought the time 
              was when she might have done so - I had cast it away. It was nothing, 
              now, that I had accustomed myself to think of her, when we were 
              both mere children, as one who was far removed from my wild fancies. 
              I had bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object; and 
              what I might have done, I had not done; and what Agnes was to me, 
              I and her own noble heart had made her. </p>
            <p>　　In the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me, when 
              I tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better 
              man, I did glance, through some indefinite probation, to a period 
              when I might possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past, and to be 
              so blessed as to marry her. But, as time wore on, this shadowy prospect 
              faded, and departed from me. If she had ever loved me, then, I should 
              hold her the more sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed 
              in her, her knowledge of my errant heart, the sacrifice she must 
              have made to be my friend and sister, and the victory she had won. 
              If she had never loved me, could I believe that she would love me 
              now? </p>
            <p>　　I had always felt my weakness, in comparison with her constancy 
              and fortitude; and now I felt it more and more. Whatever I might 
              have been to her, or she to me, if I had been more worthy of her 
              long ago, I was not now, and she was not. The time was past. I had 
              let it go by, and had deservedly lost her. </p>
            <p>　　That I suffered much in these contentions, that they filled me 
              with unhappiness and remorse, and yet that I had a sustaining sense 
              that it was required of me, in right and honour, to keep away from 
              myself, with shame, the thought of turning to the dear girl in the 
              withering of my hopes, from whom I had frivolously turned when they 
              were bright and fresh - which consideration was at the root of every 
              thought I had concerning her - is all equally true. I made no effort 
              to conceal from myself, now, that I loved her, that I was devoted 
              to her; but I brought the assurance home to myself, that it was 
              now too late, and that our long-subsisting relation must be undisturbed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I had thought, much and often, of my Dora's shadowing out to 
              me what might have happened, in those years that were destined not 
              to try us; I had considered how the things that never happen, are 
              often as much realities to us, in their effects, as those that are 
              accomplished. The very years she spoke of, were realities now, for 
              my correction; and would have been, one day, a little later perhaps, 
              though we had parted in our earliest folly. I endeavoured to convert 
              what might have been between myself and Agnes, into a means of making 
              me more self-denying, more resolved, more conscious of myself, and 
              my defects and errors. Thus, through the reflection that it might 
              have been, I arrived at the conviction that it could never be. </p>
            <p>　　These, with their perplexities and inconsistencies, were the 
              shifting quicksands of my mind, from the time of my departure to 
              the time of my return home, three years afterwards. Three years 
              had elapsed since the sailing of the emigrant ship; when, at that 
              same hour of sunset, and in the same place, I stood on the deck 
              of the packet vessel that brought me home, looking on the rosy water 
              where I had seen the image of that ship reflected. </p>
            <p>　　Three years. Long in the aggregate, though short as they went 
              by. And home was very dear to me, and Agnes too - but she was not 
              mine - she was never to be mine. She might have been, but that was 
              past! </p>

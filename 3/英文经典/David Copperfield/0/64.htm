            <p>　　What I have purposed to record is nearly finished; but there 
              is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory, on which it often rests 
              with delight, and without which one thread in the web I have spun 
              would have a ravelled end. </p>
            <p>　　I had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, 
              I had been married ten happy years. Agnes and I were sitting by 
              the fire, in our house in London, one night in spring, and three 
              of our children were playing in the room, when I was told that a 
              stranger wished to see me. </p>
            <p>　　He had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; 
              he had come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. 
              He was an old man, my servant said, and looked like a farmer. </p>
            <p>　　As this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was 
              like the beginning of a favourite story Agnes used to tell them, 
              introductory to the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who 
              hated everybody, it produced some commotion. One of our boys laid 
              his head in his mother's lap to be out of harm's way, and little 
              Agnes (our eldest child) left her doll in a chair to represent her, 
              and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the 
              window-curtains, to see what happened next. </p>
            <p>　　'Let him come in here!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　There soon appeared, pausing in the dark doorway as he entered, 
              a hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted by his looks, 
              had run to bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, 
              when my wife, starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated 
              voice, that it was Mr. Peggotty! </p>
            <p>　　It WAS Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, 
              strong old age. When our first emotion was over, and he sat before 
              the fire with the children on his knees, and the blaze shining on 
              his face, he looked, to me, as vigorous and robust, withal as handsome, 
              an old man, as ever I had seen. </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy,' said he. And the old name in the old tone fell 
              so naturally on my ear! 'Mas'r Davy, 'tis a joyful hour as I see 
              you, once more, 'long with your own trew wife!' </p>
            <p>　　'A joyful hour indeed, old friend!' cried I. </p>
            <p>　　'And these heer pretty ones,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'To look at 
              these heer flowers! Why, Mas'r Davy, you was but the heighth of 
              the littlest of these, when I first see you! When Em'ly warn't no 
              bigger, and our poor lad were BUT a lad!' </p>
            <p>　　'Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then,' 
              said I. 'But let these dear rogues go to bed; and as no house in 
              England but this must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage 
              (is the old black bag among it, that went so far, I wonder!), and 
              then, over a glass of Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of 
              ten years!' </p>
            <p>　　'Are you alone?' asked Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, ma'am,' he said, kissing her hand, 'quite alone.' </p>
            <p>　　We sat him between us, not knowing how to give him welcome enough; 
              and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice, I could have 
              fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his 
              darling niece. </p>
            <p>　　'It's a mort of water,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'fur to come across, 
              and on'y stay a matter of fower weeks. But water ('specially when 
              'tis salt) comes nat'ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am heer. 
              - Which is verse,' said Mr. Peggotty, surprised to find it out, 
              'though I hadn't such intentions.' </p>
            <p>　　'Are you going back those many thousand miles, so soon?' asked 
              Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, ma'am,' he returned. 'I giv the promise to Em'ly, afore 
              I come away. You see, I doen't grow younger as the years comes round, 
              and if I hadn't sailed as 'twas, most like I shouldn't never have 
              done 't. And it's allus been on my mind, as I must come and see 
              Mas'r Davy and your own sweet blooming self, in your wedded happiness, 
              afore I got to be too old.' </p>
            <p>　　He looked at us, as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently. 
              Agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair, 
              that he might see us better. </p>
            <p>　　'And now tell us,' said I, 'everything relating to your fortunes.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Our fortuns, Mas'r Davy,' he rejoined, 'is soon told. We haven't 
              fared nohows, but fared to thrive. We've allus thrived. We've worked 
              as we ought to 't, and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or 
              so, but we have allus thrived. What with sheep-farming, and what 
              with stock-farming, and what with one thing and what with t'other, 
              we are as well to do, as well could be. Theer's been kiender a blessing 
              fell upon us,' said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, 
              'and we've done nowt but prosper. That is, in the long run. If not 
              yesterday, why then today. If not today, why then tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　'And Emily?' said Agnes and I, both together. </p>
            <p>　　'Em'ly,' said he, 'arter you left her, ma'am - and I never heerd 
              her saying of her prayers at night, t'other side the canvas screen, 
              when we was settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name - and 
              arter she and me lost sight of Mas'r Davy, that theer shining sundown 
              - was that low, at first, that, if she had know'd then what Mas'r 
              Davy kep from us so kind and thowtful, 'tis my opinion she'd have 
              drooped away. But theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness 
              among 'em, and she took care of them; and theer was the children 
              in our company, and she took care of them; and so she got to be 
              busy, and to be doing good, and that helped her.' </p>
            <p>　　'When did she first hear of it?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'I kep it from her arter I heerd on 't,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'going 
              on nigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among 
              the beautifullest trees, and with the roses a-covering our Beein 
              to the roof. Theer come along one day, when I was out a-working 
              on the land, a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England 
              (I doen't rightly mind which), and of course we took him in, and 
              giv him to eat and drink, and made him welcome. We all do that, 
              all the colony over. He'd got an old newspaper with him, and some 
              other account in print of the storm. That's how she know'd it. When 
              I came home at night, I found she know'd it.' </p>
            <p>　　He dropped his voice as he said these words, and the gravity 
              I so well remembered overspread his face. </p>
            <p>　　'Did it change her much?' we asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Aye, for a good long time,' he said, shaking his head; 'if not 
              to this present hour. But I think the solitoode done her good. And 
              she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like, and minded 
              of it, and come through. I wonder,' he said thoughtfully, 'if you 
              could see my Em'ly now, Mas'r Davy, whether you'd know her!' </p>
            <p>　　'Is she so altered?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'I doen't know. I see her ev'ry day, and doen't know; But, odd-times, 
              I have thowt so. A slight figure,' said Mr. Peggotty, looking at 
              the fire, 'kiender worn; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes; a delicate 
              face; a pritty head, leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way 
              - timid a'most. That's Em'ly!' </p>
            <p>　　We silently observed him as he sat, still looking at the fire. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Some thinks,' he said, 'as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, 
              as her marriage was broken off by death. No one knows how 'tis. 
              She might have married well, a mort of times, &quot;but, uncle,&quot; 
              she says to me, &quot;that's gone for ever.&quot; Cheerful along 
              with me; retired when others is by; fond of going any distance fur 
              to teach a child, or fur to tend a sick person, or fur to do some 
              kindness tow'rds a young girl's wedding (and she's done a many, 
              but has never seen one); fondly loving of her uncle; patient; liked 
              by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble. That's Em'ly!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He drew his hand across his face, and with a half-suppressed 
              sigh looked up from the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'Is Martha with you yet?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Martha,' he replied, 'got married, Mas'r Davy, in the second 
              year. A young man, a farm-labourer, as come by us on his way to 
              market with his mas'r's drays - a journey of over five hundred mile, 
              theer and back - made offers fur to take her fur his wife (wives 
              is very scarce theer), and then to set up fur their two selves in 
              the Bush. She spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story. I did. 
              They was married, and they live fower hundred mile away from any 
              voices but their own and the singing birds.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Gummidge?' I suggested. </p>
            <p>　　It was a pleasant key to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst 
              into a roar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, 
              as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked 
              boat. </p>
            <p>　　'Would you believe it!' he said. 'Why, someun even made offer 
              fur to marry her! If a ship's cook that was turning settler, Mas'r 
              Davy, didn't make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I'm Gormed 
              - and I can't say no fairer than that!' </p>
            <p>　　I never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstasy on the part of 
              Mr. Peggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave 
              off laughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, 
              and the greater Mr. Peggotty's ecstasy became, and the more he rubbed 
              his legs. </p>
            <p>　　'And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?' I asked, when I was grave enough. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'If you'll believe me,' returned Mr. Peggotty, 'Missis Gummidge, 
              'stead of saying &quot;thank you, I'm much obleeged to you, I ain't 
              a-going fur to change my condition at my time of life,&quot; up'd 
              with a bucket as was standing by, and laid it over that theer ship's 
              cook's head 'till he sung out fur help, and I went in and reskied 
              of him.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter, and Agnes and 
              I both kept him company. </p>
            <p>　　'But I must say this, for the good creetur,' he resumed, wiping 
              his face, when we were quite exhausted; 'she has been all she said 
              she'd be to us, and more. She's the willingest, the trewest, the 
              honestest-helping woman, Mas'r Davy, as ever draw'd the breath of 
              life. I have never know'd her to be lone and lorn, for a single 
              minute, not even when the colony was all afore us, and we was new 
              to it. And thinking of the old 'un is a thing she never done, I 
              do assure you, since she left England!' </p>
            <p>　　'Now, last, not least, Mr. Micawber,' said I. 'He has paid off 
              every obligation he incurred here - even to Traddles's bill, you 
              remember my dear Agnes - and therefore we may take it for granted 
              that he is doing well. But what is the latest news of him?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty, with a smile, put his hand in his breast-pocket, 
              and produced a flat-folded, paper parcel, from which he took out, 
              with much care, a little odd-looking newspaper. </p>
            <p>　　'You are to understan', Mas'r Davy,' said he, 'as we have left 
              the Bush now, being so well to do; and have gone right away round 
              to Port Middlebay Harbour, wheer theer's what we call a town.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Bless you, yes,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'and turned to with a will. 
              I never wish to meet a better gen'l'man for turning to with a will. 
              I've seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun, Mas'r 
              Davy, till I a'most thowt it would have melted away. And now he's 
              a Magistrate.' </p>
            <p>　　'A Magistrate, eh?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper, 
              where I read aloud as follows, from the Port Middlebay Times: </p>
            <p>　　 'The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and 
              townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District Magistrate, 
              came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel, which was crowded 
              to suffocation. It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven 
              persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time, exclusive 
              of the company in the passage and on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, 
              and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay, flocked to do honour to one 
              so deservedly esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. 
              Doctor Mell (of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) 
              presided, and on his right sat the distinguished guest. After the 
              removal of the cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully 
              executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like 
              notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), 
              the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously 
              received. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed 
              &quot;Our distinguished Guest, the ornament of our town. May he 
              never leave us but to better himself, and may his success among 
              us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible!&quot; 
              The cheering with which the toast was received defies description. 
              Again and again it rose and fell, like the waves of ocean. At length 
              all was hushed, and WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, presented himself 
              to return thanks. Far be it from us, in the present comparatively 
              imperfect state of the resources of our establishment, to endeavour 
              to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing 
              periods of his polished and highly-ornate address! Suffice it to 
              observe, that it was a masterpiece of eloquence; and that those 
              passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful 
              career to its source, and warned the younger portion of his auditory 
              from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they 
              were unable to liquidate, brought a tear into the manliest eye present. 
              The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; Mrs. MICAWBER (who gracefully 
              bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door, where a galaxy of 
              beauty was elevated on chairs, at once to witness and adorn the 
              gratifying scene), Mrs. RIDGER BEGS (late Miss Micawber); Mrs. MELL; 
              WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR (who convulsed the assembly by 
              humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks 
              in a speech, but would do so, with their permission, in a song); 
              Mrs. MICAWBER'S FAMILY (well known, it is needless to remark, in 
              the mother-country), &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. At the conclusion of 
              the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing. 
              Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported themselves until 
              Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber, Esquire, Junior, 
              and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena, fourth daughter of 
              Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.' </p>
            <p>　　 I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have 
              discovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor 
              pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing 
              to another part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and 
              I read thus: </p>
            <p>　　 ' TO DAVID COPPERFIELD, ESQUIRE, </p>
            <p>　　 'THE EMINENT AUTHOR. 'My Dear Sir, </p>
            <p>　　'Years have elapsed, since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing 
              the lineaments, now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable 
              portion of the civilized world. </p>
            <p>　　'But, my dear Sir, though estranged (by the force of circumstances 
              over which I have had no control) from the personal society of the 
              friend and companion of my youth, I have not been unmindful of his 
              soaring flight. Nor have I been debarred, </p>
            <p>　　 Though seas between us braid ha' roared, </p>
            <p>　　(BURNS) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has 
              spread before us. </p>
            <p>　　'I cannot, therefore, allow of the departure from this place 
              of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem, without, my 
              dear Sir, taking this public opportunity of thanking you, on my 
              own behalf, and, I may undertake to add, on that of the whole of 
              the Inhabitants of Port Middlebay, for the gratification of which 
              you are the ministering agent. </p>
            <p>　　'Go on, my dear Sir! You are not unknown here, you are not unappreciated. 
              Though &quot;remote&quot;, we are neither &quot;unfriended&quot;, 
              &quot;melancholy&quot;, nor (I may add) &quot;slow&quot;. Go on, 
              my dear Sir, in your Eagle course! The inhabitants of Port Middlebay 
              may at least aspire to watch it, with delight, with entertainment, 
              with instruction! </p>
            <p>　　'Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the 
              globe, will ever be found, while it has light and life, </p>
            <p>　　 'The 'Eye 'Appertaining to </p>
            <p>　　 'WILKINS MICAWBER, 'Magistrate.' </p>
            <p>　　 I found, on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper, 
              that Mr. Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that 
              journal. There was another letter from him in the same paper, touching 
              a bridge; there was an advertisement of a collection of similar 
              letters by him, to be shortly republished, in a neat volume, 'with 
              considerable additions'; and, unless I am very much mistaken, the 
              Leading Article was his also. </p>
            <p>　　We talked much of Mr. Micawber, on many other evenings while 
              Mr. Peggotty remained with us. He lived with us during the whole 
              term of his stay, - which, I think, was something less than a month, 
              - and his sister and my aunt came to London to see him. Agnes and 
              I parted from him aboard-ship, when he sailed; and we shall never 
              part from him more, on earth. </p>
            <p>　　But before he left, he went with me to Yarmouth, to see a little 
              tablet I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham. While 
              I was copying the plain inscription for him at his request, I saw 
              him stoop, and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little 
              earth. </p>
            <p>　　'For Em'ly,' he said, as he put it in his breast. 'I promised, 
              Mas'r Davy.' </p>

            <p>　　The morning had worn away in these inquiries, and I was sitting 
              on the step of an empty shop at a street corner, near the market-place, 
              deliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had 
              been mentioned, when a fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, 
              dropped a horsecloth. Something good-natured in the man's face, 
              as I handed it up, encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me 
              where Miss Trotwood lived; though I had asked the question so often, 
              that it almost died upon my lips. </p>
            <p>　　'Trotwood,' said he. 'Let me see. I know the name, too. Old lady?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' I said, 'rather.' </p>
            <p>　　'Pretty stiff in the back?' said he, making himself upright. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' I said. 'I should think it very likely.' </p>
            <p>　　'Carries a bag?' said he - 'bag with a good deal of room in it 
              - is gruffish, and comes down upon you, sharp?' </p>
            <p>　　My heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy 
              of this description. </p>
            <p>　　'Why then, I tell you what,' said he. 'If you go up there,' pointing 
              with his whip towards the heights, 'and keep right on till you come 
              to some houses facing the sea, I think you'll hear of her. My opinion 
              is she won't stand anything, so here's a penny for you.' </p>
            <p>　　I accepted the gift thankfully, and bought a loaf with it. Dispatching 
              this refreshment by the way, I went in the direction my friend had 
              indicated, and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses 
              he had mentioned. At length I saw some before me; and approaching 
              them, went into a little shop (it was what we used to call a general 
              shop, at home), and inquired if they could have the goodness to 
              tell me where Miss Trotwood lived. I addressed myself to a man behind 
              the counter, who was weighing some rice for a young woman; but the 
              latter, taking the inquiry to herself, turned round quickly. </p>
            <p>　　'My mistress?' she said. 'What do you want with her, boy?' </p>
            <p>　　'I want,' I replied, 'to speak to her, if you please.' </p>
            <p>　　'To beg of her, you mean,' retorted the damsel. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' I said, 'indeed.' But suddenly remembering that in truth 
              I came for no other purpose, I held my peace in confusion, and felt 
              my face burn. </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt's handmaid, as I supposed she was from what she had said, 
              put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop; telling 
              me that I could follow her, if I wanted to know where Miss Trotwood 
              lived. I needed no second permission; though I was by this time 
              in such a state of consternation and agitation, that my legs shook 
              under me. I followed the young woman, and we soon came to a very 
              neat little cottage with cheerful bow-windows: in front of it, a 
              small square gravelled court or garden full of flowers, carefully 
              tended, and smelling deliciously. </p>
            <p>　　'This is Miss Trotwood's,' said the young woman. 'Now you know; 
              and that's all I have got to say.' With which words she hurried 
              into the house, as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance; 
              and left me standing at the garden-gate, looking disconsolately 
              over the top of it towards the parlour window, where a muslin curtain 
              partly undrawn in the middle, a large round green screen or fan 
              fastened on to the windowsill, a small table, and a great chair, 
              suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful 
              state. </p>
            <p>　　My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition. The soles had 
              shed themselves bit by bit, and the upper leathers had broken and 
              burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them. 
              My hat (which had served me for a night-cap, too) was so crushed 
              and bent, that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill 
              need have been ashamed to vie with it. My shirt and trousers, stained 
              with heat, dew, grass, and the Kentish soil on which I had slept 
              - and torn besides - might have frightened the birds from my aunt's 
              garden, as I stood at the gate. My hair had known no comb or brush 
              since I left London. My face, neck, and hands, from unaccustomed 
              exposure to the air and sun, were burnt to a berry-brown. From head 
              to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust, as if 
              I had come out of a lime-kiln. In this plight, and with a strong 
              consciousness of it, I waited to introduce myself to, and make my 
              first impression on, my formidable aunt. </p>
            <p>　　The unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer, 
              after a while, that she was not there, I lifted up my eyes to the 
              window above it, where I saw a florid, pleasant-looking gentleman, 
              with a grey head, who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner, nodded 
              his head at me several times, shook it at me as often, laughed, 
              and went away. </p>
            <p>　　I had been discomposed enough before; but I was so much the more 
              discomposed by this unexpected behaviour, that I was on the point 
              of slinking off, to think how I had best proceed, when there came 
              out of the house a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap, 
              and a pair of gardening gloves on her hands, wearing a gardening 
              pocket like a toll-man's apron, and carrying a great knife. I knew 
              her immediately to be Miss Betsey, for she came stalking out of 
              the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking 
              up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery. </p>
            <p>　　'Go away!' said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, and making a distant 
              chop in the air with her knife. 'Go along! No boys here!' </p>
            <p>　　I watched her, with my heart at my lips, as she marched to a 
              corner of her garden, and stooped to dig up some little root there. 
              Then, without a scrap of courage, but with a great deal of desperation, 
              I went softly in and stood beside her, touching her with my finger. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, ma'am,' I began. </p>
            <p>　　She started and looked up. </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'EH?' exclaimed Miss Betsey, in a tone of amazement I have never 
              heard approached. 'If you please, aunt, I am your nephew.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Lord!' said my aunt. And sat flat down in the garden-path. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk - where 
              you came, on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama. I 
              have been very unhappy since she died. I have been slighted, and 
              taught nothing, and thrown upon myself, and put to work not fit 
              for me. It made me run away to you. I was robbed at first setting 
              out, and have walked all the way, and have never slept in a bed 
              since I began the journey.' Here my self-support gave way all at 
              once; and with a movement of my hands, intended to show her my ragged 
              state, and call it to witness that I had suffered something, I broke 
              into a passion of crying, which I suppose had been pent up within 
              me all the week. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged 
              from her countenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I 
              began to cry; when she got up in a great hurry, collared me, and 
              took me into the parlour. Her first proceeding there was to unlock 
              a tall press, bring out several bottles, and pour some of the contents 
              of each into my mouth. I think they must have been taken out at 
              random, for I am sure I tasted aniseed water, anchovy sauce, and 
              salad dressing. When she had administered these restoratives, as 
              I was still quite hysterical, and unable to control my sobs, she 
              put me on the sofa, with a shawl under my head, and the handkerchief 
              from her own head under my feet, lest I should sully the cover; 
              and then, sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I 
              have already mentioned, so that I could not see her face, ejaculated 
              at intervals, 'Mercy on us!' letting those exclamations off like 
              minute guns. </p>
            <p>　　After a time she rang the bell. 'Janet,' said my aunt, when her 
              servant came in. 'Go upstairs, give my compliments to Mr. Dick, 
              and say I wish to speak to him.' </p>
            <p>　　Janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the 
              sofa (I was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), 
              but went on her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, walked 
              up and down the room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me 
              from the upper window came in laughing. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, 'don't be a fool, because nobody can 
              be more discreet than you can, when you choose. We all know that. 
              So don't be a fool, whatever you are.' </p>
            <p>　　The gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, I thought, 
              as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, 'you have heard me mention David Copperfield? 
              Now don't pretend not to have a memory, because you and I know better.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'David Copperfield?' said Mr. Dick, who did not appear to me 
              to remember much about it. 'David Copperfield? Oh yes, to be sure. 
              David, certainly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well,' said my aunt, 'this is his boy - his son. He would be 
              as like his father as it's possible to be, if he was not so like 
              his mother, too.' </p>
            <p>　　'His son?' said Mr. Dick. 'David's son? Indeed!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' pursued my aunt, 'and he has done a pretty piece of business. 
              He has run away. Ah! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have 
              run away.' My aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character 
              and behaviour of the girl who never was born. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! you think she wouldn't have run away?' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　'Bless and save the man,' exclaimed my aunt, sharply, 'how he 
              talks! Don't I know she wouldn't? She would have lived with her 
              god-mother, and we should have been devoted to one another. Where, 
              in the name of wonder, should his sister, Betsey Trotwood, have 
              run from, or to?' </p>
            <p>　　'Nowhere,' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　'Well then,' returned my aunt, softened by the reply, 'how can 
              you pretend to be wool-gathering, Dick, when you are as sharp as 
              a surgeon's lancet? Now, here you see young David Copperfield, and 
              the question I put to you is, what shall I do with him?' </p>
            <p>　　'What shall you do with him?' said Mr. Dick, feebly, scratching 
              his head. 'Oh! do with him?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said my aunt, with a grave look, and her forefinger held 
              up. 'Come! I want some very sound advice.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, if I was you,' said Mr. Dick, considering, and looking 
              vacantly at me, 'I should -' The contemplation of me seemed to inspire 
              him with a sudden idea, and he added, briskly, 'I should wash him!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Janet,' said my aunt, turning round with a quiet triumph, which 
              I did not then understand, 'Mr. Dick sets us all right. Heat the 
              bath!' </p>
            <p>　　Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue, I could not 
              help observing my aunt, Mr. Dick, and Janet, while it was in progress, 
              and completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of 
              the room. </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt was a tall, hard-featured lady, but by no means ill-looking. 
              There was an inflexibility in her face, in her voice, in her gait 
              and carriage, amply sufficient to account for the effect she had 
              made upon a gentle creature like my mother; but her features were 
              rather handsome than otherwise, though unbending and austere. I 
              particularly noticed that she had a very quick, bright eye. Her 
              hair, which was grey, was arranged in two plain divisions, under 
              what I believe would be called a mob-cap; I mean a cap, much more 
              common then than now, with side-pieces fastening under the chin. 
              Her dress was of a lavender colour, and perfectly neat; but scantily 
              made, as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible. 
              I remember that I thought it, in form, more like a riding-habit 
              with the superfluous skirt cut off, than anything else. She wore 
              at her side a gentleman's gold watch, if I might judge from its 
              size and make, with an appropriate chain and seals; she had some 
              linen at her throat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her 
              wrists like little shirt-wristbands. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick, as I have already said, was grey-headed, and florid: 
              I should have said all about him, in saying so, had not his head 
              been curiously bowed - not by age; it reminded me of one of Mr. 
              Creakle's boys' heads after a beating - and his grey eyes prominent 
              and large, with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that 
              made me, in combination with his vacant manner, his submission to 
              my aunt, and his childish delight when she praised him, suspect 
              him of being a little mad; though, if he were mad, how he came to 
              be there puzzled me extremely. He was dressed like any other ordinary 
              gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat and waistcoat, and white 
              trousers; and had his watch in his fob, and his money in his pockets: 
              which he rattled as if he were very proud of it. </p>
            <p>　　Janet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty, 
              and a perfect picture of neatness. Though I made no further observation 
              of her at the moment, I may mention here what I did not discover 
              until afterwards, namely, that she was one of a series of protegees 
              whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in 
              a renouncement of mankind, and who had generally completed their 
              abjuration by marrying the baker. </p>
            <p>　　The room was as neat as Janet or my aunt. As I laid down my pen, 
              a moment since, to think of it, the air from the sea came blowing 
              in again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers; and I saw the old-fashioned 
              furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt's inviolable chair 
              and table by the round green fan in the bow-window, the drugget-covered 
              carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries, the old china, 
              the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves, the tall press guarding 
              all sorts of bottles and pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping with 
              the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa, taking note of everything. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Janet had gone away to get the bath ready, when my aunt, to my 
              great alarm, became in one moment rigid with indignation, and had 
              hardly voice to cry out, 'Janet! Donkeys!' </p>
            <p>　　Upon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house 
              were in flames, darted out on a little piece of green in front, 
              and warned off two saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed 
              to set hoof upon it; while my aunt, rushing out of the house, seized 
              the bridle of a third animal laden with a bestriding child, turned 
              him, led him forth from those sacred precincts, and boxed the ears 
              of the unlucky urchin in attendance who had dared to profane that 
              hallowed ground. </p>
            <p>　　To this hour I don't know whether my aunt had any lawful right 
              of way over that patch of green; but she had settled it in her own 
              mind that she had, and it was all the same to her. The one great 
              outrage of her life, demanding to be constantly avenged, was the 
              passage of a donkey over that immaculate spot. In whatever occupation 
              she was engaged, however interesting to her the conversation in 
              which she was taking part, a donkey turned the current of her ideas 
              in a moment, and she was upon him straight. Jugs of water, and watering-pots, 
              were kept in secret places ready to be discharged on the offending 
              boys; sticks were laid in ambush behind the door; sallies were made 
              at all hours; and incessant war prevailed. Perhaps this was an agreeable 
              excitement to the donkey-boys; or perhaps the more sagacious of 
              the donkeys, understanding how the case stood, delighted with constitutional 
              obstinacy in coming that way. I only know that there were three 
              alarms before the bath was ready; and that on the occasion of the 
              last and most desperate of all, I saw my aunt engage, single-handed, 
              with a sandy-headed lad of fifteen, and bump his sandy head against 
              her own gate, before he seemed to comprehend what was the matter. 
              These interruptions were of the more ridiculous to me, because she 
              was giving me broth out of a table-spoon at the time (having firmly 
              persuaded herself that I was actually starving, and must receive 
              nourishment at first in very small quantities), and, while my mouth 
              was yet open to receive the spoon, she would put it back into the 
              basin, cry 'Janet! Donkeys!' and go out to the assault. </p>
            <p>　　The bath was a great comfort. For I began to be sensible of acute 
              pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired 
              and low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together. 
              When I had bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in 
              a shirt and a pair of trousers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me 
              up in two or three great shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like, 
              I don't know, but I felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint 
              and drowsy, I soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep. </p>
            <p>　　It might have been a dream, originating in the fancy which had 
              occupied my mind so long, but I awoke with the impression that my 
              aunt had come and bent over me, and had put my hair away from my 
              face, and laid my head more comfortably, and had then stood looking 
              at me. The words, 'Pretty fellow,' or 'Poor fellow,' seemed to be 
              in my ears, too; but certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, 
              to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt, who 
              sat in the bow-window gazing at the sea from behind the green fan, 
              which was mounted on a kind of swivel, and turned any way. </p>
            <p>　　We dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding; 
              I sitting at table, not unlike a trussed bird myself, and moving 
              my arms with considerable difficulty. But as my aunt had swathed 
              me up, I made no complaint of being inconvenienced. All this time 
              I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me; but 
              she took her dinner in profound silence, except when she occasionally 
              fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite, and said, 'Mercy upon us!' 
              which did not by any means relieve my anxiety. </p>
            <p>　　The cloth being drawn, and some sherry put upon the table (of 
              which I had a glass), my aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again, who joined 
              us, and looked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend 
              to my story, which she elicited from me, gradually, by a course 
              of questions. During my recital, she kept her eyes on Mr. Dick, 
              who I thought would have gone to sleep but for that, and who, whensoever 
              he lapsed into a smile, was checked by a frown from my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby, that she must 
              go and be married again,' said my aunt, when I had finished, 'I 
              can't conceive.' </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband,' Mr. Dick 
              suggested. </p>
            <p>　　'Fell in love!' repeated my aunt. 'What do you mean? What business 
              had she to do it?' </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps,' Mr. Dick simpered, after thinking a little, 'she did 
              it for pleasure.' </p>
            <p>　　'Pleasure, indeed!' replied my aunt. 'A mighty pleasure for the 
              poor Baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow, certain 
              to ill-use her in some way or other. What did she propose to herself, 
              I should like to know! She had had one husband. She had seen David 
              Copperfield out of the world, who was always running after wax dolls 
              from his cradle. She had got a baby - oh, there were a pair of babies 
              when she gave birth to this child sitting here, that Friday night! 
              - and what more did she want?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick secretly shook his head at me, as if he thought there 
              was no getting over this. </p>
            <p>　　'She couldn't even have a baby like anybody else,' said my aunt. 
              'Where was this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood? Not forthcoming. 
              Don't tell me!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick seemed quite frightened. </p>
            <p>　　'That little man of a doctor, with his head on one side,' said 
              my aunt, 'Jellips, or whatever his name was, what was he about? 
              All he could do, was to say to me, like a robin redbreast - as he 
              is - &quot;It's a boy.&quot; A boy! Yah, the imbecility of the whole 
              set of 'em!' </p>
            <p>　　The heartiness of the ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly; 
              and me, too, if I am to tell the truth. </p>
            <p>　　'And then, as if this was not enough, and she had not stood sufficiently 
              in the light of this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood,' said my aunt, 
              'she marries a second time - goes and marries a Murderer - or a 
              man with a name like it - and stands in THIS child's light! And 
              the natural consequence is, as anybody but a baby might have foreseen, 
              that he prowls and wanders. He's as like Cain before he was grown 
              up, as he can be.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick looked hard at me, as if to identify me in this character. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And then there's that woman with the Pagan name,' said my aunt, 
              'that Peggotty, she goes and gets married next. Because she has 
              not seen enough of the evil attending such things, she goes and 
              gets married next, as the child relates. I only hope,' said my aunt, 
              shaking her head, 'that her husband is one of those Poker husbands 
              who abound in the newspapers, and will beat her well with one.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried, and made the 
              subject of such a wish. I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken. 
              That Peggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful, most 
              devoted, and most self-denying friend and servant in the world; 
              who had ever loved me dearly, who had ever loved my mother dearly; 
              who had held my mother's dying head upon her arm, on whose face 
              my mother had imprinted her last grateful kiss. And my remembrance 
              of them both, choking me, I broke down as I was trying to say that 
              her home was my home, and that all she had was mine, and that I 
              would have gone to her for shelter, but for her humble station, 
              which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on her - I broke 
              down, I say, as I was trying to say so, and laid my face in my hands 
              upon the table. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, well!' said my aunt, 'the child is right to stand by those 
              who have stood by him - Janet! Donkeys!' </p>
            <p>　　I thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkeys, 
              we should have come to a good understanding; for my aunt had laid 
              her hand on my shoulder, and the impulse was upon me, thus emboldened, 
              to embrace her and beseech her protection. But the interruption, 
              and the disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside, put 
              an end to all softer ideas for the present, and kept my aunt indignantly 
              declaiming to Mr. Dick about her determination to appeal for redress 
              to the laws of her country, and to bring actions for trespass against 
              the whole donkey proprietorship of Dover, until tea-time. </p>
            <p>　　After tea, we sat at the window - on the look-out, as I imagined, 
              from my aunt's sharp expression of face, for more invaders - until 
              dusk, when Janet set candles, and a backgammon-board, on the table, 
              and pulled down the blinds. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, with her grave look, and her forefinger 
              up as before, 'I am going to ask you another question. Look at this 
              child.' </p>
            <p>　　'David's son?' said Mr. Dick, with an attentive, puzzled face. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Exactly so,' returned my aunt. 'What would you do with him, 
              now?' </p>
            <p>　　'Do with David's son?' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　'Ay,' replied my aunt, 'with David's son.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said Mr. Dick. 'Yes. Do with - I should put him to bed.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Janet!' cried my aunt, with the same complacent triumph that 
              I had remarked before. 'Mr. Dick sets us all right. If the bed is 
              ready, we'll take him up to it.' </p>
            <p>　　Janet reporting it to be quite ready, I was taken up to it; kindly, 
              but in some sort like a prisoner; my aunt going in front and Janet 
              bringing up the rear. The only circumstance which gave me any new 
              hope, was my aunt's stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell 
              of fire that was prevalent there; and janet's replying that she 
              had been making tinder down in the kitchen, of my old shirt. But 
              there were no other clothes in my room than the odd heap of things 
              I wore; and when I was left there, with a little taper which my 
              aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five minutes, I heard them 
              lock my door on the outside. Turning these things over in my mind 
              I deemed it possible that my aunt, who could know nothing of me, 
              might suspect I had a habit of running away, and took precautions, 
              on that account, to have me in safe keeping. </p>
            <p>　　The room was a pleasant one, at the top of the house, overlooking 
              the sea, on which the moon was shining brilliantly. After I had 
              said my prayers, and the candle had burnt out, I remember how I 
              still sat looking at the moonlight on the water, as if I could hope 
              to read my fortune in it, as in a bright book; or to see my mother 
              with her child, coming from Heaven, along that shining path, to 
              look upon me as she had looked when I last saw her sweet face. I 
              remember how the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my 
              eyes away, yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which 
              the sight of the white-curtained bed - and how much more the lying 
              softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white sheets! - inspired. 
              I remember how I thought of all the solitary places under the night 
              sky where I had slept, and how I prayed that I never might be houseless 
              any more, and never might forget the houseless. I remember how I 
              seemed to float, then, down the melancholy glory of that track upon 
              the sea, away into the world of dreams. </p>

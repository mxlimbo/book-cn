              </b> </div>
            <p>　　 When I awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em'ly, 
              and her emotion last night, after Martha had left. I felt as if 
              I had come into the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tendernesses 
              in a sacred confidence, and that to disclose them, even to Steerforth, 
              would be wrong. I had no gentler feeling towards anyone than towards 
              the pretty creature who had been my playmate, and whom I have always 
              been persuaded, and shall always be persuaded, to my dying day, 
              I then devotedly loved. The repetition to any ears - even to Steerforth's 
              - of what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open 
              to me by an accident, I felt would be a rough deed, unworthy of 
              myself, unworthy of the light of our pure childhood, which I always 
              saw encircling her head. I made a resolution, therefore, to keep 
              it in my own breast; and there it gave her image a new grace. </p>
            <p>　　While we were at breakfast, a letter was delivered to me from 
              my aunt. As it contained matter on which I thought Steerforth could 
              advise me as well as anyone, and on which I knew I should be delighted 
              to consult him, I resolved to make it a subject of discussion on 
              our journey home. For the present we had enough to do, in taking 
              leave of all our friends. Mr. Barkis was far from being the last 
              among them, in his regret at our departure; and I believe would 
              even have opened the box again, and sacrificed another guinea, if 
              it would have kept us eight-and-forty hours in Yarmouth. Peggotty 
              and all her family were full of grief at our going. The whole house 
              of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good-bye; and there were 
              so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on Steerforth, when our 
              portmanteaux went to the coach, that if we had had the baggage of 
              a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters to carry 
              it. In a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned, 
              and left a great many people very sorry behind US. </p>
            <p>　　Do you stay long here, Littimer?' said I, as he stood waiting 
              to see the coach start. </p>
            <p>　　'No, sir,' he replied; 'probably not very long, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'He can hardly say, just now,' observed Steerforth, carelessly. 
              'He knows what he has to do, and he'll do it.' </p>
            <p>　　'That I am sure he will,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　Littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion, 
              and I felt about eight years old. He touched it once more, wishing 
              us a good journey; and we left him standing on the pavement, as 
              respectable a mystery as any pyramid in Egypt. </p>
            <p>　　For some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being 
              unusually silent, and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering, 
              within myself, when I should see the old places again, and what 
              new changes might happen to me or them in the meanwhile. At length 
              Steerforth, becoming gay and talkative in a moment, as he could 
              become anything he liked at any moment, pulled me by the arm: </p>
            <p>　　'Find a voice, David. What about that letter you were speaking 
              of at breakfast?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said I, taking it out of my pocket. 'It's from my aunt.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And what does she say, requiring consideration?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, she reminds me, Steerforth,' said I, 'that I came out on 
              this expedition to look about me, and to think a little.' </p>
            <p>　　'Which, of course, you have done?' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed I can't say I have, particularly. To tell you the truth, 
              I am afraid I have forgotten it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well! look about you now, and make up for your negligence,' 
              said Steerforth. 'Look to the right, and you'll see a flat country, 
              with a good deal of marsh in it; look to the left, and you'll see 
              the same. Look to the front, and you'll find no difference; look 
              to the rear, and there it is still.' I laughed, and replied that 
              I saw no suitable profession in the whole prospect; which was perhaps 
              to be attributed to its flatness. </p>
            <p>　　'What says our aunt on the subject?' inquired Steerforth, glancing 
              at the letter in my hand. 'Does she suggest anything?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, yes,' said I. 'She asks me, here, if I think I should like 
              to be a proctor? What do you think of it?' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, I don't know,' replied Steerforth, coolly. 'You may as 
              well do that as anything else, I suppose?' </p>
            <p>　　I could not help laughing again, at his balancing all callings 
              and professions so equally; and I told him so. </p>
            <p>　　'What is a proctor, Steerforth?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, he is a sort of monkish attorney,' replied Steerforth. 
              'He is, to some faded courts held in Doctors' Commons, - a lazy 
              old nook near St. Paul's Churchyard - what solicitors are to the 
              courts of law and equity. He is a functionary whose existence, in 
              the natural course of things, would have terminated about two hundred 
              years ago. I can tell you best what he is, by telling you what Doctors' 
              Commons is. It's a little out-of-the-way place, where they administer 
              what is called ecclesiastical law, and play all kinds of tricks 
              with obsolete old monsters of acts of Parliament, which three-fourths 
              of the world know nothing about, and the other fourth supposes to 
              have been dug up, in a fossil state, in the days of the Edwards. 
              It's a place that has an ancient monopoly in suits about people's 
              wills and people's marriages, and disputes among ships and boats.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Nonsense, Steerforth!' I exclaimed. 'You don't mean to say that 
              there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical 
              matters?' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't, indeed, my dear boy,' he returned; 'but I mean to say 
              that they are managed and decided by the same set of people, down 
              in that same Doctors' Commons. You shall go there one day, and find 
              them blundering through half the nautical terms in Young's Dictionary, 
              apropos of the &quot;Nancy&quot; having run down the &quot;Sarah 
              Jane&quot;, or Mr. Peggotty and the Yarmouth boatmen having put 
              off in a gale of wind with an anchor and cable to the &quot;Nelson&quot; 
              Indiaman in distress; and you shall go there another day, and find 
              them deep in the evidence, pro and con, respecting a clergyman who 
              has misbehaved himself; and you shall find the judge in the nautical 
              case, the advocate in the clergyman's case, or contrariwise. They 
              are like actors: now a man's a judge, and now he is not a judge; 
              now he's one thing, now he's another; now he's something else, change 
              and change about; but it's always a very pleasant, profitable little 
              affair of private theatricals, presented to an uncommonly select 
              audience.' </p>
            <p>　　'But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?' said I, 
              a little puzzled. 'Are they?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' returned Steerforth, 'the advocates are civilians - men 
              who have taken a doctor's degree at college - which is the first 
              reason of my knowing anything about it. The proctors employ the 
              advocates. Both get very comfortable fees, and altogether they make 
              a mighty snug little party. On the whole, I would recommend you 
              to take to Doctors' Commons kindly, David. They plume them- selves 
              on their gentility there, I can tell you, if that's any satisfaction.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I made allowance for Steerforth's light way of treating the subject, 
              and, considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and 
              antiquity which I associated with that 'lazy old nook near St. Paul's 
              Churchyard', did not feel indisposed towards my aunt's suggestion; 
              which she left to my free decision, making no scruple of telling 
              me that it had occurred to her, on her lately visiting her own proctor 
              in Doctors' Commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'That's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all 
              events,' said Steerforth, when I mentioned it; 'and one deserving 
              of all encouragement. Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to 
              Doctors' Commons.' </p>
            <p>　　I quite made up my mind to do so. I then told Steerforth that 
              my aunt was in town awaiting me (as I found from her letter), and 
              that she had taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel 
              at Lincoln's Inn Fields, where there was a stone staircase, and 
              a convenient door in the roof; my aunt being firmly persuaded that 
              every house in London was going to be burnt down every night. </p>
            <p>　　We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring 
              to Doctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should 
              be a proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous 
              and whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our 
              journey's end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but 
              one; and I drove to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt 
              up, and waiting supper. </p>
            <p>　　If I had been round the world since we parted, we could hardly 
              have been better pleased to meet again. My aunt cried outright as 
              she embraced me; and said, pretending to laugh, that if my poor 
              mother had been alive, that silly little creature would have shed 
              tears, she had no doubt. </p>
            <p>　　'So you have left Mr. Dick behind, aunt?' said I. 'I am sorry 
              for that. Ah, Janet, how do you do?' </p>
            <p>　　As Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt's visage 
              lengthen very much. </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry for it, too,' said my aunt, rubbing her nose. 'I 
              have had no peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here.' Before 
              I could ask why, she told me. </p>
            <p>　　'I am convinced,' said my aunt, laying her hand with melancholy 
              firmness on the table, 'that Dick's character is not a character 
              to keep the donkeys off. I am confident he wants strength of purpose. 
              I ought to have left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might 
              perhaps have been at ease. If ever there was a donkey trespassing 
              on my green,' said my aunt, with emphasis, 'there was one this afternoon 
              at four o'clock. A cold feeling came over me from head to foot, 
              and I know it was a donkey!' </p>
            <p>　　I tried to comfort her on this point, but she rejected consolation. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'It was a donkey,' said my aunt; 'and it was the one with the 
              stumpy tail which that Murdering sister of a woman rode, when she 
              came to my house.' This had been, ever since, the only name my aunt 
              knew for Miss Murdstone. 'If there is any Donkey in Dover, whose 
              audacity it is harder to me to bear than another's, that,' said 
              my aunt, striking the table, 'is the animal!' </p>
            <p>　　Janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself 
              unnecessarily, and that she believed the donkey in question was 
              then engaged in the sand-and-gravel line of business, and was not 
              available for purposes of trespass. But my aunt wouldn't hear of 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　Supper was comfortably served and hot, though my aunt's rooms 
              were very high up - whether that she might have more stone stairs 
              for her money, or might be nearer to the door in the roof, I don't 
              know - and consisted of a roast fowl, a steak, and some vegetables, 
              to all of which I did ample justice, and which were all excellent. 
              But my aunt had her own ideas concerning London provision, and ate 
              but little. </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a 
              cellar,' said my aunt, 'and never took the air except on a hackney 
              coach-stand. I hope the steak may be beef, but I don't believe it. 
              Nothing's genuine in the place, in my opinion, but the dirt.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?' 
              I hinted. </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly not,' returned my aunt. 'It would be no pleasure to 
              a London tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended 
              it was.' </p>
            <p>　　I did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good 
              supper, which it greatly satisfied her to see me do. When the table 
              was cleared, Janet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her 
              nightcap, which was of a smarter construction than usual ('in case 
              of fire', my aunt said), and to fold her gown back over her knees, 
              these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going 
              to bed. I then made her, according to certain established regulations 
              from which no deviation, however slight, could ever be permitted, 
              a glass of hot wine and water, and a slice of toast cut into long 
              thin strips. With these accompaniments we were left alone to finish 
              the evening, my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and 
              water; soaking her strips of toast in it, one by one, before eating 
              them; and looking benignantly on me, from among the borders of her 
              nightcap. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Trot,' she began, 'what do you think of the proctor plan? 
              Or have you not begun to think about it yet?' </p>
            <p>　　'I have thought a good deal about it, my dear aunt, and I have 
              talked a good deal about it with Steerforth. I like it very much 
              indeed. I like it exceedingly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Come!' said my aunt. 'That's cheering!' </p>
            <p>　　'I have only one difficulty, aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'Say what it is, Trot,' she returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, I want to ask, aunt, as this seems, from what I understand, 
              to be a limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not 
              be very expensive?' </p>
            <p>　　'It will cost,' returned my aunt, 'to article you, just a thousand 
              pounds.' </p>
            <p>　　'Now, my dear aunt,' said I, drawing my chair nearer, 'I am uneasy 
              in my mind about that. It's a large sum of money. You have expended 
              a great deal on my education, and have always been as liberal to 
              me in all things as it was possible to be. You have been the soul 
              of generosity. Surely there are some ways in which I might begin 
              life with hardly any outlay, and yet begin with a good hope of getting 
              on by resolution and exertion. Are you sure that it would not be 
              better to try that course? Are you certain that you can afford to 
              part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be 
              so expended? I only ask you, my second mother, to consider. Are 
              you certain?' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then 
              engaged, looking me full in the face all the while; and then setting 
              her glass on the chimney-piece, and folding her hands upon her folded 
              skirts, replied as follows: </p>
            <p>　　'Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide 
              for your being a good, a sensible, and a happy man. I am bent upon 
              it - so is Dick. I should like some people that I know to hear Dick's 
              conversation on the subject. Its sagacity is wonderful. But no one 
              knows the resources of that man's intellect, except myself!' </p>
            <p>　　She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went 
              on: </p>
            <p>　　'It's in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some 
              influence upon the present. Perhaps I might have been better friends 
              with your poor father. Perhaps I might have been better friends 
              with that poor child your mother, even after your sister Betsey 
              Trotwood disappointed me. When you came to me, a little runaway 
              boy, all dusty and way-worn, perhaps I thought so. From that time 
              until now, Trot, you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and 
              a pleasure. I have no other claim upon my means; at least' - here 
              to my surprise she hesitated, and was confused - 'no, I have no 
              other claim upon my means - and you are my adopted child. Only be 
              a loving child to me in my age, and bear with my whims and fancies; 
              and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not 
              so happy or conciliating as it might have been, than ever that old 
              woman did for you.' </p>
            <p>　　It was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history. 
              There was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so, and of dismissing 
              it, which would have exalted her in my respect and affection, if 
              anything could. </p>
            <p>　　'All is agreed and understood between us, now, Trot,' said my 
              aunt, 'and we need talk of this no more. Give me a kiss, and we'll 
              go to the Commons after breakfast tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　We had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed. I slept 
              in a room on the same floor with my aunt's, and was a little disturbed 
              in the course of the night by her knocking at my door as often as 
              she was agitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, 
              and inquiring, 'if I heard the engines?' But towards morning she 
              slept better, and suffered me to do so too. </p>
            <p>　　At about mid-day, we set out for the office of Messrs Spenlow 
              and Jorkins, in Doctors' Commons. My aunt, who had this other general 
              opinion in reference to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, 
              gave me her purse to carry for her, which had ten guineas in it 
              and some silver. </p>
            <p>　　We made a pause at the toy shop in Fleet Street, to see the giants 
              of Saint Dunstan's strike upon the bells - we had timed our going, 
              so as to catch them at it, at twelve o'clock - and then went on 
              towards Ludgate Hill, and St. Paul's Churchyard. We were crossing 
              to the former place, when I found that my aunt greatly accelerated 
              her speed, and looked frightened. I observed, at the same time, 
              that a lowering ill-dressed man who had stopped and stared at us 
              in passing, a little before, was coming so close after us as to 
              brush against her. </p>
            <p>　　'Trot! My dear Trot!' cried my aunt, in a terrified whisper, 
              and pressing my arm. 'I don't know what I am to do.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't be alarmed,' said I. 'There's nothing to be afraid of. 
              Step into a shop, and I'll soon get rid of this fellow.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, child!' she returned. 'Don't speak to him for the world. 
              I entreat, I order you!' </p>
            <p>　　'Good Heaven, aunt!' said I. 'He is nothing but a sturdy beggar.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You don't know what he is!' replied my aunt. 'You don't know 
              who he is! You don't know what you say!' </p>
            <p>　　We had stopped in an empty door-way, while this was passing, 
              and he had stopped too. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't look at him!' said my aunt, as I turned my head indignantly, 
              'but get me a coach, my dear, and wait for me in St. Paul's Churchyard.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Wait for you?' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' rejoined my aunt. 'I must go alone. I must go with him.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'With him, aunt? This man?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am in my senses,' she replied, 'and I tell you I must. Get 
              mea coach!' </p>
            <p>　　However much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had 
              no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command. I 
              hurried away a few paces, and called a hackney-chariot which was 
              passing empty. Almost before I could let down the steps, my aunt 
              sprang in, I don't know how, and the man followed. She waved her 
              hand to me to go away, so earnestly, that, all confounded as I was, 
              I turned from them at once. In doing so, I heard her say to the 
              coachman, 'Drive anywhere! Drive straight on!' and presently the 
              chariot passed me, going up the hill. </p>
            <p>　　What Mr. Dick had told me, and what I had supposed to be a delusion 
              of his, now came into my mind. I could not doubt that this person 
              was the person of whom he had made such mysterious mention, though 
              what the nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be, I was 
              quite unable to imagine. After half an hour's cooling in the churchyard, 
              I saw the chariot coming back. The driver stopped beside me, and 
              my aunt was sitting in it alone. </p>
            <p>　　She had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to 
              be quite prepared for the visit we had to make. She desired me to 
              get into the chariot, and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up 
              and down a little while. She said no more, except, 'My dear child, 
              never ask me what it was, and don't refer to it,' until she had 
              perfectly regained her composure, when she told me she was quite 
              herself now, and we might get out. On her giving me her purse to 
              pay the driver, I found that all the guineas were gone, and only 
              the loose silver remained. </p>
            <p>　　Doctors' Commons was approached by a little low archway. Before 
              we had taken many paces down the street beyond it, the noise of 
              the city seemed to melt, as if by magic, into a softened distance. 
              A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the sky-lighted 
              offices of Spenlow and Jorkins; in the vestibule of which temple, 
              accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking, three or 
              four clerks were at work as copyists. One of these, a little dry 
              man, sitting by himself, who wore a stiff brown wig that looked 
              as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to receive my aunt, and 
              show us into Mr. Spenlow's room. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Spenlow's in Court, ma'am,' said the dry man; 'it's an Arches 
              day; but it's close by, and I'll send for him directly.' </p>
            <p>　　As we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched, 
              I availed myself of the opportunity. The furniture of the room was 
              old-fashioned and dusty; and the green baize on the top of the writing-table 
              had lost all its colour, and was as withered and pale as an old 
              pauper. There were a great many bundles of papers on it, some endorsed 
              as Allegations, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and some as 
              being in the Consistory Court, and some in the Arches Court, and 
              some in the Prerogative Court, and some in the Admiralty Court, 
              and some in the Delegates' Court; giving me occasion to wonder much, 
              how many Courts there might be in the gross, and how long it would 
              take to understand them all. Besides these, there were sundry immense 
              manuscript Books of Evidence taken on affidavit, strongly bound, 
              and tied together in massive sets, a set to each cause, as if every 
              cause were a history in ten or twenty volumes. All this looked tolerably 
              expensive, I thought, and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor's 
              business. I was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over 
              these and many similar objects, when hasty footsteps were heard 
              in the room outside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gown trimmed with 
              white fur, came hurrying in, taking off his hat as he came. </p>
            <p>　　He was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, 
              and the stiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars. He was buttoned 
              up, mighty trim and tight, and must have taken a great deal of pains 
              with his whiskers, which were accurately curled. His gold watch-chain 
              was so massive, that a fancy came across me, that he ought to have 
              a sinewy golden arm, to draw it out with, like those which are put 
              up over the goldbeaters' shops. He was got up with such care, and 
              was so stiff, that he could hardly bend himself; being obliged, 
              when he glanced at some papers on his desk, after sitting down in 
              his chair, to move his whole body, from the bottom of his spine, 
              like Punch. </p>
            <p>　　I had previously been presented by my aunt, and had been courteously 
              received. He now said: </p>
            <p>　　'And so, Mr. Copperfield, you think of entering into our profession? 
              I casually mentioned to Miss Trotwood, when I had the pleasure of 
              an interview with her the other day,' - with another inclination 
              of his body - Punch again - 'that there was a vacancy here. Miss 
              Trotwood was good enough to mention that she had a nephew who was 
              her peculiar care, and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly 
              in life. That nephew, I believe, I have now the pleasure of' - Punch 
              again. I bowed my acknowledgements, and said, my aunt had mentioned 
              to me that there was that opening, and that I believed I should 
              like it very much. That I was strongly inclined to like it, and 
              had taken immediately to the proposal. That I could not absolutely 
              pledge myself to like it, until I knew something more about it. 
              That although it was little else than a matter of form, I presumed 
              I should have an opportunity of trying how I liked it, before I 
              bound myself to it irrevocably. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh surely! surely!' said Mr. Spenlow. 'We always, in this house, 
              propose a month - an initiatory month. I should be happy, myself, 
              to propose two months - three - an indefinite period, in fact - 
              but I have a partner. Mr. Jorkins.' </p>
            <p>　　'And the premium, sir,' I returned, 'is a thousand pounds?' </p>
            <p>　　'And the premium, Stamp included, is a thousand pounds,' said 
              Mr. Spenlow. 'As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood, I am actuated 
              by no mercenary considerations; few men are less so, I believe; 
              but Mr. Jorkins has his opinions on these subjects, and I am bound 
              to respect Mr. Jorkins's opinions. Mr. Jorkins thinks a thousand 
              pounds too little, in short.' </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose, sir,' said I, still desiring to spare my aunt, 'that 
              it is not the custom here, if an articled clerk were particularly 
              useful, and made himself a perfect master of his profession' - I 
              could not help blushing, this looked so like praising myself - 'I 
              suppose it is not the custom, in the later years of his time, to 
              allow him any -' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Spenlow, by a great effort, just lifted his head far enough 
              out of his cravat to shake it, and answered, anticipating the word 
              'salary': </p>
            <p>　　'No. I will not say what consideration I might give to that point 
              myself, Mr. Copperfield, if I were unfettered. Mr. Jorkins is immovable.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible Jorkins. But 
              I found out afterwards that he was a mild man of a heavy temperament, 
              whose place in the business was to keep himself in the background, 
              and be constantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless 
              of men. If a clerk wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkins wouldn't 
              listen to such a proposition. If a client were slow to settle his 
              bill of costs, Mr. Jorkins was resolved to have it paid; and however 
              painful these things might be (and always were) to the feelings 
              of Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins would have his bond. The heart and hand 
              of the good angel Spenlow would have been always open, but for the 
              restraining demon Jorkins. As I have grown older, I think I have 
              had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle 
              of Spenlow and Jorkins! </p>
            <p>　　It was settled that I should begin my month's probation as soon 
              as I pleased, and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return 
              at its expiration, as the articles of agreement, of which I was 
              to be the subject, could easily be sent to her at home for her signature. 
              When we had got so far, Mr. Spenlow offered to take me into Court 
              then and there, and show me what sort of place it was. As I was 
              willing enough to know, we went out with this object, leaving my 
              aunt behind; who would trust herself, she said, in no such place, 
              and who, I think, regarded all Courts of Law as a sort of powder-mills 
              that might blow up at any time. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of 
              grave brick houses, which I inferred, from the Doctors' names upon 
              the doors, to be the official abiding-places of the learned advocates 
              of whom Steerforth had told me; and into a large dull room, not 
              unlike a chapel to my thinking, on the left hand. The upper part 
              of this room was fenced off from the rest; and there, on the two 
              sides of a raised platform of the horse-shoe form, sitting on easy 
              old-fashioned dining-room chairs, were sundry gentlemen in red gowns 
              and grey wigs, whom I found to be the Doctors aforesaid. Blinking 
              over a little desk like a pulpit-desk, in the curve of the horse-shoe, 
              was an old gentleman, whom, if I had seen him in an aviary, I should 
              certainly have taken for an owl, but who, I learned, was the presiding 
              judge. In the space within the horse-shoe, lower than these, that 
              is to say, on about the level of the floor, were sundry other gentlemen, 
              of Mr. Spenlow's rank, and dressed like him in black gowns with 
              white fur upon them, sitting at a long green table. Their cravats 
              were in general stiff, I thought, and their looks haughty; but in 
              this last respect I presently conceived I had done them an injustice, 
              for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question 
              of the presiding dignitary, I never saw anything more sheepish. 
              The public, represented by a boy with a comforter, and a shabby-genteel 
              man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets, was warming 
              itself at a stove in the centre of the Court. The languid stillness 
              of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by 
              the voice of one of the Doctors, who was wandering slowly through 
              a perfect library of evidence, and stopping to put up, from time 
              to time, at little roadside inns of argument on the journey. Altogether, 
              I have never, on any occasion, made one at such a cosey, dosey, 
              old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family-party 
              in all my life; and I felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to 
              belong to it in any character - except perhaps as a suitor. </p>
            <p>　　Very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat, I 
              informed Mr. Spenlow that I had seen enough for that time, and we 
              rejoined my aunt; in company with whom I presently departed from 
              the Commons, feeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins's, 
              on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point 
              me out. </p>
            <p>　　We arrived at Lincoln's Inn Fields without any new adventures, 
              except encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger's cart, 
              who suggested painful associations to my aunt. We had another long 
              talk about my plans, when we were safely housed; and as I knew she 
              was anxious to get home, and, between fire, food, and pickpockets, 
              could never be considered at her ease for half-an-hour in London, 
              I urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account, but to leave 
              me to take care of myself. </p>
            <p>　　'I have not been here a week tomorrow, without considering that 
              too, my dear,' she returned. 'There is a furnished little set of 
              chambers to be let in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you 
              to a marvel.' </p>
            <p>　　With this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an 
              advertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that 
              in Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let furnished, 
              with a view of the river, a singularly desirable, and compact set 
              of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman, 
              a member of one of the Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediate 
              possession. Terms moderate, and could be taken for a month only, 
              if required. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, this is the very thing, aunt!' said I, flushed with the 
              possible dignity of living in chambers. </p>
            <p>　　'Then come,' replied my aunt, immediately resuming the bonnet 
              she had a minute before laid aside. 'We'll go and look at 'em.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Away we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. 
              Crupp on the premises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed 
              to communicate with Mrs. Crupp. It was not until we had rung three 
              or four times that we could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to communicate 
              with us, but at last she appeared, being a stout lady with a flounce 
              of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown. </p>
            <p>　　'Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma'am,' said 
              my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'For this gentleman?' said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket 
              for her keys. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, for my nephew,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'And a sweet set they is for sich!' said Mrs. Crupp. </p>
            <p>　　So we went upstairs. </p>
            <p>　　They were on the top of the house - a great point with my aunt, 
              being near the fire-escape - and consisted of a little half-blind 
              entry where you could see hardly anything, a little stone-blind 
              pantry where you could see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a 
              bedroom. The furniture was rather faded, but quite good enough for 
              me; and, sure enough, the river was outside the windows. </p>
            <p>　　As I was delighted with the place, my aunt and Mrs. Crupp withdrew 
              into the pantry to discuss the terms, while I remained on the sitting-room 
              sofa, hardly daring to think it possible that I could be destined 
              to live in such a noble residence. After a single combat of some 
              duration they returned, and I saw, to my joy, both in Mrs. Crupp's 
              countenance and in my aunt's, that the deed was done. </p>
            <p>　　'Is it the last occupant's furniture?' inquired my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, it is, ma'am,' said Mrs. Crupp. </p>
            <p>　　'What's become of him?' asked my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Crupp was taken with a troublesome cough, in the midst of 
              which she articulated with much difficulty. 'He was took ill here, 
              ma'am, and - ugh! ugh! ugh! dear me! - and he died!' </p>
            <p>　　'Hey! What did he die of?' asked my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am, he died of drink,' said Mrs. Crupp, in confidence. 
              'And smoke.' </p>
            <p>　　'Smoke? You don't mean chimneys?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'No, ma'am,' returned Mrs. Crupp. 'Cigars and pipes.' </p>
            <p>　　'That's not catching, Trot, at any rate,' remarked my aunt, turning 
              to me. </p>
            <p>　　'No, indeed,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　In short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, 
              took them for a month, with leave to remain for twelve months when 
              that time was out. Mrs. Crupp was to find linen, and to cook; every 
              other necessary was already provided; and Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated 
              that she should always yearn towards me as a son. I was to take 
              possession the day after tomorrow, and Mrs. Crupp said, thank Heaven 
              she had now found summun she could care for! </p>
            <p>　　On our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted 
              that the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant, 
              which was all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, 
              in the intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes 
              and books from Mr. Wickfield's; relative to which, and to all my 
              late holiday, I wrote a long letter to Agnes, of which my aunt took 
              charge, as she was to leave on the succeeding day. Not to lengthen 
              these particulars, I need only add, that she made a handsome provision 
              for all my possible wants during my month of trial; that Steerforth, 
              to my great disappointment and hers too, did not make his appearance 
              before she went away; that I saw her safely seated in the Dover 
              coach, exulting in the coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys, 
              with Janet at her side; and that when the coach was gone, I turned 
              my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the old days when I used to 
              roam about its subterranean arches, and on the happy changes which 
              had brought me to the surface. </p>

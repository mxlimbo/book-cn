            <p>　　I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this 
              Book, in the first sensations of having finished it, to refer to 
              it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require. 
              My interest in it, is so recent and strong; and my mind is so divided 
              between pleasure and regret - pleasure in the achievement of a long 
              design, regret in the separation from many companions - that I am 
              in danger of wearying the reader whom I love, with personal confidences, 
              and private emotions. </p>
            <p>　　Besides which, all that I could say of the Story, to any purpose, 
              I have endeavoured to say in it. </p>
            <p>　　It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfully 
              the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years' imaginative task; 
              or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of 
              himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of 
              his brain are going from him for ever. Yet, I have nothing else 
              to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which might be of less 
              moment still) that no one can ever believe this Narrative, in the 
              reading, more than I have believed it in the writing. </p>
            <p>　　Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I cannot 
              close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful 
              glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green 
              leaves once a month, and with a faithful remembrance of the genial 
              sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, 
              and made me happy. London, October, 1850. </p>
            <p>　　 PREFACE TO THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION </p>
            <p>　　 I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book, that I did 
              not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it, in the first 
              sensations of having finished it, to refer to it with the composure 
              which this formal heading would seem to require. My interest in 
              it was so recent and strong, and my mind was so divided between 
              pleasure and regret - pleasure in the achievement of a long design, 
              regret in the separation from many companions - that I was in danger 
              of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Besides which, all that I could have said of the Story to any 
              purpose, I had endeavoured to say in it. </p>
            <p>　　It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know how sorrowfully 
              the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years' imaginative task; 
              or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of 
              himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of 
              his brain are going from him for ever. Yet, I had nothing else to 
              tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which might be of less 
              moment still), that no one can ever believe this Narrative, in the 
              reading, more than I believed it in the writing. </p>
            <p>　　So true are these avowals at the present day, that I can now 
              only take the reader into one confidence more. Of all my books, 
              I like this the best. It will be easily believed that I am a fond 
              parent to every child of my fancy, and that no one can ever love 
              that family as dearly as I love them. But, like many fond parents, 
              I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is 
              DAVID COPPERFIELD. 1869 </p>

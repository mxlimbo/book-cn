            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: 'Of 
              course he will.' </p>
            <p>　　'He is such a speaker,' I pursued, 'that he can win anybody over; 
              and I don't know what you'd say if you were to hear him sing, Mr. 
              Peggotty.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: 'I 
              have no doubt of it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then, he's such a generous, fine, noble fellow,' said I, quite 
              carried away by my favourite theme, 'that it's hardly possible to 
              give him as much praise as he deserves. I am sure I can never feel 
              thankful enough for the generosity with which he has protected me, 
              so much younger and lower in the school than himself.' </p>
            <p>　　I was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little 
              Em'ly's face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with 
              the deepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling 
              like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks. She looked so 
              extraordinarily earnest and pretty, that I stopped in a sort of 
              wonder; and they all observed her at the same time, for as I stopped, 
              they laughed and looked at her. </p>
            <p>　　'Em'ly is like me,' said Peggotty, 'and would like to see him.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Em'ly was confused by our all observing her, and hung down her 
              head, and her face was covered with blushes. Glancing up presently 
              through her stray curls, and seeing that we were all looking at 
              her still (I am sure I, for one, could have looked at her for hours), 
              she ran away, and kept away till it was nearly bedtime. </p>
            <p>　　I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat, and 
              the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before. 
              But I could not help fancying, now, that it moaned of those who 
              were gone; and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the 
              night and float the boat away, I thought of the sea that had risen, 
              since I last heard those sounds, and drowned my happy home. I recollect, 
              as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears, putting 
              a short clause into my prayers, petitioning that I might grow up 
              to marry little Em'ly, and so dropping lovingly asleep. </p>
            <p>　　The days passed pretty much as they had passed before, except 
              - it was a great exception- that little Em'ly and I seldom wandered 
              on the beach now. She had tasks to learn, and needle-work to do; 
              and was absent during a great part of each day. But I felt that 
              we should not have had those old wanderings, even if it had been 
              otherwise. Wild and full of childish whims as Em'ly was, she was 
              more of a little woman than I had supposed. She seemed to have got 
              a great distance away from me, in little more than a year. She liked 
              me, but she laughed at me, and tormented me; and when I went to 
              meet her, stole home another way, and was laughing at the door when 
              I came back, disappointed. The best times were when she sat quietly 
              at work in the doorway, and I sat on the wooden step at her feet, 
              reading to her. It seems to me, at this hour, that I have never 
              seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons; that I have 
              never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see, sitting 
              in the doorway of the old boat; that I have never beheld such sky, 
              such water, such glorified ships sailing away into golden air. </p>
            <p>　　On the very first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared 
              in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle 
              of oranges tied up in a handkerchief. As he made no allusion of 
              any kind to this property, he was supposed to have left it behind 
              him by accident when he went away; until Ham, running after him 
              to restore it, came back with the information that it was intended 
              for Peggotty. After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly 
              the same hour, and always with a little bundle, to which he never 
              alluded, and which he regularly put behind the door and left there. 
              These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric 
              description. Among them I remember a double set of pigs' trotters, 
              a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of apples, a pair of jet 
              earrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes, a canary bird 
              and cage, and a leg of pickled pork. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Barkis's wooing, as I remember it, was altogether of a peculiar 
              kind. He very seldom said anything; but would sit by the fire in 
              much the same attitude as he sat in his cart, and stare heavily 
              at Peggotty, who was opposite. One night, being, as I suppose, inspired 
              by love, he made a dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for her 
              thread, and put it in his waistcoat-pocket and carried it off. After 
              that, his great delight was to produce it when it was wanted, sticking 
              to the lining of his pocket, in a partially melted state, and pocket 
              it again when it was done with. He seemed to enjoy himself very 
              much, and not to feel at all called upon to talk. Even when he took 
              Peggotty out for a walk on the flats, he had no uneasiness on that 
              head, I believe; contenting himself with now and then asking her 
              if she was pretty comfortable; and I remember that sometimes, after 
              he was gone, Peggotty would throw her apron over her face, and laugh 
              for half-an-hour. Indeed, we were all more or less amused, except 
              that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtship would appear to have 
              been of an exactly parallel nature, she was so continually reminded 
              by these transactions of the old one. </p>
            <p>　　At length, when the term of my visit was nearly expired, it was 
              given out that Peggotty and Mr. Barkis were going to make a day's 
              holiday together, and that little Em'ly and I were to accompany 
              them. I had but a broken sleep the night before, in anticipation 
              of the pleasure of a whole day with Em'ly. We were all astir betimes 
              in the morning; and while we were yet at breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared 
              in the distance, driving a chaise-cart towards the object of his 
              affections. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty was dressed as usual, in her neat and quiet mourning; 
              but Mr. Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had 
              given him such good measure, that the cuffs would have rendered 
              gloves unnecessary in the coldest weather, while the collar was 
              so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head. 
              His bright buttons, too, were of the largest size. Rendered complete 
              by drab pantaloons and a buff waistcoat, I thought Mr. Barkis a 
              phenomenon of respectability. </p>
            <p>　　When we were all in a bustle outside the door, I found that Mr. 
              Peggotty was prepared with an old shoe, which was to be thrown after 
              us for luck, and which he offered to Mrs. Gummidge for that purpose. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No. It had better be done by somebody else, Dan'l,' said Mrs. 
              Gummidge. 'I'm a lone lorn creetur' myself, and everythink that 
              reminds me of creetur's that ain't lone and lorn, goes contrary 
              with me.' </p>
            <p>　　'Come, old gal!' cried Mr. Peggotty. 'Take and heave it.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, Dan'l,' returned Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her 
              head. 'If I felt less, I could do more. You don't feel like me, 
              Dan'l; thinks don't go contrary with you, nor you with them; you 
              had better do it yourself.' </p>
            <p>　　But here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another 
              in a hurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in 
              which we all were by this time (Em'ly and I on two little chairs, 
              side by side), that Mrs. Gummidge must do it. So Mrs. Gummidge did 
              it; and, I am sorry to relate, cast a damp upon the festive character 
              of our departure, by immediately bursting into tears, and sinking 
              subdued into the arms of Ham, with the declaration that she knowed 
              she was a burden, and had better be carried to the House at once. 
              Which I really thought was a sensible idea, that Ham might have 
              acted on. </p>
            <p>　　Away we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first 
              thing we did was to stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the 
              horse to some rails, and went in with Peggotty, leaving little Em'ly 
              and me alone in the chaise. I took that occasion to put my arm round 
              Em'ly's waist, and propose that as I was going away so very soon 
              now, we should determine to be very affectionate to one another, 
              and very happy, all day. Little Em'ly consenting, and allowing me 
              to kiss her, I became desperate; informing her, I recollect, that 
              I never could love another, and that I was prepared to shed the 
              blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections. </p>
            <p>　　How merry little Em'ly made herself about it! With what a demure 
              assumption of being immensely older and wiser than I, the fairy 
              little woman said I was 'a silly boy'; and then laughed so charmingly 
              that I forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name, 
              in the pleasure of looking at her. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good while in the church, but 
              came out at last, and then we drove away into the country. As we 
              were going along, Mr. Barkis turned to me, and said, with a wink, 
              - by the by, I should hardly have thought, before, that he could 
              wink: </p>
            <p>　　'What name was it as I wrote up in the cart?' </p>
            <p>　　'Clara Peggotty,' I answered. </p>
            <p>　　'What name would it be as I should write up now, if there was 
              a tilt here?' </p>
            <p>　　'Clara Peggotty, again?' I suggested. </p>
            <p>　　'Clara Peggotty BARKIS!' he returned, and burst into a roar of 
              laughter that shook the chaise. </p>
            <p>　　In a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for 
              no other purpose. Peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly 
              done; and the clerk had given her away, and there had been no witnesses 
              of the ceremony. She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made 
              this abrupt announcement of their union, and could not hug me enough 
              in token of her unimpaired affection; but she soon became herself 
              again, and said she was very glad it was over. </p>
            <p>　　We drove to a little inn in a by-road, where we were expected, 
              and where we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with 
              great satisfaction. If Peggotty had been married every day for the 
              last ten years, she could hardly have been more at her ease about 
              it; it made no sort of difference in her: she was just the same 
              as ever, and went out for a stroll with little Em'ly and me before 
              tea, while Mr. Barkis philosophically smoked his pipe, and enjoyed 
              himself, I suppose, with the contemplation of his happiness. If 
              so, it sharpened his appetite; for I distinctly call to mind that, 
              although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner, 
              and had finished off with a fowl or two, he was obliged to have 
              cold boiled bacon for tea, and disposed of a large quantity without 
              any emotion. </p>
            <p>　　I have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way 
              kind of wedding it must have been! We got into the chaise again 
              soon after dark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars, 
              and talking about them. I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. 
              Barkis's mind to an amazing extent. I told him all I knew, but he 
              would have believed anything I might have taken it into my head 
              to impart to him; for he had a profound veneration for my abilities, 
              and informed his wife in my hearing, on that very occasion, that 
              I was 'a young Roeshus' - by which I think he meant prodigy. </p>
            <p>　　When we had exhausted the subject of the stars, or rather when 
              I had exhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis, little Em'ly 
              and I made a cloak of an old wrapper, and sat under it for the rest 
              of the journey. Ah, how I loved her! What happiness (I thought) 
              if we were married, and were going away anywhere to live among the 
              trees and in the fields, never growing older, never growing wiser, 
              children ever, rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among 
              flowery meadows, laying down our heads on moss at night, in a sweet 
              sleep of purity and peace, and buried by the birds when we were 
              dead! Some such picture, with no real world in it, bright with the 
              light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar off, was in 
              my mind all the way. I am glad to think there were two such guileless 
              hearts at Peggotty's marriage as little Em'ly's and mine. I am glad 
              to think the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely 
              procession. </p>
            <p>　　Well, we came to the old boat again in good time at night; and 
              there Mr. and Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye, and drove away snugly 
              to their own home. I felt then, for the first time, that I had lost 
              Peggotty. I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under 
              any other roof but that which sheltered little Em'ly's head. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as 
              I did, and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces 
              to drive it away. Little Em'ly came and sat beside me on the locker 
              for the only time in all that visit; and it was altogether a wonderful 
              close to a wonderful day. </p>
            <p>　　It was a night tide; and soon after we went to bed, Mr. Peggotty 
              and Ham went out to fish. I felt very brave at being left alone 
              in the solitary house, the protector of Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge, 
              and only wished that a lion or a serpent, or any ill-disposed monster, 
              would make an attack upon us, that I might destroy him, and cover 
              myself with glory. But as nothing of the sort happened to be walking 
              about on Yarmouth flats that night, I provided the best substitute 
              I could by dreaming of dragons until morning. </p>
            <p>　　With morning came Peggotty; who called to me, as usual, under 
              my window as if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last 
              a dream too. After breakfast she took me to her own home, and a 
              beautiful little home it was. Of all the moveables in it, I must 
              have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in 
              the parlour (the tile-floored kitchen was the general sitting-room), 
              with a retreating top which opened, let down, and became a desk, 
              within which was a large quarto edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. 
              This precious volume, of which I do not recollect one word, I immediately 
              discovered and immediately applied myself to; and I never visited 
              the house afterwards, but I kneeled on a chair, opened the casket 
              where this gem was enshrined, spread my arms over the desk, and 
              fell to devouring the book afresh. I was chiefly edified, I am afraid, 
              by the pictures, which were numerous, and represented all kinds 
              of dismal horrors; but the Martyrs and Peggotty's house have been 
              inseparable in my mind ever since, and are now. </p>
            <p>　　I took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and 
              little Em'ly, that day; and passed the night at Peggotty's, in a 
              little room in the roof (with the Crocodile Book on a shelf by the 
              bed's head) which was to be always mine, Peggotty said, and should 
              always be kept for me in exactly the same state. </p>
            <p>　　'Young or old, Davy dear, as long as I am alive and have this 
              house over my head,' said Peggotty, 'you shall find it as if I expected 
              you here directly minute. I shall keep it every day, as I used to 
              keep your old little room, my darling; and if you was to go to China, 
              you might think of it as being kept just the same, all the time 
              you were away.' </p>
            <p>　　I felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse, with all 
              my heart, and thanked her as well as I could. That was not very 
              well, for she spoke to me thus, with her arms round my neck, in 
              the morning, and I was going home in the morning, and I went home 
              in the morning, with herself and Mr. Barkis in the cart. They left 
              me at the gate, not easily or lightly; and it was a strange sight 
              to me to see the cart go on, taking Peggotty away, and leaving me 
              under the old elm-trees looking at the house, in which there was 
              no face to look on mine with love or liking any more. </p>
            <p>　　And now I fell into a state of neglect, which I cannot look back 
              upon without compassion. I fell at once into a solitary condition, 
              - apart from all friendly notice, apart from the society of all 
              other boys of my own age, apart from all companionship but my own 
              spiritless thoughts, - which seems to cast its gloom upon this paper 
              as I write. </p>
            <p>　　What would I have given, to have been sent to the hardest school 
              that ever was kept! - to have been taught something, anyhow, anywhere! 
              No such hope dawned upon me. They disliked me; and they sullenly, 
              sternly, steadily, overlooked me. I think Mr. Murdstone's means 
              were straitened at about this time; but it is little to the purpose. 
              He could not bear me; and in putting me from him he tried, as I 
              believe, to put away the notion that I had any claim upon him - 
              and succeeded. </p>
            <p>　　I was not actively ill-used. I was not beaten, or starved; but 
              the wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting, and 
              was done in a systematic, passionless manner. Day after day, week 
              after week, month after month, I was coldly neglected. I wonder 
              sometimes, when I think of it, what they would have done if I had 
              been taken with an illness; whether I should have lain down in my 
              lonely room, and languished through it in my usual solitary way, 
              or whether anybody would have helped me out. </p>
            <p>　　When Mr. and Miss Murdstone were at home, I took my meals with 
              them; in their absence, I ate and drank by myself. At all times 
              I lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded, except 
              that they were jealous of my making any friends: thinking, perhaps, 
              that if I did, I might complain to someone. For this reason, though 
              Mr. Chillip often asked me to go and see him (he was a widower, 
              having, some years before that, lost a little small light-haired 
              wife, whom I can just remember connecting in my own thoughts with 
              a pale tortoise-shell cat), it was but seldom that I enjoyed the 
              happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a surgery; reading 
              some book that was new to me, with the smell of the whole Pharmacopoeia 
              coming up my nose, or pounding something in a mortar under his mild 
              directions. </p>
            <p>　　For the same reason, added no doubt to the old dislike of her, 
              I was seldom allowed to visit Peggotty. Faithful to her promise, 
              she either came to see me, or met me somewhere near, once every 
              week, and never empty-handed; but many and bitter were the disappointments 
              I had, in being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her 
              house. Some few times, however, at long intervals, I was allowed 
              to go there; and then I found out that Mr. Barkis was something 
              of a miser, or as Peggotty dutifully expressed it, was 'a little 
              near', and kept a heap of money in a box under his bed, which he 
              pretended was only full of coats and trousers. In this coffer, his 
              riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty, that the smallest 
              instalments could only be tempted out by artifice; so that Peggotty 
              had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme, a very Gunpowder Plot, 
              for every Saturday's expenses. </p>
            <p>　　All this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise 
              I had given, and of my being utterly neglected, that I should have 
              been perfectly miserable, I have no doubt, but for the old books. 
              They were my only comfort; and I was as true to them as they were 
              to me, and read them over and over I don't know how many times more. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I now approach a period of my life, which I can never lose the 
              remembrance of, while I remember anything: and the recollection 
              of which has often, without my invocation, come before me like a 
              ghost, and haunted happier times. </p>
            <p>　　I had been out, one day, loitering somewhere, in the listless, 
              meditative manner that my way of life engendered, when, turning 
              the corner of a lane near our house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking 
              with a gentleman. I was confused, and was going by them, when the 
              gentleman cried: </p>
            <p>　　'What! Brooks!' </p>
            <p>　　'No, sir, David Copperfield,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't tell me. You are Brooks,' said the gentleman. 'You are 
              Brooks of Sheffield. That's your name.' </p>
            <p>　　At these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively. His 
              laugh coming to my remembrance too, I knew him to be Mr. Quinion, 
              whom I had gone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see, before 
              - it is no matter - I need not recall when. </p>
            <p>　　'And how do you get on, and where are you being educated, Brooks?' 
              said Mr. Quinion. </p>
            <p>　　He had put his hand upon my shoulder, and turned me about, to 
              walk with them. I did not know what to reply, and glanced dubiously 
              at Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'He is at home at present,' said the latter. 'He is not being 
              educated anywhere. I don't know what to do with him. He is a difficult 
              subject.' </p>
            <p>　　That old, double look was on me for a moment; and then his eyes 
              darkened with a frown, as it turned, in its aversion, elsewhere. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Humph!' said Mr. Quinion, looking at us both, I thought. 'Fine 
              weather!' </p>
            <p>　　Silence ensued, and I was considering how I could best disengage 
              my shoulder from his hand, and go away, when he said: </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still? Eh, Brooks?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Aye! He is sharp enough,' said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently. 'You 
              had better let him go. He will not thank you for troubling him.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　On this hint, Mr. Quinion released me, and I made the best of 
              my way home. Looking back as I turned into the front garden, I saw 
              Mr. Murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard, and 
              Mr. Quinion talking to him. They were both looking after me, and 
              I felt that they were speaking of me. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Quinion lay at our house that night. After breakfast, the 
              next morning, I had put my chair away, and was going out of the 
              room, when Mr. Murdstone called me back. He then gravely repaired 
              to another table, where his sister sat herself at her desk. Mr. 
              Quinion, with his hands in his pockets, stood looking out of window; 
              and I stood looking at them all. </p>
            <p>　　'David,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'to the young this is a world for 
              action; not for moping and droning in.' </p>
            <p>　　- 'As you do,' added his sister. </p>
            <p>　　'Jane Murdstone, leave it to me, if you please. I say, David, 
              to the young this is a world for action, and not for moping and 
              droning in. It is especially so for a young boy of your disposition, 
              which requires a great deal of correcting; and to which no greater 
              service can be done than to force it to conform to the ways of the 
              working world, and to bend it and break it.' </p>
            <p>　　'For stubbornness won't do here,' said his sister 'What it wants 
              is, to be crushed. And crushed it must be. Shall be, too!' </p>
            <p>　　He gave her a look, half in remonstrance, half in approval, and 
              went on: </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose you know, David, that I am not rich. At any rate, 
              you know it now. You have received some considerable education already. 
              Education is costly; and even if it were not, and I could afford 
              it, I am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to 
              you to be kept at school. What is before you, is a fight with the 
              world; and the sooner you begin it, the better.' </p>
            <p>　　I think it occurred to me that I had already begun it, in my 
              poor way: but it occurs to me now, whether or no. </p>
            <p>　　'You have heard the &quot;counting-house&quot; mentioned sometimes,' 
              said Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'The counting-house, sir?' I repeated. 'Of Murdstone and Grinby, 
              in the wine trade,' he replied. </p>
            <p>　　I suppose I looked uncertain, for he went on hastily: </p>
            <p>　　'You have heard the &quot;counting-house&quot; mentioned, or 
              the business, or the cellars, or the wharf, or something about it.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I think I have heard the business mentioned, sir,' I said, remembering 
              what I vaguely knew of his and his sister's resources. 'But I don't 
              know when.' </p>
            <p>　　'It does not matter when,' he returned. 'Mr. Quinion manages 
              that business.' </p>
            <p>　　I glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out 
              of window. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other 
              boys, and that he sees no reason why it shouldn't, on the same terms, 
              give employment to you.' </p>
            <p>　　'He having,' Mr. Quinion observed in a low voice, and half turning 
              round, 'no other prospect, Murdstone.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Murdstone, with an impatient, even an angry gesture, resumed, 
              without noticing what he had said: </p>
            <p>　　'Those terms are, that you will earn enough for yourself to provide 
              for your eating and drinking, and pocket-money. Your lodging (which 
              I have arranged for) will be paid by me. So will your washing -' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'- Which will be kept down to my estimate,' said his sister. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Your clothes will be looked after for you, too,' said Mr. Murdstone; 
              'as you will not be able, yet awhile, to get them for yourself. 
              So you are now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin 
              the world on your own account.' </p>
            <p>　　'In short, you are provided for,' observed his sister; 'and will 
              please to do your duty.' </p>
            <p>　　Though I quite understood that the purpose of this announcement 
              was to get rid of me, I have no distinct remembrance whether it 
              pleased or frightened me. My impression is, that I was in a state 
              of confusion about it, and, oscillating between the two points, 
              touched neither. Nor had I much time for the clearing of my thoughts, 
              as Mr. Quinion was to go upon the morrow. </p>
            <p>　　Behold me, on the morrow, in a much-worn little white hat, with 
              a black crape round it for my mother, a black jacket, and a pair 
              of hard, stiff corduroy trousers - which Miss Murdstone considered 
              the best armour for the legs in that fight with the world which 
              was now to come off. behold me so attired, and with my little worldly 
              all before me in a small trunk, sitting, a lone lorn child (as Mrs. 
              Gummidge might have said), in the post-chaise that was carrying 
              Mr. Quinion to the London coach at Yarmouth! See, how our house 
              and church are lessening in the distance; how the grave beneath 
              the tree is blotted out by intervening objects; how the spire points 
              upwards from my old playground no more, and the sky is empty! </p>

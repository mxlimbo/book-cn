              <p> 　　THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL</p>
              <p> 　　Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the 
                southern edge of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq 
                from the Marne. At the present day it is a tolerably large town, 
                ornamented all the year through with plaster villas, and on Sundays 
                with beaming bourgeois. In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither 
                so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens:</p>
              <p> 　　it was only a village in the forest. Some pleasure-houses 
                of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which 
                were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twisted 
                iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts 
                of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; 
                but Montfermeil was none the less a village.</p>
              <p> 　　Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not 
                discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, which 
                was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, 
                that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, 
                water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the plateau.</p>
              <p> 　　It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; 
                the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent 
                ponds which exist in the woods there.</p>
              <p> 　　The other end, which surrounds the church and which lies in 
                the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water only at a little 
                spring half-way down the slope, near the road to Chelles, about 
                a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with 
                water. The large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thenardier 
                tavern formed a part, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man 
                who made a business of it, and who earned about eight sous a day 
                in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with water; but this 
                good man only worked until seven o'clock in the evening in summer, 
                and five in winter; and night once come and the shutters on the 
                ground floor once closed, he who had no water to drink went to 
                fetch it for himself or did without it.</p>
              <p> 　　This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the 
                reader has probably not forgotten,--little Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be remembered that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers 
                in two ways: they made the mother pay them, and they made the 
                child serve them. So when the mother ceased to pay altogether, 
                the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters, the Thenardiers 
                kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant in their house.</p>
              <p> 　　In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it 
                was required.</p>
              <p> 　　So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of going 
                to the spring at night, took great care that water should never 
                be lacking in the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. 
                The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither 
                snow nor frost up to that time.</p>
              <p> 　　Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission of the 
                mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village, 
                and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the same 
                tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, 
                and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader 
                will perhaps remember, the Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. 
                These people filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated 
                to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to play the part of a faithful historian, we ought 
                even to add that, among the curiosities displayed in the square, 
                there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in rags 
                and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil 
                in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our 
                Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and which have a tricolored 
                cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists call this bird 
                Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides, and 
                to the family of the vultures.</p>
              <p> 　　Some good old Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired to the 
                village, went to see this creature with great devotion. The mountebanks 
                gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made 
                by God expressly for their menagerie.</p>
              <p> 　　On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, 
                were seated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five 
                candles in the public room of Thenardier's hostelry.</p>
              <p> 　　This room resembled all drinking-shop rooms,--tables, pewter 
                jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; but little light and a great 
                deal of noise. The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, 
                by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class:</p>
              <p> 　　to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin.</p>
              <p> 　　The female Thenardier was attending to the supper, which was 
                roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with 
                his customers and talking politics.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides political conversations which had for their principal 
                subjects the Spanish war and M. le Duc d'Angouleme, strictly local 
                parentheses, like the following, were audible amid the uproar:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished 
                greatly. When ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. 
                They have yielded a great deal of juice under the press.&quot; 
                &quot;But the grapes cannot be ripe?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine 
                turns oily as soon as spring comes.&quot; &quot;Then it is very 
                thin wine?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are wines poorer even than these. The grapes must 
                be gathered while green.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Etc.</p>
              <p> 　　Or a miller would call out:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are we responsible for what is in the sacks?</p>
              <p> 　　We find in them a quantity of small seed which we cannot sift 
                out, and which we are obliged to send through the mill-stones; 
                there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host 
                of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which abound in certain 
                wheat, especially in Breton wheat.</p>
              <p> 　　I am not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers 
                like to saw beams with nails in them.</p>
              <p> 　　You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding.</p>
              <p> 　　And then people complain of the flour.</p>
              <p> 　　They are in the wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　The flour is no fault of ours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at 
                table with a landed proprietor who was fixing on a price for some 
                meadow work to be performed in the spring, was saying:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It does no harm to have the grass wet.</p>
              <p> 　　It cuts better. Dew is a good thing, sir.</p>
              <p> 　　It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young 
                and very hard to cut still.</p>
              <p> 　　It's terribly tender. It yields before the iron.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Etc.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of 
                the kitchen table near the chimney.</p>
              <p> 　　She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes, 
                and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings 
                destined for the young Thenardiers.</p>
              <p> 　　A very young kitten was playing about among the chairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Laughter and chatter were audible in the adjoining room, from 
                two fresh children's voices: it was Eponine and Azelma.</p>
              <p> 　　In the chimney-corner a cat-o'-nine-tails was hanging on a 
                nail.</p>
              <p> 　　At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere 
                in the house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was 
                a little boy who had been born to the Thenardiers during one of 
                the preceding winters,--&quot;she did not know why,&quot; she 
                said, &quot;the result of the cold,&quot;--and who was a little 
                more than three years old.</p>
              <p> 　　The mother had nursed him, but she did not love him. When 
                the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying, &quot;Your 
                son is squalling,&quot; Thenardier would say; &quot;do go and 
                see what he wants.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!&quot; the mother would reply, &quot;he bothers 
                me.&quot; And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.</p>

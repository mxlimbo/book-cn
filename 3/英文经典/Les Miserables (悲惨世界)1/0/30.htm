              <p>　　A DOUBLE QUARTETTE</p>
              <p>　　These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, 
                the third from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they 
                were students; and when one says student, one says Parisian:to 
                study in Paris is to be born in Paris.</p>
              <p>　　These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such 
                faces; four specimens of humanity taken at random; neither good 
                nor bad, neither wise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; 
                handsome, with that charming April which is called twenty years.</p>
              <p>　　They were four Oscars; for, at that epoch, Arthurs did not 
                yet exist.Burn for him the perfumes of Araby! exclaimed romance.Oscar 
                advances.</p>
              <p>　　Oscar, I shall behold him!</p>
              <p>　　People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian 
                and Caledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, 
                and the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the 
                battle of Waterloo.</p>
              <p>　　These Oscars bore the names, one of Felix Tholomyes, of Toulouse; 
                the second, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; 
                the last, Blachevelle, of Montauban.</p>
              <p>　　Naturally, each of them had his mistress.</p>
              <p>　　Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been 
                in England; Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname 
                the name of a flower; Fameuil idolized Zephine, an abridgment 
                of Josephine; Tholomyes had Fantine, called the Blonde, because 
                of her beautiful, sunny hair.</p>
              <p>　　Favourite, Dahlia, Zephine, and Fantine were four ravishing 
                young women, perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, 
                and not yet entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed 
                by intrigues, but still retaining on their faces something of 
                the serenity of toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty 
                which survives the first fall in woman.</p>
              <p>　　One of the four was called the young, because she was the youngest 
                of them, and one was called the old; the old one was twenty-three. 
                Not to conceal anything, the three first were more experienced, 
                more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of life than 
                Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.</p>
              <p>　　Dahlia, Zephine, and especially Favourite, could not have said 
                as much.There had already been more than one episode in their 
                romance, though hardly begun; and the lover who had borne the 
                name of Adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse 
                in the second, and Gustave in the third.</p>
              <p>　　Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds 
                and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people 
                have both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side.</p>
              <p>　　These badly guarded souls listen.</p>
              <p>　　Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the stones which 
                are thrown at them.They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that 
                is immaculate and inaccessible.</p>
              <p>　　Alas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry?</p>
              <p>　　Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and 
                Zephine.She had had an establishment of her own very early in 
                life.Her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics, 
                a brutal man and a braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite 
                of his age.This professor, when he was a young man, had one day 
                seen a chambermaid's gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in 
                love in consequence of this accident.</p>
              <p>　　The result had been Favourite.</p>
              <p>　　She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her.</p>
              <p>　　One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee, had entered 
                her apartments, and had said to her, &quot;You do not know me, 
                Mamemoiselle?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;No.&quot; &quot;I am your mother.&quot;Then the old woman 
                opened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which 
                she owned brought in, and installed herself.This cross and pious 
                old mother never spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering 
                a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down 
                to the porter's quarters for company, where she spoke ill of her 
                daughter.</p>
              <p>　　It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn 
                Dahlia to Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness.</p>
              <p>　　How could she make such nails work?</p>
              <p>　　She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her 
                hands.</p>
              <p>　　As for Zephine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and 
                caressing little way of saying &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends.Such 
                loves are always accompanied by such friendships.</p>
              <p>　　Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof 
                of this is that, after making all due allowances for these little 
                irregular households, Favourite, Zephine, and Dahlia were philosophical 
                young women, while Fantine was a good girl.</p>
              <p>　　Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyes?</p>
              <p>　　Solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom.</p>
              <p>　　We will confine ourselves to saying that the love of Fantine 
                was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.</p>
              <p>　　She alone, of all the four, was not called &quot;thou&quot; 
                by a single one of them.</p>
              <p>　　Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from 
                the dregs of the people.</p>
              <p>　　Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of 
                social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous 
                and the unknown.</p>
              <p>　　She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents?</p>
              <p>　　Who can say?</p>
              <p>　　She had never known father or mother.She was called Fantine.</p>
              <p>　　Why Fantine?</p>
              <p>　　She had never borne any other name.</p>
              <p>　　At the epoch of her birth the Directory still existed.She had 
                no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; the Church 
                no longer existed.</p>
              <p>　　She bore the name which pleased the first random passer-by, 
                who had encountered her, when a very small child, running bare-legged 
                in the street.</p>
              <p>　　She received the name as she received the water from the clouds 
                upon her brow when it rained.She was called little Fantine.</p>
              <p>　　No one knew more than that.</p>
              <p>　　This human creature had entered life in just this way.</p>
              <p>　　At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went to service 
                with some farmers in the neighborhood.</p>
              <p>　　At fifteen she came to Paris &quot;to seek her fortune.&quot;Fantine 
                was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could.She was 
                a lovely blonde, with fine teeth.</p>
              <p>　　She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on 
                her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.</p>
              <p>　　She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her 
                living,-- for the heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved.</p>
              <p>　　She loved Tholomyes.</p>
              <p>　　An amour for him; passion for her.</p>
              <p>　　The streets of the Latin quarter, filled with throngs of students 
                and grisettes, saw the beginning of their dream.</p>
              <p>　　Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes of the hill 
                of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, 
                but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again.There is 
                a way of avoiding which resembles seeking.</p>
              <p>　　In short, the eclogue took place.</p>
              <p>　　Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group 
                of which Tholomyes was the head.</p>
              <p>　　It was he who possessed the wit.</p>
              <p>　　Tholomyes was the antique old student; he was rich; he had 
                an income of four thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid 
                scandal on Mount Sainte-Genevieve. Tholomyes was a fast man of 
                thirty, and badly preserved.</p>
              <p>　　He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of 
                a bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull 
                at thirty, the knee at forty.</p>
              <p>　　His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked by a watering 
                in one eye.</p>
              <p>　　But in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; 
                he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, 
                his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly.</p>
              <p>　　He was dilapidated but still in flower.His youth, which was 
                packing up for departure long before its time, beat a retreat 
                in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything 
                but fire.</p>
              <p>　　He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville.He made a few 
                verses now and then.</p>
              <p>　　In addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, 
                which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak.</p>
              <p>　　Being thus ironical and bald, he was the leader.Iron is an 
                English word.</p>
              <p>　　Is it possible that irony is derived from it?</p>
              <p>　　One day Tholomyes took the three others aside, with the gesture 
                of an oracle, and said to them:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Fantine, Dahlia, Zephine, and Favourite have been teasing 
                us for nearly a year to give them a surprise.</p>
              <p>　　We have promised them solemnly that we would.</p>
              <p>　　They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular, 
                just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, `Faccia 
                gialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,' so 
                our beauties say to me incessantly, `Tholomyes, when will you 
                bring forth your surprise?'</p>
              <p>　　At the same time our parents keep writing to us.Pressure on 
                both sides.</p>
              <p>　　The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us discuss the 
                question.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Thereupon, Tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something 
                so mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon 
                the four mouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, &quot;That 
                is an idea.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder 
                of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.</p>
              <p>　　The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which 
                took place on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting 
                the four young girls.</p>

              <p>　　In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before 
                him in visible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, 
                formed the double rule of his soul,--the concealment of his name, 
                the sanctification of his life.</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct, 
                and he perceived the distance which separated them.</p>
              <p> 　　He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, 
                good, while the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, 
                and that the other was personality; that the one said, my neighbor, 
                and that the other said, myself; that one emanated from the light, 
                and the other from darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　They were antagonistic.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw them in conflict.</p>
              <p> 　　In proportion as he meditated, they grew before the eyes of 
                his spirit. They had now attained colossal statures, and it seemed 
                to him that he beheld within himself, in that infinity of which 
                we were recently speaking, in the midst of the darkness and the 
                lights, a goddess and a giant contending.</p>
              <p> 　　He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good 
                thought was getting the upper hand.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis 
                of his conscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked 
                the first phase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked 
                the second. After the grand crisis, the grand test.</p>
              <p> 　　But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession 
                of him.</p>
              <p> 　　A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued 
                to fortify him in his resolution.</p>
              <p> 　　One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking 
                the matter too keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was 
                not interesting, and that he had actually been guilty of theft.</p>
              <p> 　　He answered himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, that means 
                a month in prison.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a long way from that to the galleys. And who knows?</p>
              <p> 　　Did he steal?</p>
              <p> 　　Has it been proved?</p>
              <p> 　　The name of Jean Valjean overwhelms him, and seems to dispense 
                with proofs. Do not the attorneys for the Crown always proceed 
                in this manner? He is supposed to be a thief because he is known 
                to be a convict.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when 
                he denounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, 
                be taken into consideration, and his honest life for the last 
                seven years, and what he had done for the district, and that they 
                would have mercy on him.</p>
              <p> 　　But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled 
                bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from 
                little Gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second 
                offence after conviction, that this affair would certainly come 
                up, and, according to the precise terms of the law, would render 
                him liable to penal servitude for life.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more 
                and more from earth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. 
                He told himself that he must do his duty; that perhaps he should 
                not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided 
                it; that if he allowed things to take their own course, if he 
                remained at M. sur M., his consideration, his good name, his good 
                works, the deference and veneration paid to him, his charity, 
                his wealth, his popularity, his virtue, would be seasoned with 
                a crime. And what would be the taste of all these holy things 
                when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if he accomplished 
                his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys, 
                the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil, and 
                pitiless shame.</p>
              <p> 　　At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny 
                was thus allotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements 
                made on high, that, in any case, he must make his choice:</p>
              <p> 　　virtue without and abomination within, or holiness within 
                and infamy without.</p>
              <p> 　　The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his 
                courage to fail, but his brain grow weary.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to think of other things, of indifferent matters, 
                in spite of himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced 
                to and fro; midnight sounded first from the parish church, then 
                from the town-hall; he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, 
                and compared the sounds of the two bells; he recalled in this 
                connection the fact that, a few days previously, he had seen in 
                an ironmonger's shop an ancient clock for sale, upon which was 
                written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.</p>
              <p> 　　He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to 
                him to close the window.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged 
                to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the 
                subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck; he finally 
                succeeded in doing this.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! yes,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I had resolved 
                to inform against myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hold!&quot; said he, &quot;and what about that poor 
                woman?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here a fresh crisis declared itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced 
                the effect of an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as 
                though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect:</p>
              <p> 　　he exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; 
                it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to 
                conceal my person or to save my soul, to be a despicable and respected 
                magistrate, or an infamous and venerable convict; it is I, it 
                is always I and nothing but I: but, good God! all this is egotism; 
                these are diverse forms of egotism, but it is egotism all the 
                same. What if I were to think a little about others?</p>
              <p> 　　The highest holiness is to think of others; come, let us examine 
                the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_ forgotten, 
                what would be the result of all this?</p>
              <p> 　　What if I denounce myself?</p>
              <p> 　　I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back 
                in the galleys; that is well-- and what then?</p>
              <p> 　　What is going on here?</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! here is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, 
                workers, both men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people!</p>
              <p> 　　All this I have created; all these I provide with their living; 
                everywhere where there is a smoking chimney, it is I who have 
                placed the brand on the hearth and meat in the pot; I have created 
                ease, circulation, credit; before me there was nothing; I have 
                elevated, vivified, informed with life, fecundated, stimulated, 
                enriched the whole country-side; lacking me, the soul is lacking; 
                I take myself off, everything dies: and this woman, who has suffered 
                so much, who possesses so many merits in spite of her fall; the 
                cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been!</p>
              <p> 　　And that child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have 
                promised to her mother; do I not also owe something to this woman, 
                in reparation for the evil which I have done her? If I disappear, 
                what happens?</p>
              <p> 　　The mother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what 
                will take place, if I denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? 
                come, let us see how it will be if I do not denounce myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed 
                to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did 
                not last long, and he answered himself calmly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, 
                but what the deuce! he has stolen!</p>
              <p> 　　There is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of 
                theft, for he has!</p>
              <p> 　　I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall have made ten 
                millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing of my 
                own; what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am doing 
                it; the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused 
                and animated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, a 
                hundred families, a thousand families, are happy; the district 
                becomes populated; villages spring up where there were only farms 
                before; farms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, 
                and with wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; 
                all vices disappear, all crimes:</p>
              <p> 　　and this poor mother rears her child; and behold a whole country 
                rich and honest!</p>
              <p> 　　Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　I was a fool! I was absurd! what was that I was saying about 
                denouncing myself? I really must pay attention and not be precipitate 
                about anything. What! because it would have pleased me to play 
                the grand and generous; this is melodrama, after all; because 
                I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! for the 
                sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps, 
                but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a good-for-nothing, 
                evidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor woman must 
                die in the hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street! 
                like dogs; ah, this is abominable! And without the mother even 
                having seen her child once more, almost without the child's having 
                known her mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of 
                an apple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for 
                something else, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which 
                save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent, which save an old 
                vagabond who has only a few years to live at most, and who will 
                not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel, and which 
                sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. This poor 
                little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, 
                no doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thenardiers; 
                those peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect my duty 
                towards all these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce 
                myself; and I was about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let 
                us put it at the worst:</p>
              <p> 　　suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and 
                that my conscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, 
                for the good of others, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; 
                this evil action which compromises my soul alone; in that lies 
                self-sacrifice; in that alone there is virtue.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be 
                content.</p>
              <p> 　　Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths 
                are found only in the depths of thought.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him, that, after having descended into these 
                depths, after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows, 
                he had at last found one of these diamonds, one of these truths, 
                and that he now held it in his hand, and he was dazzled as he 
                gazed upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;this is right; I am on 
                the right road; I have the solution; I must end by holding fast 
                to something; my resolve is taken; let things take their course; 
                let us no longer vacillate; let us no longer hang back; this is 
                for the interest of all, not for my own; I am Madeleine, and Madeleine 
                I remain.</p>
              <p> 　　Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!</p>
              <p> 　　I am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know 
                anything; it turns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present 
                moment; let him look out for himself; that does not concern me; 
                it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night; if 
                it halts and descends on a head, so much the worse for that head.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, 
                and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am 
                quite another man now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come!&quot; he said, &quot;I must not flinch before 
                any of the consequences of the resolution which I have once adopted; 
                there are still threads which attach me to that Jean Valjean; 
                they must be broken; in this very room there are objects which 
                would betray me, dumb things which would bear witness against 
                me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and 
                took out a small key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture 
                could hardly be seen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones 
                of the design which covered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle 
                opened, a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between 
                the wall and the chimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were 
                some rags-- a blue linen blouse, an old pair of trousers, an old 
                knapsack, and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who had seen Jean Valjean at the epoch when he passed 
                through D---- in October, 1815, could easily have recognized all 
                the pieces of this miserable outfit.</p>
              <p> 　　He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, 
                in order to remind himself continually of his starting-point, 
                but he had concealed all that came from the galleys, and he had 
                allowed the candlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared 
                that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, 
                with a quick and abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms 
                at once, without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which 
                he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many 
                years, and flung them all, rags, cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　He closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions, 
                henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the 
                door behind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front 
                of it.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite 
                wall were lighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything was on fire; the thorn cudgel snapped and threw 
                out sparks to the middle of the chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags 
                which it contained, it revealed something which sparkled in the 
                ashes. By bending over, one could have readily recognized a coin,--no 
                doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with 
                the same step.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which 
                shone vaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hold!&quot; he thought; &quot;the whole of Jean Valjean 
                is still in them. They must be destroyed also.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He seized the two candlesticks.</p>
              <p> 　　There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out 
                of shape, and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.</p>
              <p> 　　He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt a sense of real comfort.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How good warmth is!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.</p>
              <p> 　　A minute more, and they were both in the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within 
                him shouting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Jean Valjean!</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His hair rose upright:</p>
              <p> 　　he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's it! finish!&quot; said the voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Complete what you are about!</p>
              <p> 　　Destroy these candlesticks!</p>
              <p> 　　Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop!</p>
              <p> 　　Forget everything!</p>
              <p> 　　Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right!</p>
              <p> 　　Applaud yourself!</p>
              <p> 　　So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed:</p>
              <p> 　　here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him, 
                who has, perhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, whose whole misfortune 
                lies in your name, upon whom your name weighs like a crime, who 
                is about to be taken for you, who will be condemned, who will 
                finish his days in abjectness and horror.</p>
              <p> 　　That is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le 
                Maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish 
                the indigent; rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; 
                and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joy 
                and light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, 
                who will bear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain 
                in the galleys.</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, it is well arranged thus.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah, wretch!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The perspiration streamed from his brow.</p>
              <p> 　　He fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks.</p>
              <p> 　　But that within him which had spoken had not finished.</p>
              <p> 　　The voice continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, 
                which will make a great noise, which will talk very loud, and 
                which will bless you, and only one which no one will hear, and 
                which will curse you in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　Well! listen, infamous man!</p>
              <p> 　　All those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven, 
                and only the malediction will ascend to God.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from 
                the most obscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become 
                startling and formidable, and he now heard it in his very ear.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that it had detached itself from him, and 
                that it was now speaking outside of him.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that 
                he glanced around the room in a sort of terror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there any one here?&quot; he demanded aloud, in utter 
                bewilderment.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How stupid I am!</p>
              <p> 　　There can be no one!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was some one; but the person who was there was of those 
                whom the human eye cannot see.</p>
              <p> 　　He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which 
                troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke 
                him with a start.</p>
              <p> 　　This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated 
                him. It sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people 
                moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that 
                they may encounter by change of place.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position.</p>
              <p> 　　He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions 
                at which he had arrived in turn.</p>
              <p> 　　The two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally 
                fatal.</p>
              <p> 　　What a fatality!</p>
              <p> 　　What conjunction that that Champmathieu should have been taken 
                for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which Providence 
                seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen his position!</p>
              <p> 　　There was a moment when he reflected on the future.</p>
              <p> 　　Denounce himself, great God!</p>
              <p> 　　Deliver himself up!</p>
              <p> 　　With immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged 
                to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was 
                so good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, 
                to liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never 
                more hear the birds sing in the month of May; he should never 
                more bestow alms on the little children; he should never more 
                experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love 
                fixed upon him; he should quit that house which he had built, 
                that little chamber!</p>
              <p> 　　Everything seemed charming to him at that moment.</p>
              <p> 　　Never again should he read those books; never more should 
                he write on that little table of white wood; his old portress, 
                the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his 
                coffee in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron necklet, 
                the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, 
                the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well!</p>
              <p> 　　At his age, after having been what he was! If he were only 
                young again! but to be addressed in his old age as &quot;thou&quot; 
                by any one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; to 
                receive the galley-sergeant's cudgellings; to wear iron-bound 
                shoes on his bare feet; to have to stretch out his leg night and 
                morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang; to 
                submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be told:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was 
                mayor of M. sur M.&quot;; and at night, dripping with perspiration, 
                overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps drawn over their 
                eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the galleys 
                beneath the sergeant's whip. Oh, what misery!</p>
              <p> 　　Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, 
                and become as monstrous as the human heart?</p>
              <p> 　　And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending 
                dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Should he remain in paradise and become a demon?</p>
              <p> 　　Should he return to hell and become an angel?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　What was to be done?</p>
              <p> 　　Great God! what was to be done?</p>
              <p> 　　The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty 
                was unchained afresh within him.</p>
              <p> 　　His ideas began to grow confused once more; they assumed a 
                kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to 
                despair.</p>
              <p> 　　The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his mind, 
                with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, 
                where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.</p>
              <p> 　　He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone.</p>
              <p> 　　At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort 
                to recover the mastery of his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　He tried to put to himself, for the last time, and definitely, 
                the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallen prostrate with 
                fatigue:</p>
              <p> 　　Ought he to denounce himself?</p>
              <p> 　　Ought he to hold his peace?</p>
              <p> 　　He could not manage to see anything distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　The vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had 
                been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished, one 
                after the other, into smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　He only felt that, to whatever course of action he made up 
                his mind, something in him must die, and that of necessity, and 
                without his being able to escape the fact; that he was entering 
                a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left; that he 
                was passing through a death agony,-- the agony of his happiness, 
                or the agony of his virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. 
                He was no further advanced than at the beginning.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen 
                hundred years before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being 
                in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings 
                of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand, while the 
                olive-trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite, the terrible 
                cup which appeared to Him dripping with darkness and overflowing 
                with shadows in the depths all studded with stars.</p>

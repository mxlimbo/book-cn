              <p> 　　A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE</p>
              <p> 　　Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent 
                of the Petit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured 
                to open a window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit 
                us one other little digression, utterly foreign to this book, 
                but characteristic and useful, since it shows that the cloister 
                even has its original figures.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from 
                the Abbey of Fontevrault.</p>
              <p> 　　She had even been in society before the Revolution. She talked 
                a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis 
                XVI.</p>
              <p> 　　and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very 
                intimate.</p>
              <p> 　　It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names 
                on every pretext.</p>
              <p> 　　She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,-- that it was 
                like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.</p>
              <p> 　　She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils.</p>
              <p> 　　Every year, she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment 
                of taking the oath, she said to the priest, &quot;Monseigneur 
                Saint-Francois gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur 
                Saint-Julien gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur 
                Saint-Eusebius gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; 
                and thus I give it to you, father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, 
                but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs which made 
                the vocal mothers frown.</p>
              <p> 　　On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories.</p>
              <p> 　　She said that in her youth the Bernardine monks were every 
                whit as good as the mousquetaires.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth 
                century.</p>
              <p> 　　She told about the custom of the four wines, which existed 
                before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a great 
                personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, 
                traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came 
                out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas 
                into which they had poured four different sorts of wine. On the 
                first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; on the 
                second, lion wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog 
                wine.</p>
              <p> 　　These four legends express the four stages descended by the 
                drunkard; the first, intoxication, which enlivens; the second, 
                that which irritates; the third, that which dulls; and the fourth, 
                that which brutalizes.</p>
              <p> 　　In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object 
                of which she thought a great deal.</p>
              <p> 　　The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this.</p>
              <p> 　　She would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself 
                up, which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time 
                that she desired to contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in 
                the corridor, she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was 
                possible with her aged hands.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she 
                who was so fond of talking.</p>
              <p> 　　The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most 
                tenacious by her obstinacy.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were 
                unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could that treasure of 
                the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret?</p>
              <p> 　　Some holy book, no doubt?</p>
              <p> 　　Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic?</p>
              <p> 　　They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman 
                died, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, 
                perhaps, and opened it.</p>
              <p> 　　They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some 
                consecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter representing little 
                Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous 
                syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the charming little Loves is already fairly spitted.</p>
              <p> 　　He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making 
                an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical 
                air.</p>
              <p> 　　Moral:</p>
              <p> 　　Love conquered by the colic.</p>
              <p> 　　This platter, which is very curious, and which had, possibly, 
                the honor of furnishing Moliere with an idea, was still in existence 
                in September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-a-brac merchant 
                in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.</p>
              <p> 　　This good old woman would not receive any visits from outside 
                because, said she, the parlor is too gloomy.</p>

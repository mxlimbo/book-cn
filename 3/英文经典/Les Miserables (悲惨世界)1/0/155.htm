              <p> 　　THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF 
                INDIA</p>
              <p> 　　 The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. 
                One might almost say:</p>
              <p> 　　Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.</p>
              <p> 　　This word gamin was printed for the first time, and reached 
                popular speech through the literary tongue, in 1834.</p>
              <p> 　　It is in a little work entitled Claude Gueux that this word 
                made its appearance. The horror was lively.</p>
              <p> 　　The word passed into circulation.</p>
              <p> 　　The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins 
                for each other are very various.</p>
              <p> 　　We have known and associated with one who was greatly respected 
                and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top 
                of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded 
                in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of 
                the dome of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and 
                had &quot;prigged&quot; some lead from them; a third, because 
                he had seen a diligence tip over; still another, because he &quot;knew&quot; 
                a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen.</p>
              <p> 　　This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, 
                a profound epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without 
                comprehending,--Dieu de Dieu!</p>
              <p> 　　What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seen 
                anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I'ave 
                and fifth pronounced fift'.)</p>
              <p> 　　Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father So-and-So, your wife has died of her malady; 
                why did you not send for the doctor?&quot; &quot;What would you 
                have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves.&quot; But if the peasant's 
                whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the free-thinking 
                anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly, contained 
                in this other saying.</p>
              <p> 　　A man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in 
                the tumbrel.</p>
              <p> 　　The child of Paris exclaims: &quot;He is talking to his black 
                cap!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, the sneak!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. 
                To be strong-minded is an important item.</p>
              <p> 　　To be present at executions constitutes a duty.</p>
              <p> 　　He shows himself at the guillotine, and he laughs.</p>
              <p> 　　He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The End of the Soup, 
                The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last Mouthful, 
                etc., etc.</p>
              <p> 　　In order not to lose anything of the affair, he scales the 
                walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he suspends 
                himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof 
                inspires him with no more fear than a mast.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the 
                Place de Greve. Samson and the Abbe Montes are the truly popular 
                names.</p>
              <p> 　　They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him.</p>
              <p> 　　They sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing 
                the hideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain 
                a future:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was jealous of him.&quot; In the brotherhood of gamins 
                Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. &quot;Politicians&quot; 
                are confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition 
                as to everybody's last garment.</p>
              <p> 　　It is known that Tolleron had a fireman's cap, Avril an otter 
                cap, Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bare-headed, 
                that Castaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had 
                a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, 
                that Lecouffe and his mother quarrelled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't reproach each other for your basket,&quot; shouted 
                a gamin to them.</p>
              <p> 　　Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, 
                and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern 
                on the quay and climbed it.</p>
              <p> 　　A gendarme stationed opposite frowned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me climb up, m'sieu le gendarme,&quot; said the 
                gamin.</p>
              <p> 　　And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added: &quot;I 
                will not fall.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't care if you do,&quot; retorted the gendarme.</p>
              <p> 　　In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts 
                for a great deal.</p>
              <p> 　　One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to 
                cut one's self very deeply, &quot;to the very bone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The fist is no mediocre element of respect.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am fine and strong, come now!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　To be left-handed renders you very enviable.</p>
              <p> 　　A squint is highly esteemed.</p>

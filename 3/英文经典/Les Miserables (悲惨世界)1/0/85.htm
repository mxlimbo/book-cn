              <p> 　　THE CATASTROPHE</p>
              <p> 　　The rout behind the Guard was melancholy.</p>
              <p> 　　The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,--Hougomont, 
                La Haie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit.</p>
              <p> 　　The cry &quot;Treachery!&quot; was followed by a cry of &quot;Save 
                yourselves who can!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An army which is disbanding is like a thaw.</p>
              <p> 　　All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles, 
                hastens, is precipitated.</p>
              <p> 　　The disintegration is unprecedented.</p>
              <p> 　　Ney borrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, 
                or sword, places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both 
                English and French.</p>
              <p> 　　He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, 
                he insults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers fly from him, shouting, &quot;Long live Marshal 
                Ney!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two of Durutte's regiments go and come in affright as though 
                tossed back and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and the 
                fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, and Rylandt; the 
                worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat; friends kill each 
                other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions break and disperse 
                against each other, like the tremendous foam of battle.</p>
              <p> 　　Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn 
                into the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is 
                left to him of his Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort 
                his last serviceable squadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, 
                Kellermann before Vandeleur, Lobau before Bulow, Morand before 
                Pirch, Domon and Subervic before Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, 
                who led the Emperor's squadrons to the charge, falls beneath the 
                feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops past the line of 
                fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreats them.</p>
              <p> 　　All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, &quot;Long 
                live the Emperor!&quot; remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. 
                The Prussian cavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, 
                slashes, kills, exterminates.</p>
              <p> 　　Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of the artillery-train 
                unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape; 
                transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog the 
                road and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others 
                walk over the dead and the living.</p>
              <p> 　　Arms are lost.</p>
              <p> 　　A dizzy multitude fills the roads, the paths, the bridges, 
                the plains, the hills, the valleys, the woods, encumbered by this 
                invasion of forty thousand men. Shouts despair, knapsacks and 
                guns flung among the rye, passages forced at the point of the 
                sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no more generals, an 
                inexpressible terror.</p>
              <p> 　　Zieten putting France to the sword at its leisure.</p>
              <p> 　　Lions converted into goats.</p>
              <p> 　　Such was the flight.</p>
              <p> 　　At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present 
                a battle front, to draw up in line.</p>
              <p> 　　Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance to the village 
                was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian canister, 
                all took to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That volley of 
                grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of 
                a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes' distance 
                before you enter Genappe.</p>
              <p> 　　The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no doubt, 
                that they were not more entirely the conquerors.</p>
              <p> 　　The pursuit was stupendous. Blucher ordered extermination.</p>
              <p> 　　Roguet had set the lugubrious example of threatening with 
                death any French grenadier who should bring him a Prussian prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　Blucher outdid Roguet.</p>
              <p> 　　Duhesme, the general of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the 
                doorway of an inn at Genappe, surrendered his sword to a huzzar 
                of death, who took the sword and slew the prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　The victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us inflict punishment, since we are history: old Blucher 
                disgraced himself.</p>
              <p> 　　This ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster.</p>
              <p> 　　The desperate route traversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras, 
                traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversed 
                Thuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was 
                fleeing in that manner?</p>
              <p> 　　The Grand Army.</p>
              <p> 　　This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the 
                loftiest bravery which ever astounded history,--is that causeless? 
                No. The shadow of an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. 
                It is the day of destiny.</p>
              <p> 　　The force which is mightier than man produced that day.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those 
                great souls surrendering their swords.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who had conquered Europe have fallen prone on the earth, 
                with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the present shadow 
                of a terrible presence. Hoc erat in fatis.</p>
              <p> 　　That day the perspective of the human race underwent a change.</p>
              <p> 　　Waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance 
                of the great man was necessary to the advent of the great century.</p>
              <p> 　　Some one, a person to whom one replies not, took the responsibility 
                on himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The panic of heroes can be explained. In the battle of Waterloo 
                there is something more than a cloud, there is something of the 
                meteor.</p>
              <p> 　　God has passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　At nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand 
                seized by the skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, 
                sinister, gloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of 
                the rout, had just dismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse 
                over his arm, and with wild eye was returning alone to Waterloo.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Napoleon, the immense somnambulist of this dream which 
                had crumbled, essaying once more to advance.</p>

              <p> 　　 In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment 
                of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted 
                women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine 
                instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes 
                of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking 
                in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe 
                in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame 
                the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood.</p>
              <p> 　　This letter is in our possession. </p>
              <p> 　　D----, Dec. 16, 18--. MY GOOD MADAM:</p>
              <p> 　　Not a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established 
                custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while 
                washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has 
                made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique 
                paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style 
                of yours.</p>
              <p> 　　Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things 
                beneath.</p>
              <p> 　　My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we 
                use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet 
                in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly 
                painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered 
                with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was 
                of the era of our grandmothers.</p>
              <p> 　　But my room is the one you ought to see.</p>
              <p> 　　Madam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses 
                of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good 
                are very tolerable.</p>
              <p> 　　The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some 
                gardens, the name of which escapes me.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.</p>
              <p> 　　What shall I say to you?</p>
              <p> 　　I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible 
                word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all 
                off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, 
                and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.</p>
              <p> 　　She has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables 
                of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each 
                to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the 
                poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer 
                a round table of mahogany.</p>
              <p> 　　I am always very happy.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother is so good.</p>
              <p> 　　He gives all he has to the poor and sick.</p>
              <p> 　　We are very much cramped.</p>
              <p> 　　The country is trying in the winter, and we really must do 
                something for those who are in need.</p>
              <p> 　　We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that 
                these are great treats.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother has ways of his own.</p>
              <p> 　　When he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so.</p>
              <p> 　　Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever 
                chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He 
                fears nothing, even at night.</p>
              <p> 　　That is his sort of bravery, he says.</p>
              <p> 　　He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. 
                He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like 
                to have us even seem to notice it.</p>
              <p> 　　One must know how to understand him.</p>
              <p> 　　He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels 
                in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, 
                nor night.</p>
              <p> 　　Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers.</p>
              <p> 　　He would not take us.</p>
              <p> 　　He was absent for a fortnight.</p>
              <p> 　　On his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought 
                to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, &quot;This is the 
                way I have been robbed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels 
                of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.</p>
              <p> 　　When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from 
                scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except 
                when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear 
                me.</p>
              <p> 　　At first I used to say to myself, &quot;There are no dangers 
                which will stop him; he is terrible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam 
                Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he 
                sees fit.</p>
              <p> 　　I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for 
                him and fall asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　I am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen 
                to him, it would be the end of me.</p>
              <p> 　　I should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　It has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to 
                accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences.</p>
              <p> 　　But now the habit has been acquired.</p>
              <p> 　　We pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　If the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed 
                to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　After all, what is there for us to fear in this house?</p>
              <p> 　　There is always some one with us who is stronger than we.</p>
              <p> 　　The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.</p>
              <p> 　　This suffices me.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me.</p>
              <p> 　　I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves 
                to the care of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　That is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur 
                of soul.</p>
              <p> 　　I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information 
                which you desire on the subject of the Faux family.</p>
              <p> 　　You are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, 
                because he is still a very good royalist.</p>
              <p> 　　They really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship 
                of Caen.</p>
              <p> 　　Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de 
                Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom 
                was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, 
                and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse 
                of Bretagne.</p>
              <p> 　　His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, 
                son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the 
                French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army.</p>
              <p> 　　It is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.</p>
              <p> 　　Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, 
                Monsieur the Cardinal.</p>
              <p> 　　As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting 
                the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.</p>
              <p> 　　She is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.</p>
              <p> 　　That is all that I desire.</p>
              <p> 　　The souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, 
                and it makes me very happy.</p>
              <p> 　　My health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every 
                day.</p>
              <p> 　　Farewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave 
                you.</p>
              <p> 　　A thousand good wishes. </p>
              <p> 　　 BAPTISTINE.</p>
              <p> 　　 P.S. Your grand nephew is charming.</p>
              <p> 　　Do you know that he will soon be five years old?</p>
              <p> 　　Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on 
                knee-caps, and he said, &quot;What has he got on his knees?&quot; 
                He is a charming child!</p>
              <p> 　　His little brother is dragging an old broom about the room, 
                like a carriage, and saying, &quot;Hu!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood 
                how to mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special 
                feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends 
                himself. The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid 
                air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, 
                bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion 
                of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, 
                but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with 
                him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain moments, without his having occasion to mention 
                it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, 
                so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting 
                as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the 
                house.</p>
              <p> 　　They served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, 
                they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable delicacy 
                of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, 
                I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that 
                they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her 
                brother's end would prove her own.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.</p>

              <p> 　　END OF THE BRIGAND</p>
              <p> 　　 The conclusion of Marius' classical studies coincided with 
                M. Gillenormand's departure from society.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man bade farewell to the Faubourg Saint-Germain and 
                to Madame de T.'s salon, and established himself in the Mardis, 
                in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. There he had for 
                servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid, Nicolette, 
                who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and pursy 
                Basque, who have been mentioned above.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year.</p>
              <p> 　　One evening, on his return home, he saw his grandfather holding 
                a letter in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marius,&quot; said M. Gillenormand, &quot;you will set 
                out for Vernon to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To see your father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was seized with a trembling fit.</p>
              <p> 　　He had thought of everything except this--that he should one 
                day be called upon to see his father. Nothing could be more unexpected, 
                more surprising, and, let us admit it, more disagreeable to him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was forcing estrangement into reconciliation.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant duty.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, 
                was convinced that his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand 
                called him on his amiable days, did not love him; this was evident, 
                since he had abandoned him to others.</p>
              <p> 　　Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing is more simple,&quot; he said to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. 
                The grandfather resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It appears that he is ill.</p>
              <p> 　　He demands your presence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And after a pause, he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Set out to-morrow morning.</p>
              <p> 　　I think there is a coach which leaves the Cour des Fontaines 
                at six o'clock, and which arrives in the evening. Take it.</p>
              <p> 　　He says that here is haste.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into 
                his pocket. Marius might have set out that very evening and have 
                been with his father on the following morning.</p>
              <p> 　　A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi took the trip to Rouen 
                by night at that date, and passed through Vernon.</p>
              <p> 　　Neither Marius nor M.Gillenormand thought of making inquiries 
                about it.</p>
              <p> 　　The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon.</p>
              <p> 　　People were just beginning to light their candles.</p>
              <p> 　　He asked the first person whom be met for &quot;M. Pontmercy's 
                house.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　For in his own mind, he agreed with the Restoration, and like 
                it, did not recognize his father's claim to the title of either 
                colonel or baron.</p>
              <p> 　　The house was pointed out to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He rang; a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the 
                door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;M. Pontmercy?&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The woman remained motionless.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this his house?&quot; demanded Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The woman nodded affirmatively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can I speak with him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The woman shook her head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I am his son!&quot; persisted Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is expecting me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He no longer expects you,&quot; said the woman.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he perceived that she was weeping.</p>
              <p> 　　She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he 
                entered.</p>
              <p> 　　In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing 
                on the chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, 
                another kneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in 
                his shirt.</p>
              <p> 　　The one on the floor was the colonel.</p>
              <p> 　　The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged 
                in prayer.</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. 
                As he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, 
                he had written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son.</p>
              <p> 　　The malady had grown worse.</p>
              <p> 　　On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, the colonel 
                had had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite 
                of the servant's efforts to prevent him, crying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My son is not coming!</p>
              <p> 　　I shall go to meet him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor 
                of the antechamber.</p>
              <p> 　　He had just expired.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor had been summoned, and the cure.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor had arrived too late.</p>
              <p> 　　The son had also arrived too late.</p>
              <p> 　　By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished 
                on the pale and prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled 
                from his dead eye.</p>
              <p> 　　The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry.</p>
              <p> 　　That tear was his son's delay.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, 
                on that venerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw 
                not, on those white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here 
                and there, brown lines, marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red 
                stars, which indicated bullet-holes, were visible.</p>
              <p> 　　He contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on 
                that countenance upon which God had imprinted goodness.</p>
              <p> 　　He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man 
                was dead, and a chill ran over him.</p>
              <p> 　　The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have 
                felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold 
                stretched out in death.</p>
              <p> 　　Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　The servant-woman was lamenting in a corner, the cure was 
                praying, and his sobs were audible, the doctor was wiping his 
                eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the 
                midst of their affliction without uttering a word; he was the 
                stranger there.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and 
                embarrassed at his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; 
                and he dropped it on the floor, in order to produce the impression 
                that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised 
                himself for behaving in this manner.</p>
              <p> 　　But was it his fault?</p>
              <p> 　　He did not love his father?</p>
              <p> 　　Why should he!</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel had left nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　The sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his 
                burial.</p>
              <p> 　　The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. 
                It contained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field 
                of Waterloo.</p>
              <p> 　　Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which 
                I purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That 
                he will be worthy of it is a matter of course.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Below, the colonel had added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my 
                life. The man's name was Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　I think that he has recently been keeping a little inn, in 
                a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can to Thenardier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to 
                his father, but because of that vague respect for death which 
                is always imperious in the heart of man.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing remained of the colonel.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an old-clothes 
                dealer.</p>
              <p> 　　The neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare 
                flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　The other plants turned to nettles and weeds, and died.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon.</p>
              <p> 　　After the interment he returned to Paris, and applied himself 
                again to his law studies, with no more thought of his father than 
                if the latter had never lived. In two days the colonel was buried, 
                and in three forgotten.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius wore crape on his hat.</p>
              <p> 　　That was all.</p>

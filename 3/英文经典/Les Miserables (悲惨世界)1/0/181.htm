              <p> 　　THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN</p>
              <p> 　　 One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius 
                was present and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable 
                shock to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　This took place in the back room of the Cafe Musain.</p>
              <p> 　　Nearly all the Friends of the A B C had convened that evening.</p>
              <p> 　　The argand lamp was solemnly lighted.</p>
              <p> 　　They talked of one thing and another, without passion and 
                with noise.</p>
              <p> 　　With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held their 
                peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations 
                between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　They tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn.</p>
              <p> 　　They were chattering in all quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the 
                dish-washer of the cafe, who passed through it from time to time, 
                to go to her washing in the &quot;lavatory.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which 
                he had taken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top 
                of his lungs, and shouting:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am thirsty.</p>
              <p> 　　Mortals, I am dreaming:</p>
              <p> 　　that the tun of Heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy, and 
                that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it.</p>
              <p> 　　I want a drink.</p>
              <p> 　　I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of I 
                know not whom.</p>
              <p> 　　It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　One breaks one's neck in living. Life is a theatre set in 
                which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an 
                antique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says:</p>
              <p> 　　`All is vanity.'</p>
              <p> 　　I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps.</p>
              <p> 　　Zero not wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity.</p>
              <p> 　　O vanity!</p>
              <p> 　　The patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is 
                a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, 
                a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker 
                is an artist, a hodman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, 
                a wood-louse is a pterigybranche.</p>
              <p> 　　Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, 
                it is the negro with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, 
                it is the philosopher with his rags.</p>
              <p> 　　I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are called 
                honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally 
                of pinchbeck.</p>
              <p> 　　Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made a horse 
                a consul; Charles II.</p>
              <p> 　　made a knight of a sirloin.</p>
              <p> 　　Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet 
                Roastbeef.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable 
                in the least.</p>
              <p> 　　Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor.</p>
              <p> 　　White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what 
                a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating 
                of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise I would quote 
                to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have 
                always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing 
                wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples; 
                rapin[24] is the masculine of rapine.</p>
              <p> 　　So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you are worth 
                no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, 
                and qualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy 
                borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, 
                the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very 
                pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue 
                as there are holes in Diogenes' cloak.</p>
              <p> 　　Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Caesar or Brutus?</p>
              <p> 　　Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live Brutus, 
                he has slain!</p>
              <p> 　　There lies the virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　Virtue, granted, but madness also.</p>
              <p> 　　There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who killed 
                Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue 
                was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also 
                carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, 
                which Nero carried with him in his travels.</p>
              <p> 　　This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and 
                Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with the 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　All history is nothing but wearisome repetition.</p>
              <p> 　　One century is the plagiarist of the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac 
                of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other 
                as two drops of water.</p>
              <p> 　　I don't attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid 
                as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove 
                something!</p>
              <p> 　　If you are content with success, what mediocrity, and with 
                conquering, what wretchedness!</p>
              <p> 　　Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says 
                Horace.</p>
              <p> 　　Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the 
                party at all?</p>
              <p> 　　Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?</p>
              <p> 　　What people, if you please?</p>
              <p> 　　Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days 
                gone by, slew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon 
                tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His urine attracts the bees.&quot; The most prominent 
                man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who 
                was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes 
                with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood 
                on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and 
                catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What 
                did Episthates do?</p>
              <p> 　　He invented a trip.</p>
              <p> 　　That sums up Greece and glory.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us pass on to others.</p>
              <p> 　　Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France?</p>
              <p> 　　France?</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because of Paris?</p>
              <p> 　　I have just told you my opinion of Athens.</p>
              <p> 　　England?</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because of London? I hate Carthage.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters 
                of wretchedness.</p>
              <p> 　　There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish 
                of Charing-Cross alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is Albion. I add, as the climax, that I have seen an 
                Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　A fig then for England! If I do not admire John Bull, shall 
                I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding 
                brother.</p>
              <p> 　　Take away Time is money, what remains of England?</p>
              <p> 　　Take away Cotton is king, what remains of America?</p>
              <p> 　　Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into 
                ecstasies over Russia?</p>
              <p> 　　Voltaire admired it.</p>
              <p> 　　He also admired China.</p>
              <p> 　　I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, a stout 
                despotism; but I pity the despots.</p>
              <p> 　　Their health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded 
                Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, 
                divers Ivans strangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases 
                and Basils poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the 
                Emperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity.</p>
              <p> 　　All civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration 
                of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and sums 
                up all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros 
                in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians 
                in the Doubtful Pass. `Bah!' you will say to me, `but Europe is 
                certainly better than Asia?' I admit that Asia is a farce; but 
                I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand 
                Lama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions 
                and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from 
                the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the 
                Dauphin.</p>
              <p> 　　Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it!</p>
              <p> 　　It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm 
                the most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the 
                most gin, at London the most wine, at Constantinople the most 
                coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are all the useful notions.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers 
                are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of 
                the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Piraeus.</p>
              <p> 　　Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickers are 
                called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House. 
                Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, mastroquets, 
                bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers, caravanseries 
                of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat at 
                Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to 
                roll naked Cleopatra in!</p>
              <p> 　　Where is Cleopatra?</p>
              <p> 　　Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　So it is you, Louison.</p>
              <p> 　　Good day.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 [24] The slang term for a painter's assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　 Thus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, 
                catching at the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in 
                the back room of the Cafe Musain.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence 
                on him, and Grantaire began again worse than ever:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws.</p>
              <p> 　　You produce on me no effect with your gesture of Hippocrates 
                refusing Artaxerxes' bric-a-brac. I excuse you from the task of 
                soothing me.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish me to say to you?</p>
              <p> 　　Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a success, 
                man is a failure.</p>
              <p> 　　God made a mistake with that animal.</p>
              <p> 　　A crowd offers a choice of ugliness. The first comer is a 
                wretch, Femme--woman--rhymes with infame,-- infamous.</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, I have the spleen, complicated with melancholy, with 
                homesickness, plus hypochondria, and I am vexed and I rage, and 
                I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired to death, and I am stupid! 
                Let God go to the devil!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Silence then, capital R!&quot; resumed Bossuet, who 
                was discussing a point of law behind the scenes, and who was plunged 
                more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang, of which this 
                is the conclusion:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;--And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and 
                at the most, an amateur attorney, I maintain this:</p>
              <p> 　　that, in accordance with the terms of the customs of Normandy, 
                at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an equivalent must be paid 
                to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving the rights of others, 
                and by all and several, the proprietors as well as those seized 
                with inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses, leases, freeholds, 
                contracts of domain, mortgages--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Echo, plaintive nymph,&quot; hummed Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　Near Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, 
                an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced 
                that a vaudeville was being sketched out.</p>
              <p> 　　This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and 
                the two heads at work touched each other:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us begin by finding names. When one has the names, 
                one finds the subject.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is true.</p>
              <p> 　　Dictate.</p>
              <p> 　　I will write.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Dorimon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An independent gentleman?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His daughter, Celestine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;--tine.</p>
              <p> 　　What next?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Colonel Sainval.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sainval is stale.</p>
              <p> 　　I should say Valsin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was 
                also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing 
                a duel. An old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of 
                eighteen, and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had 
                to deal with.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The deuce!</p>
              <p> 　　Look out for yourself.</p>
              <p> 　　He is a fine swordsman.</p>
              <p> 　　His play is neat.</p>
              <p> 　　He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, 
                a just parade, mathematical parries, bigre! and he is left-handed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing 
                dominoes, and talking of love.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are in luck, that you are,&quot; Joly was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have a mistress who is always laughing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is a fault of hers,&quot; returned Bahorel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One's mistress does wrong to laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　That encourages one to deceive her.</p>
              <p> 　　To see her gay removes your remorse; if you see her sad, your 
                conscience pricks you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing!</p>
              <p> 　　And you never quarrel!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is because of the treaty which we have made.</p>
              <p> 　　On forming our little Holy Alliance we assigned ourselves 
                each our frontier, which we never cross.</p>
              <p> 　　What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on 
                the side of the wind to Gex.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the peace.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peace is happiness digesting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement 
                with Mamselle-- you know whom I mean?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She sulks at me with cruel patience.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Alas!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In your place, I would let her alone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is easy enough to say.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Is not her name Musichetta?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, 
                with tiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and 
                dimpled, with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must 
                be elegant, and produce effects with your knees.</p>
              <p> 　　Buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at Staub's. 
                That will assist.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At what price?&quot; shouted Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. 
                Pagan mythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The 
                question was about Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, 
                out of pure romanticism.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose.</p>
              <p> 　　Once excited, he burst forth, a sort of mirth accentuated 
                his enthusiasm, and he was at once both laughing and lyric.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us not insult the gods,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The gods may not have taken their departure.</p>
              <p> 　　Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are dreams, 
                you say.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the flight 
                of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths.</p>
              <p> 　　Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like 
                the Vignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; 
                it has not been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to 
                breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the 
                holes in turn with his fingers, and I have always believed that 
                Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the last corner, they were talking politics.</p>
              <p> 　　The Charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre was upholding it weakly.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the 
                table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac 
                had seized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments 
                the rattling of this sheet of paper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the first place, I won't have any kings; if it were 
                only from an economical point of view, I don't want any; a king 
                is a parasite.</p>
              <p> 　　One does not have kings gratis.</p>
              <p> 　　Listen to this: the dearness of kings.</p>
              <p> 　　At the death of Francois I., the national debt of France amounted 
                to an income of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis 
                XIV.</p>
              <p> 　　it was two milliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight 
                livres the mark, which was equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, 
                to four milliards, five hundred millions, which would to-day be 
                equivalent to twelve milliards.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter 
                granted is but a poor expedient of civilization.</p>
              <p> 　　To save the transition, to soften the passage, to deaden the 
                shock, to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy 
                to democracy by the practice of constitutional fictions,--what 
                detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us never enlighten 
                the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale in 
                your constitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no 
                grant from the king to the people. In all such grants there is 
                an Article 14.</p>
              <p> 　　By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which 
                snatches back.</p>
              <p> 　　I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the 
                lie lurks beneath it. A people which accepts a charter abdicates.</p>
              <p> 　　The law is only the law when entire.</p>
              <p> 　　No! no charter!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. 
                This was tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist.</p>
              <p> 　　He crumpled the poor Touquet Charter in his fist, and flung 
                it in the fire. The paper flashed up.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burn philosophically, 
                and contented himself with saying:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The charter metamorphosed into flame.&quot;</p>
              <p>And sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called 
                entrain, and that English thing which is called humor, good and 
                bad taste, good and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of 
                dialogue, mounting together and crossing from all points of the 
                room, produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads.</p>

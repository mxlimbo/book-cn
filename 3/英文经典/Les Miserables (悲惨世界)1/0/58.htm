              <p> 　　A TEMPEST IN A SKULL</p>
              <p> 　　 The reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine 
                is no other than Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; 
                the moment has now come when we must take another look into it. 
                We do so not without emotion and trepidation.</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort 
                of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find more 
                dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it can fix itself 
                on no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, 
                more mysterious, and more infinite.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a spectacle more grand than the sea; it is heaven:</p>
              <p> 　　there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is the inmost 
                recesses of the soul.</p>
              <p> 　　To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with 
                reference to a single man, were it only in connection with the 
                basest of men, would be to blend all epics into one superior and 
                definitive epic. Conscience is the chaos of chimeras, of lusts, 
                and of temptations; the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of 
                which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is 
                the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at certain hours, 
                past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection, 
                and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　There, beneath that external silence, battles of giants, like 
                those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons 
                and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, 
                as in Dante.</p>
              <p> 　　What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears 
                within him, and which he measures with despair against the caprices 
                of his brain and the actions of his life!</p>
              <p> 　　Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before 
                which he hesitated.</p>
              <p> 　　Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let 
                us enter, nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　We have but little to add to what the reader already knows 
                of what had happened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with 
                Little Gervais. From that moment forth he was, as we have seen, 
                a totally different man. What the Bishop had wished to make of 
                him, that he carried out. It was more than a transformation; it 
                was a transfiguration.</p>
              <p> 　　He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving 
                only the candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, 
                traversed France, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which 
                we have mentioned, accomplished what we have related, succeeded 
                in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible, and, 
                thenceforth, established at M. sur M., happy in feeling his conscience 
                saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied 
                by the last, he lived in peace, reassured and hopeful, having 
                henceforth only two thoughts,--to conceal his name and to sanctify 
                his life; to escape men and to return to God.</p>
              <p> 　　These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind 
                that they formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing 
                and imperative and ruled his slightest actions.</p>
              <p> 　　In general, they conspired to regulate the conduct of his 
                life; they turned him towards the gloom; they rendered him kindly 
                and simple; they counselled him to the same things.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, however, they conflicted.</p>
              <p> 　　In that case, as the reader will remember, the man whom all 
                the country of M. sur M. called M. Madeleine did not hesitate 
                to sacrifice the first to the second--his security to his virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, he 
                had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning for him, 
                summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed 
                that way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, 
                and saved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations 
                of Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought, 
                following the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and 
                just, that his first duty was not towards himself.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like 
                this had yet presented itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose 
                sufferings we are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. 
                He understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first 
                words pronounced by Javert, when the latter entered his study.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when that name, which he had buried beneath 
                so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he was struck with 
                stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity 
                of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which 
                precedes great shocks.</p>
              <p> 　　He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier 
                at the approach of an assault.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending 
                upon his head. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which 
                occurred to him was to go, to run and denounce himself, to take 
                that Champmathieu out of prison and place himself there; this 
                was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh.</p>
              <p> 　　Then it passed away, and he said to himself, &quot;We will 
                see!</p>
              <p> 　　We will see!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He repressed this first, generous instinct, and recoiled before 
                heroism.</p>
              <p> 　　It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop's holy words, 
                after so many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst 
                of a penitence admirably begun, if this man had not flinched for 
                an instant, even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture, 
                but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning 
                precipice, at the bottom of which lay heaven; that would have 
                been beautiful; but it was not thus.</p>
              <p> 　　We must render an account of the things which went on in this 
                soul, and we can only tell what there was there. He was carried 
                away, at first, by the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied 
                all his ideas in haste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration 
                Javert's presence, that great danger, postponed all decision with 
                the firmness of terror, shook off thought as to what he had to 
                do, and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind 
                within, a profound tranquillity without.</p>
              <p> 　　He took no &quot;preservative measures,&quot; as they may 
                be called.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything was still confused, and jostling together in his 
                brain.</p>
              <p> 　　His trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form 
                of a single idea distinctly, and he could have told nothing about 
                himself, except that he had received a great blow.</p>
              <p> 　　He repaired to Fantine's bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged 
                his visit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he 
                must behave thus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case 
                he should be obliged to be absent himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to Arras; 
                and without having the least in the world made up his mind to 
                this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was, beyond the 
                shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the way 
                in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the 
                tilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.</p>
              <p> 　　He dined with a good deal of appetite.</p>
              <p> 　　On returning to his room, he communed with himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so 
                unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from his 
                chair, moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted 
                his door.</p>
              <p> 　　He feared lest something more should enter. He was barricading 
                himself against possibilities.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.</p>
              <p> 　　lt seemed to him as though he might be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　By whom?</p>
              <p> 　　Alas!</p>
              <p> 　　That on which he desired to close the door had already entered; 
                that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,-- 
                his conscience.</p>
              <p> 　　His conscience; that is to say, God.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling 
                of security and of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself 
                impregnable; the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he took possession of himself:</p>
              <p> 　　he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hand, 
                and began to meditate in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where do I stand?</p>
              <p> 　　Am not I dreaming?</p>
              <p> 　　What have I heard?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it really true that I have seen that Javert, and that he 
                spoke to me in that manner?</p>
              <p> 　　Who can that Champmathieu be?</p>
              <p> 　　So he resembles me! Is it possible?</p>
              <p> 　　When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far 
                from suspecting anything!</p>
              <p> 　　What was I doing yesterday at this hour?</p>
              <p> 　　What is there in this incident?</p>
              <p> 　　What will the end be? What is to be done?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This was the torment in which he found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　His brain had lost its power of retaining ideas; they passed 
                like waves, and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which 
                overwhelmed his will and his reason, and from which he sought 
                to draw proof and resolution.</p>
              <p> 　　His head was burning.</p>
              <p> 　　He went to the window and threw it wide open. There were no 
                stars in the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　He returned and seated himself at the table.</p>
              <p> 　　The first hour passed in this manner.</p>
              <p> 　　Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and 
                to fix themselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch 
                a glimpse with precision of the reality,--not the whole situation, 
                but some of the details.</p>
              <p> 　　He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and extraordinary 
                as was this situation, he was completely master of it.</p>
              <p> 　　This only caused an increase of his stupor.</p>
              <p> 　　Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had 
                assigned to his actions, all that he had made up to that day had 
                been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name.</p>
              <p> 　　That which he had always feared most of all in his hours of 
                self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to ever hear 
                that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would 
                be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name 
                made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from 
                about him, and--who knows?-- perhaps even his new soul within 
                him, also.</p>
              <p> 　　He shuddered at the very thought that this was possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Assuredly, if any one had said to him at such moments that 
                the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears, when 
                the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would suddenly emerge from the 
                darkness and rise in front of him, when that formidable light, 
                capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself, 
                would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that that name 
                would not menace him, that that light would but produce an obscurity 
                more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the mystery, 
                that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this prodigious 
                incident would have no other result, so far as he was concerned, 
                if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his existence 
                at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his confrontation 
                with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy citizen 
                Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful, and 
                more respected than ever--if any one had told him that, he would 
                have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, all this was precisely what had just come to pass; all 
                that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted 
                these wild fancies to become real things!</p>
              <p> 　　His revery continued to grow clearer.</p>
              <p> 　　He came more and more to an understanding of his position.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable 
                dream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in 
                the middle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in 
                vain, on the very brink of the abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger, a man 
                unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and whom she 
                was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf 
                might close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself 
                or that other man, should fall into it: he had only let things 
                take their course.</p>
              <p> 　　The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: 
                That his place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, 
                it was still awaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais 
                had led him back to it; that this vacant place would await him, 
                and draw him on until he filled it; that this was inevitable and 
                fatal; and then he said to himself, &quot;that, at this moment, 
                be had a substitute; that it appeared that a certain Champmathieu 
                had that ill luck, and that, as regards himself, being present 
                in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, present in 
                society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to 
                fear, provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the 
                head of that Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the 
                stone of the sepulchre, falls once, never to rise again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly 
                took place in him that indescribable movement, which no man feels 
                more than two or three times in the course of his life, a sort 
                of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there 
                is doubtful in the heart, which is composed of irony, of joy, 
                and of despair, and which may be called an outburst of inward 
                laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　He hastily relighted his candle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what then?&quot; he said to himself; &quot;what 
                am I afraid of? What is there in all that for me to think about?</p>
              <p> 　　I am safe; all is over.</p>
              <p> 　　I had but one partly open door through which my past might 
                invade my life, and behold that door is walled up forever! That 
                Javert, who has been annoying me so long; that terrible instinct 
                which seemed to have divined me, which had divined me-- good God! 
                and which followed me everywhere; that frightful hunting-dog, 
                always making a point at me, is thrown off the scent, engaged 
                elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail:</p>
              <p> 　　henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he 
                has his Jean Valjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will 
                wish to leave town! And all this has been brought about without 
                any aid from me, and I count for nothing in it!</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my honor, people 
                would think, to see me, that some catastrophe had happened to 
                me!</p>
              <p> 　　After all, if it does bring harm to some one, that is not 
                my fault in the least:</p>
              <p> 　　it is Providence which has done it all; it is because it wishes 
                it so to be, evidently.</p>
              <p> 　　Have I the right to disarrange what it has arranged?</p>
              <p> 　　What do I ask now? Why should I meddle?</p>
              <p> 　　It does not concern me; what!</p>
              <p> 　　I am not satisfied: but what more do I want?</p>
              <p> 　　The goal to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream 
                of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,--security,--I 
                have now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against 
                the will of God, and why does God will it? In order that I may 
                continue what I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one 
                day be a grand and encouraging example, that it may be said at 
                last, that a little happiness has been attached to the penance 
                which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I have returned.</p>
              <p> 　　Really, I do not understand why I was afraid, a little while 
                ago, to enter the house of that good cure, and to ask his advice; 
                this is evidently what he would have said to me: It is settled; 
                let things take their course; let the good God do as he likes!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, 
                bending over what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his 
                chair, and began to pace the room:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;let us think no more about 
                it; my resolve is taken!&quot; but he felt no joy.</p>
              <p> 　　Quite the reverse.</p>
              <p> 　　One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea 
                than one can the sea from returning to the shore:</p>
              <p> 　　the sailor calls it the tide; the guilty man calls it remorse; 
                God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.</p>
              <p> 　　After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he 
                resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he 
                who listened, saying that which he would have preferred to ignore, 
                and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear, 
                yielding to that mysterious power which said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Think!&quot; as it said to another condemned man, two 
                thousand years ago, &quot;March on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves 
                fully understood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.</p>
              <p> 　　It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is 
                no living being who has not done it.</p>
              <p> 　　It may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent 
                mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a 
                man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is in 
                this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, 
                he said, he exclaimed, must be understood; one speaks to one's 
                self, talks to one's self, exclaims to one's self without breaking 
                the external silence; there is a great tumult; everything about 
                us talks except the mouth.</p>
              <p> 　　The realities of the soul are none the less realities because 
                they are not visible and palpable.</p>
              <p> 　　So he asked himself where he stood.</p>
              <p> 　　He interrogated himself upon that &quot;settled resolve.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged 
                in his mind was monstrous, that &quot;to let things take their 
                course, to let the good God do as he liked,&quot; was simply horrible; 
                to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not 
                to hinder it, to lend himself to it through his silence, to do 
                nothing, in short, was to do everything! that this was hypocritical 
                baseness in the last degree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, 
                abject, hideous crime!</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just 
                tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.</p>
              <p> 　　He spit it out with disgust.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to question himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He asked himself severely what he had meant by this, &quot;My 
                object is attained!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He declared to himself that his life really had an object; 
                but what object? To conceal his name?</p>
              <p> 　　To deceive the police?</p>
              <p> 　　Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had 
                done?</p>
              <p> 　　Had he not another and a grand object, which was the true 
                one--to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and 
                good once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that 
                alone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined 
                upon him--to shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting 
                it! great God! he was re-opening it by committing an infamous 
                action!</p>
              <p> 　　He was becoming a thief once more, and the most odious of 
                thieves!</p>
              <p> 　　He was robbing another of his existence, his life, his peace, 
                his place in the sunshine. He was becoming an assassin.</p>
              <p> 　　He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched man.</p>
              <p> 　　He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, that 
                death beneath the open sky, which is called the galleys. On the 
                other hand, to surrender himself to save that man, struck down 
                with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, to become 
                once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, in 
                truth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that 
                hell whence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance 
                was to escape from it in reality.</p>
              <p> 　　This must be done!</p>
              <p> 　　He had done nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life 
                was useless; all his penitence was wasted.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no longer any need of saying, &quot;What is the 
                use?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that the Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present 
                all the more because he was dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly 
                at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, 
                would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean 
                would be pure and admirable in his sight; that men beheld his 
                mask, but that the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life, 
                but that the Bishop beheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, 
                deliver the false Jean Valjean, and denounce the real one.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas! that was the greatest of sacrifices, the most poignant 
                of victories, the last step to take; but it must be done. Sad 
                fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God when 
                he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, said he, &quot;let us decide upon this; let us 
                do our duty; let us save this man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that he was 
                speaking aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He 
                flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty 
                and embarrassed tradesmen.</p>
              <p> 　　He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might 
                have been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment, 
                To Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d'Artois, Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　He drew from his secretary a pocket-book which contained several 
                bank-notes and the passport of which he had made use that same 
                year when he went to the elections.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various 
                acts, into which there entered such grave thought, would have 
                had no suspicion of what was going on within him.</p>
              <p> 　　Only occasionally did his lips move; at other times he raised 
                his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall, as though 
                there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate 
                or interrogate.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it 
                into his pocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his 
                walk once more.</p>
              <p> 　　His revery had not swerved from its course.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to see his duty clearly, written in luminous 
                letters, which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as 
                he altered the direction of his glance:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go!</p>
              <p> 　　Tell your name!</p>
              <p> 　　Denounce yourself!&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　 The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had 
                converted his carriage into alms.</p>
              <p> 　　The diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are very few 
                plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have 
                just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two 
                hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels.</p>
              <p> 　　To visit all these is quite a task.</p>
              <p> 　　The Bishop managed to do it.</p>
              <p> 　　He went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted 
                spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains.</p>
              <p> 　　The two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard 
                for them, he went alone.</p>
              <p> 　　One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal 
                city. He was mounted on an ass.</p>
              <p> 　　His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit 
                him any other equipage.</p>
              <p> 　　The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the 
                town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of the citizens were laughing around him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur the Mayor,&quot; said the Bishop, &quot;and 
                Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you.</p>
              <p> 　　You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal 
                which was used by Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p> 　　I have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from 
                vanity.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and 
                talked rather than preached.</p>
              <p> 　　He never went far in search of his arguments and his examples.</p>
              <p> 　　He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of 
                a neighboring district.</p>
              <p> 　　In the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred 
                on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows 
                mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their 
                houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it 
                is a country which is blessed by God.</p>
              <p> 　　For a whole century, there has not been a single murderer 
                among them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: 
                &quot;Look at the people of Embrun!</p>
              <p> 　　If, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his 
                son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service 
                in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends 
                him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the 
                mass, all the inhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go 
                to the poor man's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry 
                his straw and his grain to his granary.&quot; To families divided 
                by questions of money and inheritance he said: &quot;Look at the 
                mountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale 
                is not heard there once in fifty years.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to 
                seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that 
                they may find husbands.&quot; To the cantons which had a taste 
                for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped 
                paper, he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras!</p>
              <p> 　　There are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like 
                a little republic.</p>
              <p> 　　Neither judge nor bailiff is known there.</p>
              <p> 　　The mayor does everything.</p>
              <p> 　　He allots the imposts, taxes each person conscientiously, 
                judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without charge, 
                pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he 
                is a just man among simple men.&quot; To villages where he found 
                no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know how they manage?&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths 
                cannot always support a teacher, they have school-masters who 
                are paid by the whole valley, who make the round of the villages, 
                spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and instruct them.</p>
              <p> 　　These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there.</p>
              <p> 　　They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear 
                in the cord of their hat.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach 
                reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, 
                reckoning, and Latin have three pens.</p>
              <p> 　　But what a disgrace to be ignorant!</p>
              <p> 　　Do like the people of Queyras!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, 
                he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases 
                and many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence 
                of Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p> 　　And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.</p>

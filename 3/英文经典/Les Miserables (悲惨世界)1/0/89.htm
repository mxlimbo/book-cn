              <p> 　　IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?</p>
              <p> 　　 There exists a very respectable liberal school which does 
                not hate Waterloo.</p>
              <p> 　　We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefied 
                date of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an 
                egg is certainly unexpected.</p>
              <p> 　　If one places one's self at the culminating point of view 
                of the question, Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary 
                victory.</p>
              <p> 　　It is Europe against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and 
                Vienna against Paris; it is the statu quo against the initiative; 
                it is the 14th of July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 
                1815; it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to 
                the indomitable French rioting. The final extinction of that vast 
                people which had been in eruption for twenty-six years--such was 
                the dream.</p>
              <p> 　　The solidarity of the Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, 
                the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs with the Bourbons.</p>
              <p> 　　Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper.</p>
              <p> 　　It is true, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom 
                by the natural reaction of things, was forced to be liberal, and 
                that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of Waterloo, 
                to the great regret of the conquerors.</p>
              <p> 　　It is because revolution cannot be really conquered, and that 
                being providential and absolutely fatal, it is always cropping 
                up afresh:</p>
              <p> 　　before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones; 
                after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the 
                charter.</p>
              <p> 　　Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and 
                a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate 
                equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration 
                of the rights of man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution 
                is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the 
                nature of progress, call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work 
                irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. It always 
                reaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, 
                who was only a soldier, an orator.</p>
              <p> 　　Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the tribune. Thus 
                does progress proceed.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman.</p>
              <p> 　　It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine 
                work the man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering 
                invalid of Father Elysee.</p>
              <p> 　　It makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror; 
                of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within.</p>
              <p> 　　Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones 
                by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary 
                work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; 
                it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was 
                intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory 
                was vanquished by liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; 
                that which smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him 
                all the marshals' staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the 
                staff of a marshal of France; that which joyously trundled the 
                barrows full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which 
                triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date &quot;June 18, 
                1815&quot;; that which encouraged Blucher, as he put the flying 
                army to the sword; that which, from the heights of the plateau 
                of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over its prey, was 
                the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution which murmured 
                that infamous word &quot;dismemberment.&quot; On arriving in Paris, 
                it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which 
                scorched its feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the 
                stammer of a charter.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. 
                Of intentional liberty there is none.</p>
              <p> 　　The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal, in the same 
                manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon was involuntarily 
                revolutionary.</p>
              <p> 　　On the 18th of June, 1815, the mounted Robespierre was hurled 
                from his saddle.</p>

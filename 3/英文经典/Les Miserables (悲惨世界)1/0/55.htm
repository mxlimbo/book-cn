              <p> 　　HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP</p>
              <p> 　　 One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging 
                in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office, 
                in case he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when 
                he was informed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking 
                with him.</p>
              <p> 　　Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression 
                on hearing this name.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of 
                the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Admit him,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert entered.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, 
                his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, 
                and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for 
                the infraction of police regulations.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not disturb himself on Javert's account.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited 
                him to be glacial in his manner.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back 
                was turned to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this 
                docket.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, 
                without breaking the silence.</p>
              <p> 　　If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and 
                who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of 
                civilization, this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, 
                the monk, and the corporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, 
                this unspotted police agent--if any physiognomist had known his 
                secret and long-cherished aversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict 
                with the mayor on the subject of Fantine, and had examined Javert 
                at that moment, he would have said to himself, &quot;What has 
                taken place?&quot; It was evident to any one acquainted with that 
                clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferocious conscience, 
                that Javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his 
                countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　Like violent people in general, he was subject to abrupt changes 
                of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling. 
                On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in which there 
                was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces 
                in the rear of the mayor's arm-chair, and there he stood, perfectly 
                erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous 
                roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always 
                been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without making 
                a movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm, 
                serious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which 
                was half-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his 
                officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge, until it 
                should please the mayor to turn round.</p>
              <p> 　　All the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might 
                have attributed to him had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　That face, as impenetrable and simple as granite, no longer 
                bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable 
                courageous despondency.</p>
              <p> 　　At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well!</p>
              <p> 　　What is it?</p>
              <p> 　　What is the matter, Javert?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting 
                his ideas, then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, 
                which did not, however, preclude simplicity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been 
                committed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What act?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, 
                and in the gravest manner, towards a magistrate.</p>
              <p> 　　I have come to bring the fact to your knowledge, as it is 
                my duty to do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is the agent?&quot; asked M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I,&quot; said Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain 
                of the agent?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You, Mr. Mayor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine sat erect in his arm-chair. Javert went on, with 
                a severe air and his eyes still cast down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the 
                authorities to dismiss me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert interrupted him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, 
                but that does not suffice.</p>
              <p> 　　Handing in one's resignation is honorable. I have failed in 
                my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And after a pause he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and 
                unjustly. Be so to-day, with justice.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, now!</p>
              <p> 　　Why?&quot; exclaimed M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What nonsense is this? What is the meaning of this?</p>
              <p> 　　What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me?</p>
              <p> 　　What have you done to me?</p>
              <p> 　　What are your wrongs with regard to me?</p>
              <p> 　　You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Turned out,&quot; said Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Turned out; so it be, then.</p>
              <p> 　　That is well.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not understand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, 
                still coldly and sadly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene 
                over that woman, I was furious, and I informed against you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Informed against me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener 
                than Javert himself, burst out laughing now:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the 
                police?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As an ex-convict.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The mayor turned livid.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I thought it was so.</p>
              <p> 　　I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance; inquiries 
                which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength of 
                your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in 
                marksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;-- I hardly know 
                what all,--absurdities!</p>
              <p> 　　But, at all events, I took you for a certain Jean Valjean.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A certain--What did you say the name was?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty 
                years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On 
                leaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed 
                a bishop; then he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, 
                on a public highway on the person of a little Savoyard.</p>
              <p> 　　He disappeared eight years ago, no one knows how, and he has 
                been sought, I fancied. In short, I did this thing!</p>
              <p> 　　Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments 
                before this, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what reply did you receive?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That I was mad.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, they were right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is lucky that you recognize the fact.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has 
                been found.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped 
                from his hand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and 
                said with his indescribable accent:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor.</p>
              <p> 　　It seems that there was in the neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher 
                an old fellow who was called Father Champmathieu.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any attention 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　No one knows what such people subsist on.</p>
              <p> 　　Lately, last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for 
                the theft of some cider apples from--Well, no matter, a theft 
                had been committed, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. My 
                Champmathieu was arrested.</p>
              <p> 　　He still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　The scamp is locked up.</p>
              <p> 　　Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor.</p>
              <p> 　　But here is where Providence intervened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate 
                finds it convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the 
                departmental prison is situated.</p>
              <p> 　　In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, 
                who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed 
                turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no 
                sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: `Eh! Why, 
                I know that man!</p>
              <p> 　　He is a fagot![4] Take a good look at me, my good man!</p>
              <p> 　　You are Jean Valjean!'</p>
              <p> 　　`Jean Valjean! who's Jean Valjean?' Champmathieu feigns astonishment.</p>
              <p> 　　`Don't play the innocent dodge,' says Brevet.</p>
              <p> 　　`You are Jean Valjean!</p>
              <p> 　　You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years 
                ago; we were there together.' Champmathieu denies it.</p>
              <p> 　　Parbleu!</p>
              <p> 　　You understand.</p>
              <p> 　　The case is investigated.</p>
              <p> 　　The thing was well ventilated for me.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what they discovered:</p>
              <p> 　　This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of 
                trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all 
                trace of him was lost.</p>
              <p> 　　A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then 
                in Paris, where he is said to have been a wheelwright, and to 
                have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but that has not been 
                proved.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what was Jean 
                Valjean?</p>
              <p> 　　A pruner of trees.</p>
              <p> 　　Where?</p>
              <p> 　　At Faverolles. Another fact.</p>
              <p> 　　This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's surname 
                was Mathieu.</p>
              <p> 　　What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the 
                galleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose 
                of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu?</p>
              <p> 　　He goes to Auvergne.</p>
              <p> 　　The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan--he is called 
                Chan Mathieu.</p>
              <p> 　　Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed into 
                Champmathieu.</p>
              <p> 　　You follow me, do you not?</p>
              <p> 　　Inquiries were made at Faverolles.</p>
              <p> 　　The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not known where they have gone. You know that among 
                those classes a family often disappears. Search was made, and 
                nothing was found.</p>
              <p> 　　When such people are not mud, they are dust.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty years 
                back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Inquiries were made at Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who 
                have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and 
                are sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted 
                with the pretended Champmathieu.</p>
              <p> 　　They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as well 
                as for Brevet.</p>
              <p> 　　The same age,--he is fifty-four,-- the same height, the same 
                air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this 
                moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　I was told that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean 
                is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can imagine 
                whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same 
                Jean Valjean here.</p>
              <p> 　　I write to the examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu 
                is conducted to me--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 [4] An ex-convict.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;Well?&quot; interposed M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy 
                as ever:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　I am sorry; but that man is Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　I recognized him also.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are sure?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes 
                from profound conviction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O!</p>
              <p> 　　Sure!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking 
                pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl 
                which stood on the table, and he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, 
                I do not see how I could have thought otherwise.</p>
              <p> 　　I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words 
                to the man, who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence 
                of the whole station-house, and bade him &quot;leave the room,&quot;--Javert, 
                that haughty man, was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,--M. 
                Madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what does this man say?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it's a bad business.</p>
              <p> 　　If he is Jean Valjean, he has his previous conviction against 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　To climb a wall, to break a branch, to purloin apples, is 
                a mischievous trick in a child; for a man it is a misdemeanor; 
                for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and housebreaking--it is 
                all there.</p>
              <p> 　　It is no longer a question of correctional police; it is a 
                matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no longer a matter of a 
                few days in prison; it is the galleys for life.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who 
                will return, I hope.</p>
              <p> 　　The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is there 
                not?</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly 
                dog.</p>
              <p> 　　That is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have 
                felt that things were getting hot for him; he would struggle, 
                he would cry out--the kettle sings before the fire; he would not 
                be Jean Valjean, et cetera.</p>
              <p> 　　But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, `I 
                am Champmathieu, and I won't depart from that!'</p>
              <p> 　　He has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is 
                far better.</p>
              <p> 　　Oh! the rogue is clever!</p>
              <p> 　　But it makes no difference. The proofs are there.</p>
              <p> 　　He has been recognized by four persons; the old scamp will 
                be condemned.</p>
              <p> 　　The case has been taken to the Assizes at Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　I shall go there to give my testimony.</p>
              <p> 　　I have been summoned.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his 
                docket, and was turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and 
                writing by turns, like a busy man.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned to Javert:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That will do, Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　In truth, all these details interest me but little.</p>
              <p> 　　We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the 
                woman Buseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. 
                You will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter 
                Pierre Chesnelong.</p>
              <p> 　　The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman and 
                her child.</p>
              <p> 　　He must be punished.</p>
              <p> 　　You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. 
                He complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which 
                discharges rain-water on his premises, and is undermining the 
                foundations of his house. After that, you will verify the infractions 
                of police regulations which have been reported to me in the Rue 
                Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame 
                Renee le Bosse's, and you will prepare documents.</p>
              <p> 　　But I am giving you a great deal of work. Are you not to be 
                absent?</p>
              <p> 　　Did you not tell me that you were going to Arras on that matter 
                in a week or ten days?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On what day, then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire 
                that the case was to be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set 
                out by diligence to-night.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how long will the case last?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One day, at the most.</p>
              <p> 　　The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow evening at latest.</p>
              <p> 　　But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; I 
                shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is well,&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert did not withdraw.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it now?&quot; demanded M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must 
                remind you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That I must be dismissed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine rose.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you.</p>
              <p> 　　You exaggerate your fault.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you 
                deserve promotion instead of degradation.</p>
              <p> 　　I wish you to retain your post.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose 
                depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience 
                seemed visible, and said in a tranquil voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I repeat,&quot; replied M. Madeleine, &quot;that the 
                matter concerns me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the way I reason:</p>
              <p> 　　I have suspected you unjustly.</p>
              <p> 　　That is nothing. It is our right to cherish suspicion, although 
                suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse.</p>
              <p> 　　But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object of wreaking 
                my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict, you, a respectable 
                man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious.</p>
              <p> 　　I have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the 
                authorities!</p>
              <p> 　　If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I should 
                have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him.</p>
              <p> 　　Well?</p>
              <p> 　　Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in 
                the course of my life towards others. That is just.</p>
              <p> 　　I have done well.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice 
                that I have done would become injustice. Ought I to spare myself 
                more than others?</p>
              <p> 　　No!</p>
              <p> 　　What!</p>
              <p> 　　I should be good for nothing but to chastise others, and not 
                myself!</p>
              <p> 　　Why, I should be a blackguard!</p>
              <p> 　　Those who say, `That blackguard of a Javert!' would be in 
                the right.</p>
              <p> 　　Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that you should treat me kindly; 
                your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed 
                to others.</p>
              <p> 　　I want none of it for myself. The kindness which consists 
                in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police 
                agent against the mayor, the man who is down against the man who 
                is up in the world, is what I call false kindness. That is the 
                sort of kindness which disorganizes society.</p>
              <p> 　　Good God! it is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies 
                in being just. Come! if you had been what I thought you, I should 
                not have been kind to you, not I!</p>
              <p> 　　You would have seen!</p>
              <p> 　　Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat any other 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　When I have subdued malefactors, when I have proceeded with 
                vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, `If you flinch, 
                if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!'</p>
              <p> 　　I have flinched, I have caught myself in a fault. So much 
                the worse!</p>
              <p> 　　Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled!</p>
              <p> 　　That is well. I have arms.</p>
              <p> 　　I will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, 
                the good of the service demands an example.</p>
              <p> 　　I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced 
                tone, which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall see,&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　And he offered him his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be.</p>
              <p> 　　A mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He added between his teeth:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused 
                the police. I am no more than a police spy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the 
                door.</p>
              <p> 　　There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor,&quot; he said, &quot;I shall continue to 
                serve until I am superseded.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He withdrew.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm, 
                sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.</p>

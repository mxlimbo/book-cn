              <p>　　THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY</p>
              <p>　　That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other.All 
                nature seemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing.The flower-beds 
                of Saint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled 
                the leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees 
                pillaged the jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped 
                down upon the yarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the 
                august park of the King of France there was a pack of vagabonds, 
                the birds.</p>
              <p>　　The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the 
                flowers, the trees, were resplendent.</p>
              <p>　　And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, 
                dancing, chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their 
                pink, open-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without 
                malice, all received, to some extent, the kisses of all, with 
                the exception of Fantine, who was hedged about with that vague 
                resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness, and who 
                was in love.&quot;You always have a queer look about you,&quot; 
                said Favourite to her.</p>
              <p>　　Such things are joys.</p>
              <p>　　These passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life 
                and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from everything.</p>
              <p>　　There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly 
                for those in love,--in that eternal hedge-school of lovers, which 
                is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there 
                are hedges and scholars.Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers.</p>
              <p>　　The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, 
                the limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used 
                to say in olden times, all are subjects of this fairy.</p>
              <p>　　They laugh and hunt, and there is in the air the brilliance 
                of an apotheosis--what a transfiguration effected by love!</p>
              <p>　　Notaries' clerks are gods.</p>
              <p>　　And the little cries, the pursuits through the grass, the waists 
                embraced on the fly, those jargons which are melodies, those adorations 
                which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those 
                cherries torn from one mouth by another,--all this blazes forth 
                and takes its place among the celestial glories.</p>
              <p>　　Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly.</p>
              <p>　　They think that this will never come to an end.Philosophers, 
                poets, painters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to 
                make of it, so greatly are they dazzled by it.</p>
              <p>　　The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter 
                of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away 
                into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these 
                love idyls, and d'Urfe mingles druids with them.</p>
              <p>　　After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called 
                the King's Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose 
                name escapes our memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, 
                was attracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming 
                shrub with a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and 
                leafless and as fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny 
                white rosettes; this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair 
                studded with flowers.There was always an admiring crowd about 
                it.</p>
              <p>　　After viewing the shrub, Tholomyes exclaimed, &quot;I offer 
                you asses!&quot; and having agreed upon a price with the owner 
                of the asses, they returned by way of Vanvres and Issy.</p>
              <p>　　At Issy an incident occurred.The truly national park, at that 
                time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened to be wide open.</p>
              <p>　　They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in his 
                grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet 
                of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire 
                or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus.They had stoutly shaken 
                the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the 
                Abbe de Bernis.</p>
              <p>　　As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing 
                folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to 
                his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyes, who 
                was somewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, 
                sang, to a melancholy chant, the old ballad gallega, probably 
                inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope 
                between two trees:-- </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Soy de Badajoz, </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Badajoz is my home, </p>
              <p>　　 Amor me llama, </p>
              <p>　　And Love is my name; </p>
              <p>　　 Toda mi alma, </p>
              <p>　　 To my eyes in flame, </p>
              <p>　　 Es en mi ojos, </p>
              <p>　　All my soul doth come; </p>
              <p>　　 Porque ensenas,</p>
              <p>　　 For instruction meet </p>
              <p>　　 A tuas piernas. </p>
              <p>　　 I receive at thy feet&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Fantine alone refused to swing.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I don't like to have people put on airs like that,&quot; 
                muttered Favourite, with a good deal of acrimony.</p>
              <p>　　After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed 
                the Seine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached 
                the barrier of l'Etoile. They had been up since five o'clock that 
                morning, as the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such 
                thing as fatigue on Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue 
                does not work.</p>
              <p>　　About three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, 
                were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which 
                then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line 
                was visible above the trees of the Champs Elysees.</p>
              <p>　　From time to time Favourite exclaimed:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;And the surprise?</p>
              <p>　　I claim the surprise.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Patience,&quot; replied Tholomyes.</p>

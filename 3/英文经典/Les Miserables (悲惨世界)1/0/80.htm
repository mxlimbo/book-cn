              <p> 　　THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE</p>
              <p> 　　So, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.</p>
              <p> 　　He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as 
                we have seen, really admirable.</p>
              <p> 　　The battle once begun, its very various changes,--the resistance 
                of Hougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; 
                the disabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye's 
                brigade was shattered; Guilleminot's fatal heedlessness when he 
                had neither petard nor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; 
                the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; 
                the small effect of the bombs falling in the English lines, and 
                there embedding themselves in the rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding 
                in producing volcanoes of mud, so that the canister was turned 
                into a splash; the uselessness of Pire's demonstration on Braine-l'Alleud; 
                all that cavalry, fifteen squadrons, almost exterminated; the 
                right wing of the English badly alarmed, the left wing badly cut 
                into; Ney's strange mistake in massing, instead of echelonning 
                the four divisions of the first corps; men delivered over to grape-shot, 
                arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep and with a frontage of two 
                hundred; the frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon-balls; 
                attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenly unmasked 
                on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and Durutte compromised; 
                Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at the 
                Polytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was beating 
                in with an axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright 
                fire of the English barricade which barred the angle of the road 
                from Genappe to Brussels; Marcognet's division caught between 
                the infantry and the cavalry, shot down at the very muzzle of 
                the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack, put to the sword by 
                Ponsonby; his battery of seven pieces spiked; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar 
                holding and guarding, in spite of the Comte d'Erlon, both Frischemont 
                and Smohain; the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the 45th 
                captured; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the 
                flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between 
                Wavre and Plancenoit; the alarming things that had been said by 
                prisoners; Grouchy's delay; fifteen hundred men killed in the 
                orchard of Hougomont in less than an hour; eighteen hundred men 
                overthrown in a still shorter time about La Haie-Sainte,--all 
                these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of battle before 
                Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze and had not overshadowed 
                that face of imperial certainty. Napoleon was accustomed to gaze 
                steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details, 
                cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that 
                they furnished the total, victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings 
                did go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor 
                at the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of 
                the question, and he treated destiny as his equal:</p>
              <p> 　　he seemed to say to fate, Thou wilt not dare.</p>
              <p> 　　Composed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought 
                himself protected in good and tolerated in evil.</p>
              <p> 　　He had, or thought that he had, a connivance, one might almost 
                say a complicity, of events in his favor, which was equivalent 
                to the invulnerability of antiquity.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, when one has Beresina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau 
                behind one, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A 
                mysterious frown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. 
                He suddenly beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, 
                and the van of the English army disappear.</p>
              <p> 　　It was rallying, but hiding itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor half rose in his stirrups. The lightning of victory 
                flashed from his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes 
                and destroyed--that was the definitive conquest of England by 
                France; it was Crecy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. 
                The man of Marengo was wiping out Agincourt.</p>
              <p> 　　So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, 
                swept his glass for the last time over all the points of the field 
                of battle.</p>
              <p> 　　His guard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched 
                him from below with a sort of religion.</p>
              <p> 　　He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the declivities, 
                scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the path; 
                he seemed to be counting each bush.</p>
              <p> 　　He gazed with some intentness at the English barricades of 
                the two highways,--two large abatis of trees, that on the road 
                to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon, the only 
                ones out of all the English artillery which commanded the extremity 
                of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles where 
                gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chasse's brigade.</p>
              <p> 　　Near this barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, 
                painted white, which stands at the angle of the cross-road near 
                Braine-l'Alleud; he bent down and spoke in a low voice to the 
                guide Lacoste.</p>
              <p> 　　The guide made a negative sign with his head, which was probably 
                perfidious.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　Wellington had drawn back.</p>
              <p> 　　All that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at 
                full speed to Paris to announce that the battle was won.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.</p>
              <p> 　　He had just found his clap of thunder.</p>
              <p> 　　He gave orders to Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the table-land 
                of Mont-Saint-Jean.</p>

              <p> 　　IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                　　On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare 
                passers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to 
                an old-fashioned hearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, 
                and tears. This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white 
                cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse 
                with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, in which could be seen a 
                priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed.</p>
              <p> 　　Two undertaker's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked 
                on the right and the left of the hearse.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who 
                limped along.</p>
              <p> 　　The procession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard 
                cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the 
                antennae of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the 
                man's pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries 
                of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance 
                and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung 
                tenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavaliere 
                and the porte pietonne.[16] The Bernardines-Benedictines of the 
                Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, 
                to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of 
                land having formerly belonged to their community.</p>
              <p> 　　The grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening 
                in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery, they were 
                subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the Paris cemeteries 
                closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal 
                regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated 
                gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and 
                inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　These gates, therefore, swung inexorably on their hinges at 
                the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides.</p>
              <p> 　　If any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the 
                cemetery, there was but one way for him to get out-- his grave-digger's 
                card furnished by the department of public funerals. A sort of 
                letter-box was constructed in the porter's window. The grave-digger 
                dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, pulled 
                the rope, and the small door opened.</p>
              <p> 　　If the man had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, 
                who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified 
                the man, and opened the gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped 
                out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                　　[16] Instead of porte cochere and porte batarde.</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, 
                embarrassed the symmetry of the administration.</p>
              <p> 　　It was suppressed a little later than 1830.</p>
              <p> 　　The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the Eastern cemetery, 
                succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop next to the 
                Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted on 
                a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers' 
                tables, and the other on the tombs, with this sign: Au Bon Coing.</p>
              <p> 　　The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. 
                It was falling into disuse.</p>
              <p> 　　Dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the 
                Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty.</p>
              <p> 　　Pere-Lachaise if you please! to be buried in Pere-Lachaise 
                is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany.</p>
              <p> 　　It is recognized as elegant.</p>
              <p> 　　The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted 
                like an old-fashioned French garden.</p>
              <p> 　　Straight alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath 
                aged cypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was 
                tragic there.</p>
              <p> 　　There were very lugubrious lines about it.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall 
                and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. 
                The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the 
                altar, the exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to 
                the dead-room,-- all had been executed without difficulty, and 
                there had been no hitch.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion 
                under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in 
                our sight.</p>
              <p> 　　It is one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had 
                committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause 
                of their own consciences.</p>
              <p> 　　In the cloister, what is called the &quot;government&quot; 
                is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which 
                is always questionable.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see.</p>
              <p> 　　Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves.</p>
              <p> 　　The tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of 
                the tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented 
                frame of mind.</p>
              <p> 　　His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent, 
                the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, 
                to all appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities 
                which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as 
                to his success.</p>
              <p> 　　What remained to be done was a mere nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Within the last two years, he had made good Father Mestienne, 
                a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at least ten times.</p>
              <p> 　　He played with Father Mestienne.</p>
              <p> 　　He did what he liked with him.</p>
              <p> 　　He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne's head 
                adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will. Fauchelevent's 
                confidence was perfect.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to 
                the cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and 
                said half aloud, as he rubbed his big hands:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here's a fine farce!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　The permission for interment must be exhibited.</p>
              <p> 　　The undertaker's man addressed himself to the porter of the 
                cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　During this colloquy, which always is productive of a delay 
                of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came and placed 
                himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large 
                pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you?&quot; he demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The man replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The grave-digger.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the 
                breast, he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The grave-digger?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He was.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　He was?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is dead.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger 
                could die.</p>
              <p> 　　It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows 
                out one's own.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open.</p>
              <p> 　　He had hardly the strength to stammer:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it is not possible!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But,&quot; he persisted feebly, &quot;Father Mestienne 
                is the grave-digger.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;After Napoleon, Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my name is Gribier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man.</p>
              <p> 　　He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent burst out laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said he, &quot;what queer things do happen!</p>
              <p> 　　Father Mestienne is dead, but long live little Father Lenoir!</p>
              <p> 　　Do you know who little Father Lenoir is?</p>
              <p> 　　He is a jug of red wine.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a jug of Surene, morbigou! of real Paris Surene?</p>
              <p> 　　Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he was a jolly 
                fellow.</p>
              <p> 　　But you are a jolly fellow, too.</p>
              <p> 　　Are you not, comrade?</p>
              <p> 　　We'll go and have a drink together presently.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have been a student.</p>
              <p> 　　I passed my fourth examination. I never drink.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand 
                alley of the cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent had slackened his pace.</p>
              <p> 　　He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.</p>
              <p> 　　The grave-digger walked on in front of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.</p>
              <p> 　　He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air 
                of age, and who, though slender, are extremely strong.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Comrade!&quot; cried Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　The man turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am the convent grave-digger.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My colleague,&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood 
                that he had to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine 
                talker. He muttered:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So Father Mestienne is dead.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Completely.</p>
              <p> 　　The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the 
                time is up.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Father Mestienne's turn.</p>
              <p> 　　Father Mestienne died.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent repeated mechanically:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The good God--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The good God,&quot; said the man authoritatively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;According to the philosophers, the Eternal Father; according 
                to the Jacobins, the Supreme Being.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?&quot; stammered 
                Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is made.</p>
              <p> 　　You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;People do not know each other until they have drunk 
                together. He who empties his glass empties his heart.</p>
              <p> 　　You must come and have a drink with me.</p>
              <p> 　　Such a thing cannot be refused.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Business first.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent thought:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am lost.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small 
                alley leading to the nuns' corner.</p>
              <p> 　　The grave-digger resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed.</p>
              <p> 　　As they must eat, I cannot drink.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is 
                turning a phrase well:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand 
                alley, turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged 
                into a thicket.</p>
              <p> 　　This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the 
                hearse.</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter 
                rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.</p>
              <p> 　　He approached the grave-digger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,&quot; 
                murmured Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Villager,&quot; retorted the man, &quot;I ought not 
                be a grave-digger. My father was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. 
                He destined me for literature.</p>
              <p> 　　But he had reverses.</p>
              <p> 　　He had losses on 'change. I was obliged to renounce the profession 
                of author.</p>
              <p> 　　But I am still a public writer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you are not a grave-digger, then?&quot; returned 
                Fauchelevent, clutching at this branch, feeble as it was.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The one does not hinder the other.</p>
              <p> 　　I cumulate.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent did not understand this last word.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come have a drink,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Here a remark becomes necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish, offered a drink, but he 
                did not explain himself on one point; who was to pay?</p>
              <p> 　　Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. 
                An offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation 
                created by the new grave-digger, and it was necessary to make 
                this offer, but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of 
                an hour named after Rabelais in the dark, and that not unintentionally. 
                As for himself, Fauchelevent did not wish to pay, troubled as 
                he was.</p>
              <p> 　　The grave-digger went on with a superior smile:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One must eat.</p>
              <p> 　　I have accepted Father Mestienne's reversion. One gets to 
                be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes.</p>
              <p> 　　To the labor of the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have 
                my scrivener's stall in the market of the Rue de Sevres. You know? 
                the Umbrella Market.</p>
              <p> 　　All the cooks of the Red Cross apply to me.</p>
              <p> 　　I scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers. 
                In the morning I write love letters; in the evening I dig graves. 
                Such is life, rustic.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hearse was still advancing.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree, was gazing about 
                him on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But,&quot; continued the grave-digger, &quot;a man cannot 
                serve two mistresses. I must choose between the pen and the mattock.</p>
              <p> 　　The mattock is ruining my hand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hearse halted.</p>
              <p> 　　The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little 
                on a pile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a farce this is!&quot; repeated Fauchelevent in 
                consternation.</p>

              <p> 　　SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS</p>
              <p> 　　 The gamin--the street Arab--of Paris is the dwarf of the 
                giant.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes 
                has a shirt, but, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes 
                has shoes, but then they have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, 
                and he loves it, for he finds his mother there; but he prefers 
                the street, because there he finds liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whose foundation 
                consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar metaphors:</p>
              <p> 　　to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; his own occupations, 
                calling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps, establishing 
                means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains, 
                which he calls making the bridge of arts, crying discourses pronounced 
                by the authorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out 
                the cracks in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed 
                of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on 
                the public streets. This curious money, which receives the name 
                of loques--rags--has an invariable and well-regulated currency 
                in this little Bohemia of children.</p>
              <p> 　　Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively 
                in the corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, the 
                daddy-long-legs, &quot;the devil,&quot; a black insect, which 
                menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns.</p>
              <p> 　　He has his fabulous monster, which has scales under its belly, 
                but is not a lizard, which has pustules on its back, but is not 
                a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that 
                have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes 
                slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a look, 
                and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this 
                monster &quot;the deaf thing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The search for these &quot;deaf things&quot; among the stones 
                is a joy of formidable nature.</p>
              <p> 　　Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving-stone, 
                and taking a look at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is celebrated 
                for the interesting treasures which are to be found there.</p>
              <p> 　　There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines, there 
                are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in the ditches 
                of the Champs-de-Mars.</p>
              <p> 　　As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of 
                them as Talleyrand.</p>
              <p> 　　He is no less cynical, but he is more honest. He is endowed 
                with a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets 
                the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges 
                boldly from high comedy to farce.</p>
              <p> 　　A funeral passes by.</p>
              <p> 　　Among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hey there!&quot; shouts some street Arab, &quot;how 
                long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own 
                work?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another is in a crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　A grave man, adorned with spectacles and trinkets, turns round 
                indignantly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You good-for-nothing, you have seized my wife's waist!&quot;--&quot;I, 
                sir?</p>
              <p> 　　Search me!&quot;</p>

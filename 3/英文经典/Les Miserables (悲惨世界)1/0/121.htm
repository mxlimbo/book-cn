              <p> 　　NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage 
                gate than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This 
                entrance, which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, 
                permitted a view of two things, neither of which have anything 
                very funereal about them,--a courtyard surrounded by walls hung 
                with vines, and the face of a lounging porter.</p>
              <p> 　　Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall trees were 
                visible.</p>
              <p> 　　When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when a glass 
                of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number 
                62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression 
                of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a 
                glimpse.</p>
              <p> 　　The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.</p>
              <p> 　　If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,-- 
                which was even nearly impossible for every one, for there was 
                an open sesame! which it was necessary to know,--if, the porter 
                once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, on which 
                opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that 
                only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow 
                one's self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, with a 
                dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one ventured 
                to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, and 
                arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash 
                and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency. 
                Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. 
                The corridor took a turn and became dark.</p>
              <p> 　　If one doubled this cape, one arrived a few paces further 
                on, in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because 
                it was not fastened.</p>
              <p> 　　If one opened it, one found one's self in a little chamber 
                about six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and 
                hung with nankin paper with green flowers, at fifteen sous the 
                roll.</p>
              <p> 　　A white, dull light fell from a large window, with tiny panes, 
                on the left, which usurped the whole width of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard neither 
                a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamber 
                was not furnished; there was not even a chair.</p>
              <p> 　　One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a 
                quadrangular hole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing 
                iron bars, black, knotted, solid, which formed squares-- I had 
                almost said meshes--of less than an inch and a half in diagonal 
                length.</p>
              <p> 　　The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm 
                and orderly manner to those iron bars, without being startled 
                or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact. Supposing 
                that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an 
                entrance or an exit through the square hole, this grating would 
                have prevented it.</p>
              <p> 　　It did not allow the passage of the body, but it did allow 
                the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the mind. This seems 
                to have occurred to them, for it had been re-enforced by a sheet 
                of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and pierced 
                with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer.</p>
              <p> 　　At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced 
                exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box.</p>
              <p> 　　A bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of 
                the grated opening.</p>
              <p> 　　If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice 
                very near at hand, which made one start.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is there?&quot; the voice demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a woman's voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it 
                was mournful.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary 
                to know. If one did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became 
                silent once more, as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre 
                had been on the other side of it.</p>
              <p> 　　If one knew the password, the voice resumed, &quot;Enter on 
                the right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass 
                door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray.</p>
              <p> 　　On raising the latch and crossing the threshold, one experienced 
                precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre 
                into a grated baignoire, before the grating is lowered and the 
                chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in a sort of theatre-box, 
                narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a much-frayed straw 
                matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass 
                door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean upon, 
                bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the 
                grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was 
                a monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted 
                to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.</p>
              <p> 　　The first minutes passed; when one's eyes began to grow used 
                to this cellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, 
                but got no further than six inches beyond it.</p>
              <p> 　　There he encountered a barrier of black shutters, re-enforced 
                and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread 
                yellow.</p>
              <p> 　　These shutters were divided into long, narrow slats, and they 
                masked the entire length of the grating. They were always closed.</p>
              <p> 　　At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding 
                from behind these shutters, and saying:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am here.</p>
              <p> 　　What do you wish with me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice.</p>
              <p> 　　No one was visible. Hardly the sound of a breath was audible.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked, 
                that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb.</p>
              <p> 　　If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare 
                conditions, the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; 
                the evoked spirit became an apparition.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one perceived so far 
                as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only the mouth 
                and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black veil.</p>
              <p> 　　One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was 
                barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with 
                you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.</p>
              <p> 　　The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such 
                a manner that you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the 
                black. This light was symbolical.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening 
                which was made in that place shut off from all glances.</p>
              <p> 　　A profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning.</p>
              <p> 　　Your eyes searched that vagueness, and sought to make out 
                the surroundings of the apparition. At the expiration of a very 
                short time you discovered that you could see nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist 
                mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, 
                a silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, 
                a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.</p>
              <p> 　　What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which 
                was called the Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. 
                The box in which you stood was the parlor.</p>
              <p> 　　The first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress 
                who always sat motionless and silent, on the other side of the 
                wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron grating and 
                the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.</p>
              <p> 　　The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact 
                that the parlor, which had a window on the side of the world, 
                had none on the side of the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there 
                was a light; there was life in the midst of that death.</p>
              <p> 　　Although this was the most strictly walled of all convents, 
                we shall endeavor to make our way into it, and to take the reader 
                in, and to say, without transgressing the proper bounds, things 
                which story-tellers have never seen, and have, therefore, never 
                described.</p>

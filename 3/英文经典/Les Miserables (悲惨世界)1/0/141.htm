              <p> 　　FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions, 
                notably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on 
                critical occasions.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form 
                of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, 
                who was that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother 
                Innocente, who was ordinarily cheerful.</p>
              <p> 　　The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of 
                the cell. The prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her 
                eyes and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent bowed again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here I am, reverend Mother.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have something to say to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so have I,&quot; said Fauchelevent with a boldness 
                which caused him inward terror, &quot;I have something to say 
                to the very reverend Mother.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The prioress stared at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! you have a communication to make to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A request.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, speak.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category 
                of peasants who have assurance.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not 
                distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a 
                success during the something more than two years which he had 
                passed in the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　Always solitary and busied about his gardening, he had nothing 
                else to do than to indulge his curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing 
                to and fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows. By 
                dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all 
                those phantoms with flesh, and those corpses were alive for him. 
                He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener, and like a blind 
                man whose hearing becomes more acute.</p>
              <p> 　　He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of 
                the different peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn 
                and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx 
                babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and 
                concealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought 
                him stupid.</p>
              <p> 　　A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of 
                Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a curious mute. He inspired confidence.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he was regular, and never went out except for well-demonstrated 
                requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden.</p>
              <p> 　　This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. None 
                the less, he had set two men to chattering:</p>
              <p> 　　the porter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities 
                of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he 
                was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture; in this 
                way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns, 
                one as to their life, the other as to their death.</p>
              <p> 　　But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought 
                a great deal of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into 
                the bargain,--what qualities! They would have found it difficult 
                to replace him.</p>
              <p> 　　The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that 
                he is appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep 
                rustic harangue to the reverend prioress.</p>
              <p> 　　He talked a long time about his age, his infirmities, the 
                surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, of the 
                increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden, 
                of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when 
                he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because 
                of the moon, and he wound up as follows: &quot;That he had a brother&quot;--(the 
                prioress made a movement),--&quot;a brother no longer young&quot;--(a 
                second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive 
                of reassurance),--&quot;that, if he might be permitted, this brother 
                would come and live with him and help him, that he was an excellent 
                gardener, that the community would receive from him good service, 
                better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not 
                admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and 
                that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged, greatly 
                to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little daughter 
                whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in the 
                house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping 
                of her rosary between her fingers, and said to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this 
                evening?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For what purpose?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To serve as a lever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, reverend Mother,&quot; replied Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the 
                adjoining room, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the 
                vocal mothers were probably assembled.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent was left alone.</p>

              <p> 　　 As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean 
                awoke.</p>
              <p> 　　What woke him was that his bed was too good.</p>
              <p> 　　It was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed, and, 
                although he had not undressed, the sensation was too novel not 
                to disturb his slumbers.</p>
              <p> 　　He had slept more than four hours.</p>
              <p> 　　His fatigue had passed away. He was accustomed not to devote 
                many hours to repose.</p>
              <p> 　　He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded 
                him; then he closed them again, with the intention of going to 
                sleep once more.</p>
              <p> 　　When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various 
                matters preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second 
                time. Sleep comes more easily than it returns.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what happened to Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one 
                has in one's mind are troubled.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories 
                of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell 
                and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming disproportionately 
                large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and perturbed 
                pool.</p>
              <p> 　　Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which kept 
                constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all 
                others.</p>
              <p> 　　We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the 
                six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame 
                Magloire had placed on the table.</p>
              <p> 　　Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A 
                few paces distant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room 
                to reach the one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had 
                been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the 
                head of the bed.-- He had taken careful note of this cupboard.--On 
                the right, as you entered from the dining-room.--They were solid.--And 
                old silver.-- From the ladle one could get at least two hundred 
                francs.-- Double what he had earned in nineteen years.--It is 
                true that he would have earned more if &quot;the administration 
                had not robbed him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which 
                there was certainly mingled some struggle.</p>
              <p> 　　Three o'clock struck.</p>
              <p> 　　He opened his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a 
                sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack, 
                which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung 
                his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed his feet on the 
                floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing it, seated 
                on his bed.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which 
                would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who 
                had seen him thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house 
                where all were sleeping.</p>
              <p> 　　All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed 
                them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful 
                attitude, and became motionless once more.</p>
              <p> 　　Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we 
                have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, 
                withdrew, re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then 
                he thought, also, without knowing why, and with the mechanical 
                persistence of revery, of a convict named Brevet, whom he had 
                known in the galleys, and whose trousers had been upheld by a 
                single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern of that 
                suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained in this situation, and would have so remained 
                indefinitely, even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the 
                half or quarter hour.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, &quot;Come 
                on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; 
                all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with 
                short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The 
                night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed 
                large clouds driven by the wind.</p>
              <p> 　　This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, 
                eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort 
                of twilight.</p>
              <p> 　　This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, 
                intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid 
                light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which 
                the passersby come and go.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had 
                no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according 
                to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened 
                it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room 
                abruptly, he closed it again immediately.</p>
              <p> 　　He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies 
                rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low 
                white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived 
                tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that 
                the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with 
                trees.</p>
              <p> 　　Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that 
                of a man who has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped 
                his knapsack, opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something 
                which he placed on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, 
                shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, 
                put on his cap, drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for his 
                cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of the window; then returned 
                to the bed, and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited 
                there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at 
                one end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness 
                for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed. 
                Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.</p>
              <p> 　　In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it 
                as nothing more than a miner's candlestick.</p>
              <p> 　　Convicts were, at that period, sometimes employed in quarrying 
                stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not 
                rare for them to have miners' tools at their command.</p>
              <p> 　　These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated 
                at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are 
                stuck into the rock.</p>
              <p> 　　He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath 
                and trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps 
                to the door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as 
                we already know.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at this door, he found it ajar.</p>
              <p> 　　The Bishop had not closed it.</p>

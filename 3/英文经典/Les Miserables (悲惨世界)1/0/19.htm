              <p> 　　 Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, 
                we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one 
                of Mademoiselle Baptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein 
                the conversation between the convict and the Bishop is described 
                with ingenious minuteness.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;. . . This man paid no attention to any one.</p>
              <p> 　　He ate with the voracity of a starving man.</p>
              <p> 　　However, after supper he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`Monsieur le Cure of the good God, all this is far too 
                good for me; but I must say that the carters who would not allow 
                me to eat with them keep a better table than you do.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`They are more fatigued than I.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`No,' returned the man, `they have more money.</p>
              <p> 　　You are poor; I see that plainly.</p>
              <p> 　　You cannot be even a curate.</p>
              <p> 　　Are you really a cure?</p>
              <p> 　　Ah, if the good God were but just, you certainly ought to 
                be a cure!'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`The good God is more than just,' said my brother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A moment later he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you 
                are going?'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`With my road marked out for me.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think that is what the man said.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling 
                is hard. If the nights are cold, the days are hot.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`You are going to a good country,' said my brother.</p>
              <p> 　　`During the Revolution my family was ruined.</p>
              <p> 　　I took refuge in Franche-Comte at first, and there I lived 
                for some time by the toil of my hands. My will was good.</p>
              <p> 　　I found plenty to occupy me.</p>
              <p> 　　One has only to choose. There are paper mills, tanneries, 
                distilleries, oil factories, watch factories on a large scale, 
                steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries at least, four 
                of which, situated at Lods, at Chatillon, at Audincourt, and at 
                Beure, are tolerably large.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the 
                names which my brother mentioned.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear 
                sister?'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I replied,--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who 
                was captain of the gates at Pontarlier under the old regime.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`Yes,' resumed my brother; `but in '93, one had no longer 
                any relatives, one had only one's arms.</p>
              <p> 　　I worked.</p>
              <p> 　　They have, in the country of Pontarlier, whither you are going, 
                Monsieur Valjean, a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry, 
                my sister. It is their cheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained 
                to him, with great minuteness, what these fruitieres of Pontarlier 
                were; that they were divided into two classes:</p>
              <p> 　　the big barns which belong to the rich, and where there are 
                forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand 
                cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres, which belong 
                to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold 
                their cows in common, and share the proceeds. `They engage the 
                services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin 
                receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks 
                the quantity on a double tally.</p>
              <p> 　　It is towards the end of April that the work of the cheese-dairies 
                begins; it is towards the middle of June that the cheese-makers 
                drive their cows to the mountains.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The man recovered his animation as he ate.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother made him drink that good Mauves wine, which he 
                does not drink himself, because he says that wine is expensive.</p>
              <p> 　　My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety 
                of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words 
                with graceful attentions to me.</p>
              <p> 　　He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin, 
                as though he wished the man to understand, without advising him 
                directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge.</p>
              <p> 　　One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, 
                did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few 
                words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man 
                of what he was, nor of what my brother was. To all appearances, 
                it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing 
                the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the passage might 
                remain behind.</p>
              <p> 　　This might have appeared to any one else who had this, unfortunate 
                man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well 
                as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with 
                moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation 
                to conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even 
                ask him from what country he came, nor what was his history.</p>
              <p> 　　For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed 
                to avoid everything which could remind him of it.</p>
              <p> 　　To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my 
                brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise 
                a gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because 
                they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark 
                there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. 
                By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing 
                in my brother's heart.</p>
              <p> 　　He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean 
                Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; 
                that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him 
                believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, 
                by treating him just in his ordinary way.</p>
              <p> 　　Is not this indeed, to understand charity well?</p>
              <p> 　　Is there not, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in 
                this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from 
                allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, 
                not to touch it at all?</p>
              <p> 　　It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother's 
                private thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained 
                all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, 
                even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped 
                with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner 
                in which he would have supped with M. Gedeon le Provost, or with 
                the curate of the parish.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there 
                came a knock at the door.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My 
                brother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous 
                which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud.</p>
              <p> 　　The man was not paying much heed to anything then.</p>
              <p> 　　He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much fatigued.</p>
              <p> 　　After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother 
                said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, `You must 
                be in great need of your bed.'</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly.</p>
              <p> 　　I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this traveller 
                to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, 
                to carry to the man's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, which 
                was in my room.</p>
              <p> 　　The nights are frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity 
                that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. My brother 
                bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the sources 
                of the Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife which 
                I use at table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame Magloire returned immediately.</p>
              <p> 　　We said our prayers in the drawing-room, where we hang up 
                the linen, and then we each retired to our own chambers, without 
                saying a word to each other.&quot;</p>

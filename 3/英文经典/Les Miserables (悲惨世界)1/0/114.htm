              <p> 　　THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT</p>
              <p> 　　 In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form 
                an exact idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the 
                angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue 
                Polonceau into this lane.</p>
              <p> 　　Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, 
                as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the 
                left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous 
                parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached 
                the Rue Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very 
                lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side 
                adjoining the Rue Polonceau.</p>
              <p> 　　There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended 
                to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall.</p>
              <p> 　　This wall did not abut directly on the Street; it formed a 
                deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners <br>
                from two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, 
                the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.</p>
              <p> 　　Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended 
                along the Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 
                49, and along the Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, 
                as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose 
                gable it intersected, thus forming another retreating angle in 
                the street. This gable was sombre of aspect; only one window was 
                visible, or, to speak more correctly, two shutters covered with 
                a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.</p>
              <p> 　　The state of the places of which we are here giving a description 
                is rigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise 
                memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.</p>
              <p> 　　The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a 
                colossal and wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage 
                of perpendicular planks, the upper ones being broader than the 
                lower, bound together by long transverse strips of iron. At one 
                side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions, and 
                which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously.</p>
              <p> 　　A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall 
                was covered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.</p>
              <p> 　　In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, 
                this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look 
                which tempted him.</p>
              <p> 　　He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that 
                if he could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. 
                First he conceived an idea, then a hope.</p>
              <p> 　　In the central portion of the front of this building, on the 
                Rue Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different 
                stories ancient cistern pipes of lead.</p>
              <p> 　　The various branches of the pipes which led from one central 
                pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on 
                the front.</p>
              <p> 　　These ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated 
                those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of 
                old farm-houses.</p>
              <p> 　　This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was 
                the first thing that struck Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He seated Cosette with her back against a stone post, with 
                an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where the conduit 
                touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up 
                by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and 
                past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated 
                with heavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof. And 
                then, the moon fell full upon that facade, and the man who was 
                watching at the corner of the street would have seen Jean Valjean 
                in the act of climbing.</p>
              <p> 　　And finally, what was to be done with Cosette? How was she 
                to be drawn up to the top of a three-story house?</p>
              <p> 　　He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, 
                and crawled along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.</p>
              <p> 　　When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, 
                he noticed that no one could see him there.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have just explained, he was concealed from all eyes, 
                no matter from which direction they were approaching; besides 
                this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps 
                they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the linden-tree 
                and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at least, 
                hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees, 
                and spend the remainder of the night.</p>
              <p> 　　Time was passing; he must act quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized 
                the fact that it was impracticable outside and in.</p>
              <p> 　　He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully 
                decrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks 
                were rotten; the iron bands--there were only three of them--were 
                rusted.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten 
                barrier.</p>
              <p> 　　On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it 
                had neither hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; 
                the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break. 
                Through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn 
                slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together, which passers-by 
                might still have seen there ten years ago.</p>
              <p> 　　He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this 
                apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against 
                which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, 
                one found one's self face to face with a wall.</p>

              <p> 　　ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH</p>
              <p> 　　 Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of 
                Vernon at this epoch, and who had happened to walk across that 
                fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, 
                by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he 
                dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of 
                age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse 
                gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, 
                was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face 
                nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead 
                which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, 
                who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of 
                those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, 
                and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, 
                charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were 
                they much larger:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;these are gardens,&quot; and were they a little smaller: 
                &quot;these are bouquets.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, and on 
                a house at the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have 
                just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the 
                most humble of these houses about 1817.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with 
                a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, 
                neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of 
                earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for 
                the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. These flowers 
                were his occupation.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets 
                of water, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and 
                he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed 
                to have been forgotten by nature.</p>
              <p> 　　He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the 
                formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the cultivation 
                of rare and precious shrubs from America and China.</p>
              <p> 　　He was in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, 
                cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air 
                of kindness, sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless 
                and thoughtful for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the 
                trees, the babble of a child in a house, or with his eyes fixed 
                on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass, of which the 
                sun made a carbuncle.</p>
              <p> 　　His table was very plain, and he drank more milk than wine.</p>
              <p> 　　A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded him.</p>
              <p> 　　He was so timid that be seemed shy, he rarely went out, and 
                he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his 
                cure, the Abbe Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if the inhabitants 
                of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious to see 
                his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with 
                a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the &quot;brigand of the Loire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, 
                biographies, the Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, 
                would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable 
                frequency, the name of Georges Pontmercy.</p>
              <p> 　　When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier 
                in Saintonge's regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　The revolution broke out. Saintonge's regiment formed a part 
                of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments of the monarchy 
                preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the 
                monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, 
                at Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who 
                formed Houchard's rearguard.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of 
                the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and 
                only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon 
                had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of 
                the glacis.</p>
              <p> 　　He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel, 
                where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the 
                thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert.</p>
              <p> 　　Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy 
                sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midst 
                of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to 
                say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier.&quot; 
                He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment 
                when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forward!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of 
                the campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa 
                to some obscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps'-nest 
                of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese commander wanted 
                to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between 
                decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly 
                past under the guns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further 
                on, his audacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace, 
                and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops 
                to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and horses that 
                the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was in 
                that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand.</p>
              <p> 　　At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of 
                bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 
                9th Dragoons.</p>
              <p> 　　He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable march 
                in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the cavalry 
                of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of 
                the line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and 
                overthrew the Guard.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, 
                Melas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.</p>
              <p> 　　He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which 
                Mortier commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred 
                to the 55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders.</p>
              <p> 　　At Eylau he was in the cemetery where, for the space of two 
                hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author 
                of this book, sustained alone with his company of eighty-three 
                men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercy was one of the 
                three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He was at Friedland.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he saw Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Then La Beresina, then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, 
                and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, 
                Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the 
                redoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, 
                he put ten Cossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, 
                but his corporal.</p>
              <p> 　　He was well slashed up on this occasion, and twenty-seven 
                splinters were extracted from his left arm alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged 
                with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was called 
                under the old regime, the double hand, that is to say, an equal 
                aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or 
                a squadron or a battalion as an officer.</p>
              <p> 　　It is from this aptitude, perfected by a military education, 
                which certain special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, 
                for example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and 
                the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba.</p>
              <p> 　　At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in 
                Dubois' brigade.</p>
              <p> 　　It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion.</p>
              <p> 　　He came and cast the flag at the Emperor's feet.</p>
              <p> 　　He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he 
                had received a sword-cut across his face.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer 
                of the Legion of Honor!&quot; Pontmercy replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, I thank you for my widow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An hour later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same &quot;brigand 
                of the Loire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　We have already seen something of his history.</p>
              <p> 　　After Waterloo, Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the 
                hollow road of Ohain, as it will be remembered, had succeeded 
                in joining the army, and had dragged himself from ambulance to 
                ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire.</p>
              <p> 　　The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent 
                him into residence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. 
                King Louis XVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during 
                the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all, did not recognize 
                his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade 
                of colonel, nor his title of baron.</p>
              <p> 　　He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself 
                &quot;Colonel Baron Pontmercy.&quot; He had only an old blue coat, 
                and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an 
                officer of the Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had 
                him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for &quot;illegal&quot; 
                wearing of this decoration. When this notice was conveyed to him 
                through an officious intermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter 
                smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not know whether I no longer understand French, 
                or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is that I do not 
                understand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette.</p>
              <p> 　　They dared not interfere with him. Two or three times the 
                Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote 
                to him with the following address: A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating 
                in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed 
                to General Bonaparte.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by 
                having in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners 
                who refused to salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal's 
                spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the 
                streets of Vernon, stepped up to him, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Crown Attorney, am I permitted to wear my scar?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. 
                He had hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. 
                He lived there alone, we have just seen how.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Empire, between two wars, he had found time to marry 
                Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois, thoroughly indignant 
                at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The greatest families are forced into it.&quot; In 1815, 
                Madame Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, 
                lofty in sentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, 
                leaving a child.</p>
              <p> 　　This child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude; but 
                the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring 
                that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him.</p>
              <p> 　　The father had yielded in the little one's interest, and had 
                transferred his love to flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred 
                up mischief nor conspired.</p>
              <p> 　　He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he 
                was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed 
                his time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. 
                The colonel was &quot;a bandit&quot; to him.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel, except when he 
                occasionally made mocking allusions to &quot;his Baronship.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt 
                to see his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the 
                latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, 
                Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to 
                bring up the child in their own way.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, 
                but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right and 
                sacrificing no one but himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; 
                but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was 
                considerable. This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very 
                rich on the maternal side, and her sister's son was her natural 
                heir.</p>
              <p> 　　The boy, whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, 
                but nothing more. No one opened his mouth to him about it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, in the society into which his grandfather took 
                him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually enlightened 
                the little boy's mind; he had finally understood something of 
                the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which 
                were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration 
                and slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father 
                only with shame and with a pain at his heart.</p>
              <p> 　　While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped 
                away every two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like 
                a criminal breaking his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, 
                at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, 
                trembling lest the aunt should turn round, concealed behind a 
                pillar, motionless, not daring to breathe, he gazed at his child. 
                The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster.</p>
              <p> 　　From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon, 
                M. l'Abbe Mabeuf.</p>
              <p> 　　That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, 
                who had often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar 
                on his cheek, and the large tears in his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　That man, who had so manly an air, yet who was weeping like 
                a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had 
                encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized 
                the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance 
                to the cure, and both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext 
                or other.</p>
              <p> 　　This visit led to others.</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at first, ended 
                by opening his heart, and the cure and the warden finally came 
                to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his 
                happiness to his child's future. This caused the cure to regard 
                him with veneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, 
                became fond of the cure.</p>
              <p> 　　And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate 
                each other, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest 
                and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same.</p>
              <p> 　　The one has devoted his life to his country here below, the 
                other to his country on high; that is the only difference.</p>
              <p> 　　Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George's 
                day, Marius wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated 
                by his aunt, and which one would have pronounced to be copied 
                from some formula; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; 
                and the father answered them with very tender letters which the 
                grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.</p>
            　　ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH
              <p> 　　 Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of 
                Vernon at this epoch, and who had happened to walk across that 
                fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, 
                by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he 
                dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of 
                age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse 
                gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, 
                was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face 
                nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead 
                which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, 
                who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of 
                those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, 
                and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, 
                charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were 
                they much larger:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;these are gardens,&quot; and were they a little smaller: 
                &quot;these are bouquets.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, and on 
                a house at the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have 
                just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the 
                most humble of these houses about 1817.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with 
                a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, 
                neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of 
                earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for 
                the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. These flowers 
                were his occupation.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets 
                of water, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and 
                he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed 
                to have been forgotten by nature.</p>
              <p> 　　He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the 
                formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the cultivation 
                of rare and precious shrubs from America and China.</p>
              <p> 　　He was in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, 
                cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air 
                of kindness, sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless 
                and thoughtful for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the 
                trees, the babble of a child in a house, or with his eyes fixed 
                on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass, of which the 
                sun made a carbuncle.</p>
              <p> 　　His table was very plain, and he drank more milk than wine.</p>
              <p> 　　A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded him.</p>
              <p> 　　He was so timid that be seemed shy, he rarely went out, and 
                he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his 
                cure, the Abbe Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if the inhabitants 
                of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious to see 
                his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with 
                a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the &quot;brigand of the Loire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, 
                biographies, the Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, 
                would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable 
                frequency, the name of Georges Pontmercy.</p>
              <p> 　　When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier 
                in Saintonge's regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　The revolution broke out. Saintonge's regiment formed a part 
                of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments of the monarchy 
                preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the 
                monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, 
                at Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who 
                formed Houchard's rearguard.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of 
                the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and 
                only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon 
                had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of 
                the glacis.</p>
              <p> 　　He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel, 
                where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the 
                thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert.</p>
              <p> 　　Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy 
                sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midst 
                of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to 
                say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier.&quot; 
                He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment 
                when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forward!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of 
                the campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa 
                to some obscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps'-nest 
                of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese commander wanted 
                to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between 
                decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly 
                past under the guns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further 
                on, his audacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace, 
                and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops 
                to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and horses that 
                the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was in 
                that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand.</p>
              <p> 　　At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of 
                bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 
                9th Dragoons.</p>
              <p> 　　He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable march 
                in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the cavalry 
                of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of 
                the line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and 
                overthrew the Guard.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, 
                Melas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.</p>
              <p> 　　He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which 
                Mortier commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred 
                to the 55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders.</p>
              <p> 　　At Eylau he was in the cemetery where, for the space of two 
                hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author 
                of this book, sustained alone with his company of eighty-three 
                men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercy was one of the 
                three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He was at Friedland.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he saw Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Then La Beresina, then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, 
                and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, 
                Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the 
                redoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, 
                he put ten Cossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, 
                but his corporal.</p>
              <p> 　　He was well slashed up on this occasion, and twenty-seven 
                splinters were extracted from his left arm alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged 
                with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was called 
                under the old regime, the double hand, that is to say, an equal 
                aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or 
                a squadron or a battalion as an officer.</p>
              <p> 　　It is from this aptitude, perfected by a military education, 
                which certain special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, 
                for example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and 
                the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba.</p>
              <p> 　　At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in 
                Dubois' brigade.</p>
              <p> 　　It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion.</p>
              <p> 　　He came and cast the flag at the Emperor's feet.</p>
              <p> 　　He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he 
                had received a sword-cut across his face.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer 
                of the Legion of Honor!&quot; Pontmercy replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, I thank you for my widow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An hour later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same &quot;brigand 
                of the Loire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　We have already seen something of his history.</p>
              <p> 　　After Waterloo, Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the 
                hollow road of Ohain, as it will be remembered, had succeeded 
                in joining the army, and had dragged himself from ambulance to 
                ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire.</p>
              <p> 　　The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent 
                him into residence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. 
                King Louis XVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during 
                the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all, did not recognize 
                his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade 
                of colonel, nor his title of baron.</p>
              <p> 　　He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself 
                &quot;Colonel Baron Pontmercy.&quot; He had only an old blue coat, 
                and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an 
                officer of the Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had 
                him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for &quot;illegal&quot; 
                wearing of this decoration. When this notice was conveyed to him 
                through an officious intermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter 
                smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not know whether I no longer understand French, 
                or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is that I do not 
                understand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette.</p>
              <p> 　　They dared not interfere with him. Two or three times the 
                Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote 
                to him with the following address: A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating 
                in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed 
                to General Bonaparte.</p>
              <p> 　　Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by 
                having in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners 
                who refused to salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal's 
                spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the 
                streets of Vernon, stepped up to him, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Crown Attorney, am I permitted to wear my scar?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. 
                He had hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. 
                He lived there alone, we have just seen how.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Empire, between two wars, he had found time to marry 
                Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois, thoroughly indignant 
                at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The greatest families are forced into it.&quot; In 1815, 
                Madame Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, 
                lofty in sentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, 
                leaving a child.</p>
              <p> 　　This child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude; but 
                the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring 
                that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him.</p>
              <p> 　　The father had yielded in the little one's interest, and had 
                transferred his love to flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred 
                up mischief nor conspired.</p>
              <p> 　　He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he 
                was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed 
                his time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. 
                The colonel was &quot;a bandit&quot; to him.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel, except when he 
                occasionally made mocking allusions to &quot;his Baronship.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt 
                to see his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the 
                latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, 
                Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to 
                bring up the child in their own way.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, 
                but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right and 
                sacrificing no one but himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; 
                but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was 
                considerable. This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very 
                rich on the maternal side, and her sister's son was her natural 
                heir.</p>
              <p> 　　The boy, whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, 
                but nothing more. No one opened his mouth to him about it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, in the society into which his grandfather took 
                him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually enlightened 
                the little boy's mind; he had finally understood something of 
                the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which 
                were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration 
                and slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father 
                only with shame and with a pain at his heart.</p>
              <p> 　　While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped 
                away every two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like 
                a criminal breaking his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, 
                at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, 
                trembling lest the aunt should turn round, concealed behind a 
                pillar, motionless, not daring to breathe, he gazed at his child. 
                The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster.</p>
              <p> 　　From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon, 
                M. l'Abbe Mabeuf.</p>
              <p> 　　That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, 
                who had often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar 
                on his cheek, and the large tears in his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　That man, who had so manly an air, yet who was weeping like 
                a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had 
                encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized 
                the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance 
                to the cure, and both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext 
                or other.</p>
              <p> 　　This visit led to others.</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at first, ended 
                by opening his heart, and the cure and the warden finally came 
                to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his 
                happiness to his child's future. This caused the cure to regard 
                him with veneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, 
                became fond of the cure.</p>
              <p> 　　And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate 
                each other, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest 
                and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same.</p>
              <p> 　　The one has devoted his life to his country here below, the 
                other to his country on high; that is the only difference.</p>
              <p> 　　Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George's 
                day, Marius wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated 
                by his aunt, and which one would have pronounced to be copied 
                from some formula; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; 
                and the father answered them with very tender letters which the 
                grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.</p>

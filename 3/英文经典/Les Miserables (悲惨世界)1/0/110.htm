              <p> 　　A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT</p>
              <p> 　　Near Saint-Medard's church there was a poor man who was in 
                the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had 
                been condemned, and on whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing 
                charity.</p>
              <p> 　　He never passed this man without giving him a few sous.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who envied this mendicant 
                said that he belonged to the police. He was an ex-beadle of seventy-five, 
                who was constantly mumbling his prayers.</p>
              <p> 　　One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not 
                Cosette with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath 
                the lantern which had just been lighted.</p>
              <p> 　　The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to his custom, 
                and was much bent over.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms 
                in his hand. The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently 
                at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　This movement was like a flash of lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder. It seemed to him that 
                he had just caught sight, by the light of the street lantern, 
                not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle, but of 
                a well-known and startling face. He experienced the same impression 
                that one would have on finding one's self, all of a sudden, face 
                to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified, petrified, 
                daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring 
                at the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in 
                a rag, and no longer appeared to know that he was there.</p>
              <p> 　　At this strange moment, an instinct-- possibly the mysterious 
                instinct of self-preservation,--restrained Jean Valjean from uttering 
                a word.</p>
              <p> 　　The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance 
                as he had every day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;I am mad!</p>
              <p> 　　I am dreaming!</p>
              <p> 　　Impossible!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he returned profoundly troubled.</p>
              <p> 　　He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face 
                which he thought he had seen was the face of Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not 
                having questioned the man, in order to force him to raise his 
                head a second time.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day, at nightfall, he went back.</p>
              <p> 　　The beggar was at his post.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good day, my good man,&quot; said Jean Valjean, resolutely, 
                handing him a sou.</p>
              <p> 　　The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice, 
                &quot;Thanks, my good sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean felt completely reassured.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to laugh. &quot;How the deuce could I have thought 
                that I saw Javert there?&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Am I going to lose my eyesight now?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he thought no more about it.</p>
              <p> 　　A few days afterwards,--it might have been at eight o'clock 
                in the evening,--he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette 
                spell aloud, when he heard the house door open and then shut again. 
                This struck him as singular.</p>
              <p> 　　The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house except 
                himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not 
                burn out her candles.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.</p>
              <p> 　　He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly 
                be the old woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out 
                to the apothecary's. Jean Valjean listened.</p>
              <p> 　　The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the 
                old woman wore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly 
                resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.</p>
              <p> 　　He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, 
                &quot;Get into bed very softly&quot;; and as he kissed her brow, 
                the steps paused.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards 
                the door, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and 
                holding his breath in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned 
                round, as he heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards 
                the door of his chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole.</p>
              <p> 　　This light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness 
                of the door and the wall. There was evidently some one there, 
                who was holding a candle in his hand and listening.</p>
              <p> 　　Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated.</p>
              <p> 　　But he heard no sound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate 
                that the person who had been listening at the door had removed 
                his shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his 
                bed, and could not close his eyes all night.</p>
              <p> 　　At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, 
                he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some 
                attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine 
                footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. 
                The step was approaching.</p>
              <p> 　　He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, 
                which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made 
                his way by night into the house and had listened at his door, 
                as he passed.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, 
                in front of Jean Valjean's chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　The corridor was too dark to allow of the person's face being 
                distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a ray of 
                light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and Jean 
                Valjean had a complete view of his back.</p>
              <p> 　　The man was of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with 
                a cudgel under his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse 
                of him through his window opening on the boulevard, but he would 
                have been obliged to open the window:</p>
              <p> 　　he dared not.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like 
                himself. Who had given him that key?</p>
              <p> 　　What was the meaning of this?</p>
              <p> 　　When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o'clock in 
                the morning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but 
                he did not question her.</p>
              <p> 　　The good woman appeared as usual.</p>
              <p> 　　As she swept up she remarked to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last 
                night?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o'clock in the evening 
                was the dead of the night.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is true, by the way,&quot; he replied, in the most 
                natural tone possible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who was it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was a new lodger who has come into the house,&quot; 
                said the old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what is his name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name 
                of that sort.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And who is this Monsieur Dumont?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and 
                answered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A gentleman of property, like yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean thought he perceived one.</p>
              <p> 　　When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred 
                francs which he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in 
                his pocket. In spite of all the precautions which he took in this 
                operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou 
                piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized 
                both sides of the boulevard.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw no one.</p>
              <p> 　　The boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　It is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees.</p>
              <p> 　　He went up stairs again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　he said to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He took her by the hand, and they both went out.</p>

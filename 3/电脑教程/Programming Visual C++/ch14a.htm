<P>All the Microsoft Visual C++ examples up to this point have included toolbars and status bars. AppWizard generated the code that initialized these application framework elements as long as you accepted the AppWizard default options Docking Toolbar and Initial Status Bar. The default toolbar provides graphics equivalents for many of the standard application framework menu selections, and the default status bar displays menu prompts together with the keyboard state indicators CAP, NUM, and SCRL.
<P>This chapter shows you how to customize the toolbar and the status bar for your application. You'll be able to add your own toolbar graphical buttons and control their appearance. You'll also learn how to disable the status bar's normal display of menu prompts and keyboard indicators. This allows your application to take over the status bar for its own use.

<A NAME="944"><H1>ISAPI Database Access</H1></A><P>Your ISAPI server extension could use ODBC to access an SQL database. 
Before you write pages of ODBC code, however, check out the Internet 
Database Connector described in the IIS documentation. The Internet Database 
Connector is a ready-to-run DLL, Httpodbc.dll, that collects SQL query 
parameters and formats the output. You control the process by writing an IDC file 
that describes the data source and an HTX file that is a template for the 
resulting HTML file. No C++ programming is necessary.
<P>The Internet Database Connector is for queries only. If you want to 
update a database, you must write your own ISAPI server extension with 
ODBC calls. Make sure your ODBC driver is multithreaded, as is the latest SQL 
server driver.

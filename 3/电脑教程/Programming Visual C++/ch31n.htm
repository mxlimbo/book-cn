<A NAME="786"><H1>ODBC Multithreading</H1></A>
<P>ODBC itself supports multithreaded programming, but not all ODBC 
drivers do. In particular, the Access driver you've used for the preceding examples 
does not support multithreading, but the Microsoft SQL Server driver does. 
Even if your ODBC driver does not support multithreading, you can put all 
your database access code in a worker thread if you want to. (Multithreaded 
programming and worker threads are described in <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>.)

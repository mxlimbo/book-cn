<P>A <U>dynamic</U> <U>splitter</U> <U>window</U> allows the user to split the window at any time by choosing a menu item or by dragging a splitter box located on the scroll bar. The panes in a dynamic splitter window generally use the same view class. The top left pane is initialized to a particular view when the splitter window is created. In a dynamic splitter window, scroll bars are shared among the views. In a window with a single horizontal split, for example, the bottom scroll bar controls both views. A dynamic splitter application starts with a single view object. When the user splits the frame, other view objects are constructed. When the user unsplits the frame, view objects are destroyed.
<P>The panes of a <U>static</U> <U>splitter</U> <U>window</U> are defined when the window is first created and they cannot be changed. The user can move the bars but cannot unsplit or resplit the window. Static splitter windows can accommodate multiple view classes, with the configuration set at creation time. In a static splitter window, each pane has separate scroll bars. In a static splitter window application, all view objects are constructed when the frame is constructed and they are all destroyed when the frame is destroyed.

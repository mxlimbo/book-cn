<P>The MFC library Print Preview feature shows you on screen the <U>exact</U> page and line breaks you'll get when you print your document on a selected printer. The fonts might look a little funny, especially in the smaller sizes, but that's not a problem. Look now at the print preview window that appears in &quot;<A HREF="ch19e.htm">The EX19A Example&#151;A Wysiwyg Print Program</A>&quot;.
<P>Print Preview is an MFC library feature, not a Windows feature. Don't underestimate how much effort went into programming Print Preview. The Print Preview program examines each character individually, determining its position based on the printer's device context. After selecting an approximating font, the program displays the character in the print preview window at the proper location.

<A NAME="1027"><H1>C++ vs. Java</H1></A>
<P>In the last couple of years, there has been a great deal of interest in the Java programming language. Why should you choose C++ over Java? In the first place, a compiled program will always be faster than an interpreted program. Think about a high-performance spreadsheet program with cell formulas and macros. Now imagine the Java virtual machine interpreting the code that, in turn, interprets the formulas and macros. Not pretty, is it? With just-in-time compilation, it's necessary to compile the program every time you load it. Will that code be as good as the optimized output from a C++ compiler?
<P>Execution speed is one factor; access to the operating system is another. For security reasons, Java applets can't perform such tasks as writing to disk and accessing serial ports. In order to be platform-independent, Java application programs are limited to the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; of operating system features. A C++ program for Microsoft Windows is more 
flexible because it can call any Win32 function at any time.
<P>Java will be an important language, but we believe it's just another language, not a revolution. If you need an Internet applet or a truly platform-independent application, choose Java. If you need efficiency and flexibility, choose C++.

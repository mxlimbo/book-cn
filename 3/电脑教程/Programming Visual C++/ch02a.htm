<A NAME="27"><H1>The Microsoft Foundation Class Library Application Framework</H1></A><P>This chapter introduces the Microsoft Foundation Class Library version 
6.0 (the MFC library) application framework by explaining its benefits. You'll see a stripped-down but fully operational MFC library 
program for Microsoft Windows that should help you understand what application 
framework programming is all about. Theory is kept to a minimum here, but 
the sections on message mapping and on documents and views contain 
important information that will help you with the examples in later chapters.

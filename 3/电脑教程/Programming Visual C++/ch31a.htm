<A NAME="764"><H1>Database Management with Microsoft ODBC</H1></A><P>Microcomputers became popular, in part, because businesspeople saw 
them as a low-cost means of tracking inventory, processing orders, printing 
payroll checks, and so forth. Business applications required fast access to 
individual records in a large database. One of the first microcomputer database tools 
was dBASE II, a single-user product with its own programming language and 
file format. Today Windows programmers have a wide choice of 
programmable database management systems (DBMS's), including Inprise Paradox, 
Microsoft Access, Microsoft FoxPro, and Powersoft PowerBuilder. Most of these 
products can access both local data and remote data on a central computer. The latter 
case requires the addition of <U>database</U> 
<U>server</U> software such as ORACLE or Microsoft SQL Server.

Microsoft SQL Server is included with the Enterprise Edition of Visual C++.

<P>How do you, as an MFC programmer, fit into the picture? Visual 
C++ contains all the components you'll need to write 
C++ database applications for Microsoft Windows. Indeed, the product contains two separate 
client-side database access systems: Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and Data 
Access Objects (DAO). In addition, Visual C++ now contains wrapper templates 
for interacting with data directly through OLE DB. This chapter covers the 
ODBC standard, which consists of an extensible set of dynamic link libraries 
(DLLs) that provide a standard database application programming interface. ODBC 
is based on a standardized version of Structured Query Language (SQL). 
With ODBC and SQL, you can write database access code that is independent of 
any database product.
<P>Visual C++ includes tools and MFC classes for ODBC, and that's 
the subject of this chapter. You'll learn the basics of ODBC, and you'll see 
four sample programs: one that uses the ODBC rowset with support from the 
MFC <I>CRecordset</I> class (EX31A), one that uses the MFC 
<I>CRecordView</I> class (EX31B), one that uses multiple recordsets (EX31C), and one that uses the 
<I>CRecordset</I> class without binding (EX31D).

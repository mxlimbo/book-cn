<A NAME="984"><H1>Introducing Dynamic HTML</H1></A><P>Dynamic HyperText Markup Language (DHTML) is a new and 
exciting technology&#151;introduced as part of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 
(IE4)&#151;that provides serious benefits to Webmasters and developers. DHTML could 
ultimately change the way we think about developing Windows applications. 
Why the buzz about DHTML?
<P>It began with the IE4 &quot;HTML display 
engine&quot;&#151;sometimes called Trident in Microsoft literature. As part of the design of Internet Explorer 4, 
Microsoft made Trident a COM component that exposes many of its internal objects 
that are used for displaying HTML pages in Internet Explorer 4. This feature 
allows you to traverse the portions of an HTML page in script or code, as if the 
HTML page were a data structure. Gone are the days of having to parse HTML or 
write grotesque Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts to get to data in a 
form. The real power of DHTML, however, is not this ability to access the 
HTML objects but the ability to actually change and manipulate the HTML page 
on the fly&#151;thus the name Dynamic HTML.
<P>Once you grasp the concept of DHTML, a million possible 
applications come to mind. For Webmasters, DHTML means that much of the logic 
that manipulates a Web page can live in scripts that are downloaded to the 
client. C++ developers can embed DHTML in their applications and use it as an 
embedded Web client or as a super-flexible, dynamic &quot;form&quot; that their 
application changes on the fly. Microsoft Visual 
J++ developers (who use Windows Foundation Classes [WFC]) can actually program DHTML on the server while 
an Internet Explorer client responds to the 
commands&#151;an excellent alternative to CGI and potentially more powerful than Active Server Pages (ASP) 
server-side scripting.
<P>Unfortunately, DHTML is so powerful and extensive that it requires 
a separate book to fill you in on all of the copious details. For example, to 
really leverage DHTML you need to understand all of the possible elements of 
an HTML page: forms, lists, style sheets, and so 
on.<I> Inside Dynamic HTML</I> by Scott Isaacs (Microsoft Press, 1997) is a great resource for learning the details 
of DHTML.
<P>Instead of covering all aspects of DHTML, we will briefly introduce 
you to the DHTML object model, show you how to work with the model from 
the scripting angle (as a reference), and then show you how to work with the 
model from both the Microsoft Foundation Class Library version 4.21 (MFC) and 
the Active Template Library (ATL). These features are all made possible by 
the excellent DHTML support introduced in Visual 
C++ 6.0.

<P>Help technology is in a transition phase at the moment. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format seems to be replacing rich text format (RTF). You can see this in the new Visual C++ online documentation via the MSDN viewer, which uses a new HTML-based help system called HTML Help. Microsoft is developing tools for compiling and indexing HTML files that are not shipped with Visual C++ 6.0. In the meantime, Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library version 6.0 application framework programs are set up to use the WinHelp help engine included with Microsoft Windows. That means you'll be writing RTF files and your programs will be using compiled HLP files.

<P>This chapter first shows you how to construct and process a simple 
stand-alone help file that has a table of contents and lets the user jump between topics. Next you'll see how your MFC library program activates WinHelp with help context IDs derived from window and command IDs keyed to an AppWizard-generated help file. Finally you'll learn how to use the MFC library help message routing system to customize the help capability.

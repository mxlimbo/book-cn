<A NAME="115"><H1>Planning for and Installing SQL Server</H1></A>

<P>If you have appropriate hardware that is running Microsoft Windows, installing Microsoft SQL Server is a snap. It requires little more than inserting the  
CD into the drive and answering a few questions. Even a novice can 
comfortably install SQL Server in less than 15 minutes. The installation program 
does not ask a lot of questions about how to configure your system because SQL  
Server 7 is primarily self-configuring. (We won't spend much time 
discussing the mechanics of the installation program. You can consult the online Help 
and the documentation's step-by-step guide if you need to.)</p>

<P>Installing SQL Server is so easy that you might be tempted to dive in a 
bit too soon. That's OK if you're in &quot;learning mode,&quot; but an installation that 
will be part of a production system deserves some thoughtful planning.</p>

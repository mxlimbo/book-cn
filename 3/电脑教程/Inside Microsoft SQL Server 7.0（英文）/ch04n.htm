<P>SQL Server offers unprecedented ease of installation for a database server of 
its caliber. But you should understand your choices in terms of hardware, 
licensing, and sort orders before you proceed too far down the path of a major 
application rollout. Installing SQL Server is also fast and reliable. You need to 
do very little custom configuration because SQL Server 7 automatically 
configures itself as needed.</P>

<P>The SQL Server installation offers options for unattended and 
remote installation, for installing a Desktop version, and for client-tools&#8212;only 
installation. Utilities are provided for changing many of the options chosen during 
the initial installation, but to add new components you must keep your original 
CD handy. (That is, if you haven't copied its contents to a network share.)</P>

<P>The SQL Server engine runs best on Windows NT Server, and your 
production applications are meant to run on SQL Server on Windows NT Server 
or Windows NT Enterprise. Although you can install the desktop version of 
SQL Server on Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95, or Windows 98, many  
SQL Server capabilities are not supported on the desktop version. (We 
discussed these limitations earlier in the chapter.) Memory management and the 
process scheduling behavior on Windows NT Server are better tailored to services 
such as SQL Server than is Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95, or Windows 
98, which focus on desktop applications. The simple fact is that SQL Server 
runs better with medium to large workloads on Windows NT Server than on 
any other platform.</P>

<P>Support for SQL Server on a particular platform or version of 
Windows NT does not necessarily mean that it won't work with other configurations. 
But you should stick with the supported platforms for the following reasons:</P>

<UL>
<P><LI>
Only supported platforms get significant test coverage. An 
unsupported platform might seem to work, but a subtle problem 
might occur later.
</LI></P>

<P><LI>
Authorized SQL Server support providers and Microsoft SQL 
Server Enterprise Technical Support (ETS) focus on the supported 
platforms; if your problem is specific to the unsupported platform, you 
might not be able to get enough help.
</LI></P>

<P><LI>
Typically, a new release of SQL Server is targeted at the most 
recent (or sometimes an impending) release of Windows NT Server 
and also supports the prior major release. As of this writing, 
Windows 2000 is already in Beta 2 release, so SQL Server 7 runs on 
Windows NT 4 (with Service Pack 4) and Windows 2000 (formerly 
called Windows NT 5). It is not supported on Windows NT Server 3.51  
or earlier. If you try to run Setup on a Windows NT version 
earlier than version 4 with Service Pack 4, you will get an error and be 
prevented from continuing.
</LI></P>

<P>You can install SQL Server on any Windows NT Server in your 
domain, but for the best performance do not install it on your primary or backup 
domain controllers (PDCs or BDCs). Although SQL Server will run fine on a 
PDC or BDC, the controller's tasks of maintaining and replicating the Windows 
NT user database take up processing cycles and memory. In less 
resource-intensive environments, this usually doesn't make much of a difference, but if your 
system is part of a large domain, it is better to separate SQL Server processing 
from those activities.</P>

<P>If you want to end up with a poorly performing application or a 
complete project failure, you should wait until the end of the project to deal with 
performance concerns. If, however, you want your application to be the best it 
can be, you must consider performance throughout the development cycle. In 
fact, you must consider performance before you even write your first line of code.
</P>

<P>Every chapter of this book has included some information on 
performance. If you've turned directly to this chapter in hopes of finding the secret to 
improving your lackluster application, you'll be disappointed. We can offer only 
guidelines for you to keep in mind, along with some pointers that refer back to 
earlier information or to other helpful materials.
</P>

<P>Microsoft SQL Server systems can be brilliantly fast with 
well-designed, well-implemented applications. It can support workloads of the type and 
size that no one dreamed possible back in 1988 when SQL Server first 
became available. But with a poorly planned or poorly implemented system, SQL 
Server can perform horribly. Statements like &quot;SQL Server is slow&quot; are not 
uncommon. (Nor are such statements about other database products.) Anytime you hear 
this from someone who has deployed a production application, your first 
thought should be that the person has dropped the ball somewhere along the 
line&#8212;or that SQL Server is unsuitable for the task at hand. (SQL Server can handle 
most systems, but some are still beyond its reach.)
</P>

<P>If this is the first chapter you've turned to, please stop and go back at 
least to <a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a>. All of the chapters from Chapter 3 to this one are relevant 
to performance issues. You might also revisit <a href="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</a>, which is about 
cursors, and <a href="ch13a.htm">Chapter 13</a>, on locking. A thorough understanding of cursors and 
locking is a prerequisite for understanding the material in this chapter.

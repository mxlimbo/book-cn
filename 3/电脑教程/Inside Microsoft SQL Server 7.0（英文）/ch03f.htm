<P>In this chapter, we've looked at the general workings of the SQL Server engine, including the key modules and functional areas that make up the engine. We've also covered issues dealing with integration with Windows NT. By necessity, we've made some simplifications throughout the chapter, but the information should provide some insight into the roles and responsibilities of the major subsystems in SQL Server, the general flow of the system, and the interrelationships among subsystems.

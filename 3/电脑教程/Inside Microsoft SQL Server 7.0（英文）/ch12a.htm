<P>In this chapter, we'll look at some relatively common programming tasks 
that aren't as simple as you might think. If you find a solution here for 
something you need to do, that's great. But the real goal is to give you some insight 
into the power and flexibility of Transact-SQL. For some examples, we'll offer 
multiple solutions, often with different performance characteristics. Keep in 
mind that there are often many ways to solve a problem.</P>

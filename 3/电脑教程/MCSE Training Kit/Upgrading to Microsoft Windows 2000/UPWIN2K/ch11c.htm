partitions and volumes. Common disk management tasks include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Converting storage types</li></p>

<p><li>Creating and extending simple volumes</li></p>

<p><li>Creating and extending spanned volumes</li></p>

<p><li>Creating striped volumes</li></p>

<p><li>Adding disks</li></p>

<p><li>Changing storage type</li></p>

<p><li>Viewing and updating information</li></p>

<p><li>Managing disks on a remote computer</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Identify common disk management tasks.</li></p>
<p><li>Upgrade a basic disk to a dynamic disk.</li></p>
<p><li>Create a new volume.</li></p>

</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="530"><H2>Upgrading Basic Disks to Dynamic Disks</H2></A>

<p>You can convert a disk from basic storage to dynamic storage at any
time with no loss of data. To upgrade (convert) a basic disk to a
dynamic disk, open the Disk Management tool, right-click the basic disk
that you want to upgrade, and then click Upgrade To Dynamic Disk. A
wizard provides on-screen instructions. If the disk you are upgrading
contains either the boot or system partition, or both, you need to
restart the computer to complete the upgrade process.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
As a precaution, you should always have the
data on a disk backed up before you convert the storage type from basic
to dynamic.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>When you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, any existing
partitions on the basic disk become volumes. Table 11.3 describes the
results of converting a disk from basic storage to dynamic storage.</p>

<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Any disks that you upgrade must contain at least 1 MB of unallocated space for the upgrade to succeed.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="531"><H2>Reverting to a Basic Disk from a Dynamic Disk</H2></A>

<p>You must delete all volumes from the dynamic disk before you can
revert the storage type of the disk to basic. After deleting all
volumes on the disk, to revert a dynamic disk to a basic disk, open
Disk Management, right-click the dynamic disk that you want to change
back to a basic disk, and then click Revert To Basic Disk. If you want to revert the dynamic disk on which Windows 2000 is installed, you will have to reinstall Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="532"><H2>Creating and Extending Simple Volumes</H2></A>

<p>A simple volume contains disk space on a single dynamic disk. A
partition and a simple volume may seem like similar uses of disk space;
however, a simple volume does not have the size limits that a partition
has, nor is there a restriction on the number of volumes you can create
on a single disk. You can create a simple volume and format it with
NTFS, FAT, or FAT32.</p>

<p>To create a simple volume, open the Disk Management tool,
right-click unallocated space on the dynamic disk where you want to
create the simple volume, and then click Create Volume. A wizard provides on-screen
instructions.</p>

<p>In addition, you can extend a simple volume to include unallocated
space on the same disk; however, you can extend a simple volume only if
it is formatted with NTFS. You can extend a simple volume to include
either contiguous or noncontiguous unallocated space on the same disk.
However, you cannot extend a system or boot volume. (A system or boot
volume is created when you convert a system or boot partition to
dynamic storage.) To extend an NTFS simple volume, right-click the
simple volume that you want to extend, click Extend Volume, and then
follow the instructions on your screen. When you extend a simple volume
to another disk, it becomes a spanned volume.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
A simple volume is not fault tolerant, but you can mirror a simple volume.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="533"><H2>Creating and Extending Spanned Volumes</H2></A>

<p>A spanned volume consists of disk space from multiple disks (from 2
to 32) combined into one large volume, as shown in Figure 11.3. Spanned
volumes enable you to use the total available free space on multiple disks more
effectively. You can create spanned volumes only on dynamic disks, but
the areas of free space that you combine to create a spanned volume can
be different sizes. Spanned volumes cannot be part of a mirror volume
or striped volume and are not fault tolerant.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 11.3</b> <i>Creating and extending spanned volumes</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Windows 2000 writes data to the first disk in a spanned volume,
completely filling the space, and continues in this manner through each
disk that you include in the spanned volume. When any disk in a spanned volume fails, all
data in the entire volume is lost. You can create spanned volumes on
disks formatted with FAT, FAT32, or NTFS.</p>

<p>By deleting smaller volumes and combining them into one spanned
volume, you can free drive letters for other uses and create a large
volume for file system use. Another benefit of spanned volumes is the
ability to add space to an existing volume when it is full. For
example, when a database on a volume is about to grow beyond the size
of the volume, you could add another disk to the system and then add
that space to the existing volume.</p>

<A NAME="534"><H3>Creating a Spanned Volume</H3></A>

<p>To create a spanned volume, open the Disk Management tool,
right-click unallocated space on one of the dynamic disks where you
want to create the spanned volume, and then click Create Volume. In the
Create Volume wizard, click Next, click Spanned Volume, and then follow
the instructions on your screen.</p>

<A NAME="535"><H3>Extending a Spanned Volume</H3></A>

<p>You can extend an existing spanned volume that is formatted with
NTFS by adding free space. The Disk Management tool formats the new
area without affecting any existing files on the original volume. You
cannot extend volumes formatted with FAT or FAT32. You can extend
spanned volumes on dynamic disks onto a maximum of 32 dynamic
disks.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
After a spanned volume is extended, no
portion of it can be deleted without deleting the entire spanned
volume.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="536"><H2>Creating Striped Volumes</H2></A>

<p>You create striped volumes, similar to spanned volumes, by combining
areas of free space from 2 to 32 disks into one volume. Among the
Windows 2000 Server disk management strategies, striped volumes provide
the best performance. In a striped volume, data is written evenly
across all physical disks in 64-kilobyte (KB) units (see Figure 11.4).
Because the striped volume performs as a single hard disk, Windows 2000
can issue and process concurrent input/output (I/O) commands on all
hard disks that are in the striped volume simultaneously. In this way,
striped volumes can increase the speed of system I/O.</p>

<p>With a striped volume, Windows 2000 writes data to multiple disks,
similar to spanned volumes, except that on a striped volume Windows
2000 writes files across all disks so that data is added to all disks
at the same rate. Like spanned volumes, striped volumes do not provide
fault tolerance. If a disk in a striped volume fails, the data in the entire volume is lost. You cannot extend or mirror striped volumes.</p>

<p>To create a striped volume, open the Disk Management tool,
right-click unallocated space on one of the dynamic disks where you
want to create the striped volume, and then click Create Volume. In the
Create Volume wizard, click Next, click Striped Volume, and then follow the instructions on your screen.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 11.4</b> <i>Benefits of working with striped volumes</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="537"><H2>Adding New Hard Disks</H2></A>

<p>To increase your disk storage, you can add new disks to a computer
or move a disk or group of disks from one computer to another. If the
computer to which you are adding disks does not support <i>hot
swapping</i> (the ability to add or remove disks without shutting down
the computer), shut down the computer, add the disks, and then restart
the computer. The new disks will now appear in the Disk Management
console.</p>

<p>To add a new disk to a computer that supports hot swapping, install
or attach the new hard disk (or disks), and then in the Disk Management
tool, click Rescan Disks on the Action menu. You must use the Rescan
Disks command every time that you remove or add disks to a computer
that supports hot swapping. It should not be necessary to restart the
computer when you add a new disk to your computer. However, you might
need to restart the computer if Disk Management does not detect the new
disk after you run Rescan Disks.</p>

<A NAME="538"><H2>Adding Hard Disks Removed from Another Computer</H2></A>

<p>There may be times you want to uninstall or remove a disk from one
computer and then install the hard disk in a different computer. In
most cases, disks from another computer are imported automatically.
However, if the status of the disk appears as Foreign, you must
right-click the new disk, and then click Import Foreign Disk. A wizard provides on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>The disks are grouped according to the computer name they were moved
from. To specify the disks from the group that you want to add, click
Select Disk. However, if you do not have any dynamic disks installed,
all of the disks are added regardless of the disks that you select.</p>

<p>When you move a dynamic disk to your computer from another computer
running Windows 2000, you can see and use any existing volumes on that
disk.</p>

<A NAME="539"><H3>Failed: Incomplete Volume</H3></A>

<p>If an imported volume's status appears as Failed: Incomplete
Volume, you have imported a disk that contains a spanned or a striped
volume but have failed to import one or more disks that contain the remaining portions of the spanned or striped volume. This also applies to RAID-5 volumes if two
or more disks were not imported. You must import the remaining disks to
complete the volume.</p>

<A NAME="540"><H3>Failed Redundancy</H3></A>

<p>If the imported volume's status appears as Failed Redundancy,
you have imported a mirror volume or a RAID-5 volume but have failed to import
one or more volumes that contain the remaining portions of the mirror or
RAID-5 volume. You will still be able to access data on the volume, but
redundancy is lost. You must import the remaining disks to complete the
volume.</p>

<A NAME="541"><H2>Managing Drive Letters and Paths</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 allows the static assignment of drive letters to
partitions, volumes, and CD-ROM drives. This means that you permanently
assign a drive letter to a specific partition, volume, or CD-ROM drive. It is often
convenient to assign drive letters to removable devices that cause the
devices to appear after the permanent partitions and volumes on the
computer.</p>

<p>You can use the Disk Management tool to mount a local drive to any
empty folder on a local NTFS partition or volume. Mounting a drive at
an empty folder assigns a drive path rather than a drive letter to the
drive. This allows you to use mounted drives to access more than 26
drives on your computer because mounted drives are not subject to the
26-drive limit imposed by drive letters. Mounting at a folder allows
you to use an intuitive name for the folder, such as Project Data.
Users would then save their documents to the Project Data folder rather
than to a drive letter. In Windows 2000, you can add or rearrange
storage devices without the drive path failing because drive paths
retain their association to the drive.</p>

<A NAME="542"><H3>Assigning, Changing, or Removing Drive Letters</H3></A>

<p>You can use up to 24 drive letters, from C through Z. Drive letters
A and B are reserved for floppy disk drives. However, if you only have
one floppy disk drive, you can use the letter B for a network drive.
When you add a new hard disk to an existing computer system, it will
not affect previously assigned drive letters.</p>

<p>To assign, change, or remove a drive letter, open the Disk
Management tool, right-click a partition, logical drive, or volume, and
then click Change Drive Letter And Path. In the Drive Letter And Paths dialog box, you can do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>To assign a drive letter, click Add, click a drive letter,
and then click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>To remove a drive letter, click the drive letter and then
click Remove.</li></p>

<p><li>To modify a drive letter, click the drive letter that you
want to modify and then click Modify. Click the drive letter that you
want to use, and then click OK.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="543"><H3>Assigning or Removing Drive Paths</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 assigns a drive path and not a drive letter to a drive
when you mount a local drive at an empty folder on a local partition or
volume formatted with NTFS. You can create drive paths for partitions
and volumes, and you can format a mounted drive with any Windows
2000-supported file system.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can view all drive paths in Disk Management
by clicking View and then clicking All Drive Paths.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>To assign or remove a drive path, open Disk Management, right-click
the partition or volume, and then click Change Drive Letter And Path.
In the Drive Letter And Paths dialog box, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>To create a new drive path, click Add and then type the path
to the empty folder or click Browse to locate it. When the correct path
is entered, click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>If you are administering a local computer, you can browse
folders on that computer to locate the folder to which you want to
mount the drive. If you are administering a remote computer, browsing
is disabled and you must type the path to an existing folder.</li></p>

<p><li>To remove a drive path, click the drive path and then click
Remove.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You cannot modify a drive path. If you need to
change a drive path, you must remove it and then create a new drive
path with the changed information.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="544"><H3>Managing Mirror Sets on Basic Disks</H3></A>

<p>Mirror sets that you created with Windows NT 4.0 are retained when
you upgrade the computer to Windows 2000. The disks that make up the
mirror set are initialized as basic. The Disk Management tool offers limited
support for mirror sets on basic disks. You can repair, resynchronize, break,
and delete existing mirror sets, but you cannot create new mirror sets
on basic disks in Windows 2000.</p>

<p>If a basic disk that contains part of a mirror set is disconnected
or fails, the status of the mirror set becomes Failed Redundancy and
the status of the disk remains Online. If this happens, you can try to
repair the volume.</p>

<p><b>Repairing a Mirror Set</b></p>

<p>You must have an additional basic disk with enough space for a new
mirror to repair a mirror set on a basic disk. You cannot use a dynamic
disk to repair a mirror set. If an additional basic disk is not
available, the Repair Volume option is unavailable and you cannot
repair the mirror set.</p>

<p>When you repair a mirror set, the Disk Management tool creates a new
mirror on a separate basic disk and then resynchronizes the new mirror set.
During the repair volume process, the status of the mirror set changes
to Regenerating and then Healthy. If the status does not return to
Healthy, right-click the mirror set and then click Resynchronize
Mirror.</p>

<p>To repair a mirror set on a basic disk, open the Disk Management
tool, right-click the mirror set that you want to repair, click Repair
Volume, and then follow the instructions on your screen.</p>

<p><b>Resynchronizing Mirror Sets</b></p>

<p>Resynchronize a mirror set when data on one of the disks is
incomplete or outdated. If one disk in a mirror set is removed, for
example, data will be written to the remaining disk. The mirror set is then no longer fault tolerant. When you replace the missing disk, you must resynchronize the mirror
set to update the information on the replaced disk. Resynchronize Mirror is an option on
the shortcut (right-click) menu for a mirror set.</p>

<p><b>Breaking Mirror Sets</b></p>

<p>Breaking a mirror set creates two independent partitions or logical
drives. The data is no longer redundant and no data is deleted. For example, if
you determine that the data you store in the mirror set is not vital
enough to require fault tolerance and you need more disk storage space,
you can break the mirror set to use both partitions for storage. To
break a mirror set, open the Disk Management tool, right-click the
mirror set that you want to break, and then click Break Mirror.</p>

<A NAME="545"><H3>Deleting Mirror Sets</H3></A>

<p>When you want to recover the use of both partitions that comprise a
mirror set and do not want to save the data stored in the mirror set,
you can delete the mirror set rather than breaking it. Deleting a
mirror set deletes all of the data that the set contains, in addition
to the partitions that make up the set. You can delete only the entire
mirror set. To delete a mirror set, open the Disk Management tool,
right-click the mirror set that you want to delete, and then click
Delete Volume.</p>

<A NAME="546"><H2>Managing Volume Sets and Stripe Sets on Basic Disks</H2></A>

<p>When you no longer want a volume set or a stripe set, or you have a
problem with a faulty disk drive, you can delete the set. When you have
a problem with a faulty disk drive that is part of a stripe set with
parity, you can attempt to repair the stripe set with parity or delete
it.</p>

<A NAME="547"><H3>Deleting Volume Sets and Stripe Sets</H3></A>

<p>Volume sets and stripe sets that you created with Windows NT 4.0 are
retained when you upgrade the computer to Windows 2000. The disks that
make up the volume set or stripe set are initialized as basic. Disk
Management offers limited support for volume sets and stripe sets on
basic disks. You can delete volume sets and stripe sets, but you cannot
create new ones on basic disks in Windows 2000.</p>

<p>Deleting a volume set or stripe set deletes all of the data that the
set contains, in addition to the partitions that make up the set. You
can delete only entire volume sets and stripe sets. To delete a volume
set or a stripe set, right-click the volume set or stripe set that you
want to delete, and then click Delete Volume.</p>

<A NAME="548"><H3>Repairing and Deleting Stripe Sets with Parity</H3></A>

<p>Stripe sets with parity that you created with Windows NT 4.0 are
retained when you upgrade the computer to Windows 2000. The disks that
make up the stripe set with parity are initialized as basic. Disk
Management provides limited support for stripe sets with parity on
basic disks. You can repair, regenerate the parity of, and delete
stripe sets with parity, but you cannot create new stripe sets with
parity on basic disks in Windows 2000.</p>

<p>If a basic disk that contains part of a stripe set with parity is
disconnected or fails, the status of the stripe set with parity becomes
Failed Redundancy and the status of the disk remains Online. If this
happens, you can try to repair the set. Repairing a stripe set with
parity on a basic disk requires an additional basic disk with
sufficient free space for part of the stripe set with parity. You
cannot use a dynamic disk to repair a stripe set with parity. If an
additional basic disk is not available, the Repair Volume option is
unavailable and you cannot repair the set.</p>

<p>Disk Management relocates part of the stripe set with parity to a
separate basic disk, regenerates the parity, and then returns the
status of the set to Healthy when you repair a stripe set with parity
on a basic disk.</p>

<p>To repair a stripe set with parity on a basic disk, open the Disk
Management tool, right-click the stripe set with parity that you want
to repair, and then click Repair Volume.</p>

<p>During the Repair Volume process, the status of the stripe set with
parity changes to Regenerating and then Healthy. If the status of the
set does not return to Healthy, right-click the stripe set with parity,
and then click Regenerate Parity.</p>

<p>Deleting a stripe set with parity deletes all of the data that the
set contains, in addition to the partitions that make up the set. You can delete only
entire stripe sets with parity. To delete a stripe set with parity on a
basic disk, right-click the stripe set with parity that you want to
delete, and then click Delete Volume.</p>

<A NAME="552"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The Disk Management tool provides a central location for disk
information and management tasks, such as creating and deleting
partitions and volumes. With the proper permissions, you can manage
disks locally and on remote computers. In addition to monitoring disk
information, some of the other disk management tasks that you might
need to perform include adding and removing hard disks and changing the
disk storage type.</p>

<p>Common disk management tasks include upgrading from a basic disk to
a dynamic disk, creating and extending simple volumes, creating and
extending spanned volumes, creating striped volumes, adding disks,
changing storage type, viewing and updating information, and managing
disks on a remote computer. In the practice portion of this lesson, you used the Disk Management tool to upgrade a basic disk to a dynamic disk, to create a new simple volume
and mount the new volume onto an existing folder on another volume, and to
extend a volume.</p>

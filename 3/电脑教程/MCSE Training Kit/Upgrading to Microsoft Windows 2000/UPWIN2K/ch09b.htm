<A NAME="431"><H1>Lesson 1: Understanding the New Authentication Protocols in Windows 2000</H1></A>

<p>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 included support for several authentication
protocols used to verify the credentials of users connecting to the
network. These protocols included the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</li></p>

<p><li>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(MS-CHAP)</li></p>

<p><li>Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP)</li></p>

<p><li>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</li></p>
</ul>


<p>Windows 2000 includes support for these and several additional
protocols that significantly increase your authentication, encryption,
and multilinking options. The new protocols supported by Windows 2000
include Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), Remote Authentication
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec),
Layer-Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)), and Microsoft Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2).</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the new protocols supported by Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="432"><H2>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</H2></A>

<p>EAP allows for an arbitrary authentication mechanism to validate a
dial-in connection. The exact authentication method to be used is
negotiated by the dial-in client and the remote access server. EAP
supports authentication by using the following schemes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Generic token cards.</b> These are physical cards used to
provide passwords. Token cards can use several authentication methods,
such as using codes that change with each use.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Message Digest 5 Challenge Handshake Authentication
Protocol (MD5-CHAP).</b> This protocol encrypts user names and
passwords with an MD5 algorithm.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Transport Level Security (TLS).</b> TLS is used for smart
card support or other certificates. Smart cards require a card and
reader. The smart card electronically stores the user's certificate
and private key.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>Through the use of the EAP application programming interfaces
(APIs), independent software vendors can supply new client and server
authentication modules for technologies such as token cards, smart
cards, biometric hardware such as retina scanners, or one-time password
systems. EAP allows for the support of authentication technologies that
are not yet developed. EAP authentication methods are added on the Security tab of the remote access server's
Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For more information on EAP, see RFC
2284.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="433"><H2>Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)</H2></A>

<p>The diversity of hardware and operating systems in today's
enterprise networks requires remote user authentication to be
vendor-independent and scalable. RADIUS support in Windows 2000 facilitates this kind of user
authentication, while providing highly scalable authentication designs
for performance and fault-tolerant designs for reliability.</p>

<p>RADIUS provides authentication and accounting services for
distributed dial-up networking. Windows 2000 can act as a RADIUS
client, a RADIUS server, or both. A RADIUS client, typically an
Internet service provider (ISP) dial-up server, is a remote access
server receiving authentication requests and forwarding requests to a
RADIUS server. As a RADIUS client, Windows 2000 can also forward accounting information to a RADIUS accounting server.
RADIUS clients are configured on the Security tab in the remote access
server's Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>A RADIUS server validates the RADIUS client request. Windows 2000
Internet Authentication Services (IAS) performs authentication. As a
RADIUS server, IAS stores RADIUS accounting information from RADIUS
clients in log files. IAS is one of the optional components that can be
installed during Windows 2000 installation or at a later time through
Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. IAS can then be found in
Administrative Tools on the Programs menu (via the Start menu).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For additional information on RADIUS, see RFC
2138/2139.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="434"><H2>Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)</H2></A>

<p>IPSec is a framework of open standards for ensuring secure private
communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks by using
cryptographic security services. IPSec provides aggressive protection
against private network and Internet attacks, while retaining ease of
use. Clients negotiate a security association (SA) that acts as a
private key to encrypt the data flow.</p>

<p>Your network security administrator can use IPSec policies, rather
than applications or operations systems, to configure IPSec security
services. The policies provide variable levels of protection for most
traffic types, in most existing networks. Your network security
administrator can configure IPSec policies to meet the security
requirements of a user, group, application, domain, site, or global
enterprise.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 provides an administrative interface, IP Security
Management, to create and manage IPSec policies (centrally at the group
policy level for domain members, or locally on a nondomain computer).
IP Security Management is a tool that you can add to any Microsoft
Management Console (MMC). Configuring IPSec policies is beyond the
scope of this course.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For additional information on security
mechanisms for IP, see RFC 1825.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="435"><H2>Layer-Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)</H2></A>

<p>L2TP is very similar to PPTP in that its primary purpose is to
create an encrypted tunnel through an untrusted network. L2TP differs
from PPTP in that it provides tunneling, but not encryption. L2TP
provides a secure tunnel by cooperating with other encryption
technologies such as IPSec. IPSec does not require L2TP, but its
encryption functions complement L2TP to create a secure virtual private
network (VPN) solution.</p>

<p>Both PPTP and L2TP use PPP to provide an initial envelope for the
data and then append additional headers for transport through the
transit internetwork. Some of the key differences between PPTP and L2TP
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>PPTP requires an IP-based transit internetwork. L2TP
requires only that the tunnel media provide packet-oriented,
point-to-point connectivity. L2TP can use User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
frame relay permanent virtual circuits (PVCs), X.25 virtual circuits
(VCs), or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) VCs to operate over an IP
network.</li></p>

<p><li>L2TP supports header compression; PPTP does not. When header
compression is enabled, L2TP operates with four bytes of overhead,
compared to six bytes for PPTP.</li></p>

<p><li>L2TP supports tunnel authentication, while PPTP does not.
However, when either PPTP or L2TP is used in conjunction with IPSec,
IPSec provides tunnel authentication so that layer-two tunnel
authentication is not necessary.</li></p>

<p><li>PPTP uses PPP encryption. L2TP requires IPSec for
encryption.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The creation of L2TP ports for VPNs is discussed later in this
chapter.</p>

<A NAME="436"><H2>Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)</H2></A>

<p>In Windows NT 4.0, Remote Access Service (RAS) supports basic
multilink capabilities. It allows the combining of multiple physical links into
one logical link. Typically, two or more Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) lines or modem links are bundled together for greater
bandwidth.</p>

<p>In Windows 2000, BAP and Bandwidth Allocation Control Protocol
(BACP) enhance multilink by dynamically adding or dropping links on demand.
BAP is especially valuable to operations that have carrier charges
based on bandwidth utilization. BAP and BACP are sometimes used
interchangeably to refer to bandwidth-on-demand functionality. Both protocols are PPP control
protocols and work together to provide bandwidth on demand. BAP
provides a very efficient mechanism for controlling connection costs
while dynamically providing optimum bandwidth.</p>

<p>You can enable multilink and BAP protocols on a serverwide basis
from the PPP tab of each remote access server's Properties dialog
box. You configure BAP settings through remote access policies. Using these policies, you can
specify that an extra line is dropped if link utilization drops below
75 percent for one group and below 25 percent for another group. Remote
access policies are described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For more information on PPP multilink, see RFC
1990. For more information on BAP/BACP, see RFC 2125.

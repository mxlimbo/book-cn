</ul>

<A NAME="30"><H3>Printing Support</H3></A>

<p>Printing in Windows 2000 Professional has been improved to assist
you in providing a more flexible network of printers. Windows 2000
Professional includes the following printing features and
enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).</b> Allows users to
send documents to any printer in a Microsoft Windows 2000 network that
is connected to the Internet. Internet printing enables users to do the
following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Print to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) over an intranet
or the Internet.</li></p>

<p><li>View printer and job-related information in Hypertext Markup

<p><li><b>Image Color Management (ICM) 2.0.</b> Allows you to send
high-quality color documents to a printer or another computer with
greater speed and reliability than ever before. ICM 2.0 is an operating
system API that helps ensure that the colors you see on your monitor
match those on your scanner and printer.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="31"><H2>Simplified Management</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes many features that help reduce
the overall cost of managing the computing environment, from
installation of the operating system and applications to day-to-day
desktop management and support.</p>

<A NAME="32"><H3>Setup Tools</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 simplifies the process of setting up a computer by
allowing disk duplication. Disk duplication allows you to use the
Windows 2000 System Preparation tool to create an image of a
computer's hard disk. You can then use a third-party tool to
duplicate the hard disk on similarly configured computers.</p>

<A NAME="33"><H3>Configuration Management Capabilities</H3></A>

<p>The configuration management capabilities in Windows 2000 create a
more consistent environment for the end user and help ensure that users
have any data, applications, and operating system settings that they need.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 includes the following configuration management
enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Add/Remove Programs wizard.</b> Simplifies the process of
installing and removing programs. Users can install applications by pointing
directly to a location on the corporate network or Internet. The user
interface provides additional feedback and sort options to view installed or available
applications by size, frequency of use, and time of last use.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Installer service.</b> Manages application
installation, modification, repairs, and removal. It provides a
standard format for managing the components of a software package, and
an application programming interface (API) for managing applications
and tools.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="34"><H3>Troubleshooting Tools</H3></A>

tools that make it easier to support the operating system.
Troubleshooting tools in Windows 2000 Professional include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Upgrade Compatibility Verification tool.</b> Detects and
warns the user if certain installed applications or components will
cause an upgrade to fail or if the components will not work after an
upgrade is complete. When you run the Winnt32 command with the
/checkupgradeonly switch, the Report System Compatibility screen
appears and lists any items found that are not compatible with Windows
2000. For more information on the /checkupgradeonly switch see <a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000.&quot; </li></p>

<p><li><b>Troubleshooters.</b> Troubleshooting wizards that can be
used to solve many common computer problems are included in Windows

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f01up01x.htm')"> <img src="images/f01up01.JPG" width=404 height=320 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.1</b> <i>Enhancements to hardware support</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<ul>
<p><li><b>Add/Remove Hardware wizard.</b> Allows you to add,
remove, troubleshoot, and upgrade computer peripherals. When a device
is not working properly, you can use the wizard to stop operation and
safely remove the device.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Win32 Driver Model (WDM).</b> Provides a common model for
device drivers across Windows 98 and Windows 2000. Drivers that are
written to the WDM will work in both Windows 98 and Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Plug and Play support.</b> Enhances previous Plug and
Play functionality and allows the following:</li></p>

<p><li><b>Power options.</b> Prevent unnecessary power drains on
your system by directing power to devices as they need it. The options
available to you depend on your hardware. These options include the
following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Standby. While on standby, your monitor and hard disks turn
off and your computer uses less power.</li></p>

<p><li>Hibernation. The hibernate feature turns off your monitor and
hard disk, saves everything in memory on disk, and turns off your
computer. When you restart your computer, your desktop is restored
exactly as you left it.</li></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Microsoft Windows 2000 also supports DirectX
7.0, which provides low-level application programming interfaces (APIs)
that give access to high-performance media acceleration on Microsoft
Windows-based computers.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="36"><H2>Symmetric Multiprocessing</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 is a multiprocessing operating system capable of
running on computers containing more than one processor. Windows 2000
Professional provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system
capabilities and supports two processors. It assumes that all of the
processors are equal and that they all have access to the same physical
memory. Therefore, Windows 2000 can run any thread on any available
processor regardless of which process, user or executive, owns the
thread.</p>

<p>The design of Windows 2000 also supports processor affinity, whereby
a process or thread can specify that it is to run on a particular set
of processors. As with previous versions of Windows NT, Windows 2000
includes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that a process can
use for processor affinity. These APIs must be defined in the
application to make use of processor affinity.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 uses the same rules for scheduling on a multiprocessor
system as it does on a single-processor system. Therefore, at any given
time, the threads that are ready and have the highest priorities are
actually running.</p>

<A NAME="37"><H2>Asymmetric Multiprocessing</H2></A>

<p>There are also asymmetric multiprocessing (ASMP) systems in which
processors are different. They may address different physical memory
spaces, or they may have other differences. These operating systems
only run certain processes on certain processors. For example, the
kernel might always execute on a particular processor. Windows 2000
does not support ASMP.</p>

<A NAME="38"><H2>Enhanced File Management</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional provides significant enhancements to file
management capabilities. Features that enhance file management in
Windows 2000 Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>NTFS file system.</b> Supports file encryption and
enables you to add disk space to an NTFS volume without having to
restart the computer. It also supports distributed link tracking, and
per-user disk quotas to monitor and limit disk space use.</li></p>

<p><li><b>FAT32 file system.</b> Supports FAT32 file system for
compatibility with Windows 95 Operating System Release (OSR) 2 systems
and later. FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system for use
on disk volumes larger than 2 GB.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk Defragmenter utility.</b> Rearranges files,
programs, and unused space on your computer's hard disk so that
programs run faster and files open more quickly.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Backup utility.</b> Helps to protect data from accidental
loss due to hardware or storage media failure. The backup utility in Windows 2000 allows
you to schedule backups to occur automatically. You can back up data to
a wide variety of storage media, such as the following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Tape drives</li></p>

<p><li>External hard disks</li></p>

<p><li>Zip disks</li></p>

<p><li>Recordable CD-ROMs</li></p>

<p><li>Logical drives</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li><b>Volume Mount Points.</b> Allows you to connect, or mount,
a local drive at any empty folder on a local NTFS-formatted
volume.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="39"><H2>Enhanced Security Features</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is the most secure Windows desktop
operating system for either a stand-alone computer or any type of
public or private network. Security features and enhancements in
Windows 2000 Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Kerberos 5.</b> Supports single logon, allowing faster
authentication and faster network response. Kerberos 5 is the primary
security protocol for domains in Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Encrypting File System (EFS).</b> Strengthens security by
encrypting files on your hard disk so that no one can access them
without using the correct password.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Internet Protocol Security (IPSec).</b> Encrypts
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic to
secure communications within an intranet and provides the highest
levels of security for virtual private network (VPN) traffic across the
Internet.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Smart card support.</b> Enables portability of
credentials and other private information between computers at work, home, or on the road. This
eliminates the need to transmit sensitive information, such as
authentication tickets and private keys, over networks.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="40"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional improves the capabilities of previous
versions of Windows in five main areas: ease of use, simplified
management, increased hardware support, enhanced file management, and
enhanced security features.</p>

<p>Some of the ease of use improvements include enhancements to the
user interface, such as a customized Start menu that presents only the
programs that you use most often, and improved logon and shutdown
dialog boxes. Windows 2000 Professional includes support for the latest
laptop technologies based on ACPI and provides a Network Connections
wizard and VPN support. It provides offline folders that allow you to
copy documents stored on the network to your local computer for access
when you are offline, and it provides a Synchronization Manager that
compares items on the network to items that you opened or updated while
working offline and synchronizes them.</p>

<p>Printing in Windows 2000 Professional has also been improved.
Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) allows users to print to a URL over an
intranet or the Internet, view printer and job-related information in
HTML format from any browser, and download and install printer drivers
over the Internet. The Windows 2000 Add Printer wizard simplifies the
process of connecting to local and network printers from within a
program, and Image Color Management 2.0 allows you to send high-quality
color documents to a printer or another computer with greater speed and
reliability than ever before.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 also simplifies the process of setting up a computer.
The Windows 2000 System Preparation Tool allows you to create an image of a
computer's hard disk so that you can use a third-party tool to
duplicate the hard disk on similarly configured computers. The Setup
Manager wizard guides you through the process of creating answer files
for unattended installation scripts.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional now supports more than 7,000
hardware devices, such as infrared devices, scanners, digital cameras,
and advanced multimedia devices. Other enhancements to hardware support
include an Add/Remove Hardware wizard that allows you to add, remove,
troubleshoot, and upgrade computer peripherals; a Win32 Driver Model
that allows device drivers written to the WDM to work in both Windows
98 and Windows 2000; enhanced Plug and Play support; power options that
prevent unnecessary power drains on your system by directing power to
devices as they need it; and support for Direct-X 7.0</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional enhancements to file management
capabilities include a disk defragmenter utility and an NTFS file system that
supports file encryption, distributed link tracking, and per-user disk quotas to
monitor and limit disk space use. There is a backup utility that allows
you to back up data to a wide variety of storage media: tape drives,
external hard disks, zip disks, recordable CD-ROMs, and logical
drives.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is the most secure Windows desktop
operating system for either a stand-alone computer or any type of
public or private network. Security features and enhancements in
Windows 2000 Professional include support for Kerberos 5; EFS, which strengthens security by encrypting
files on your hard disk; and IPSec, which encrypts TCP/IP traffic and
provides the highest levels of security for VPN traffic across the
Internet.</p>

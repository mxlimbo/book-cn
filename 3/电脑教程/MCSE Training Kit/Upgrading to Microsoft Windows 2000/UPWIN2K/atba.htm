<A NAME="1"><H1>About This Book</H1></A>

<p>Welcome to <i>Upgrading to Microsoft Windows 2000 Training Kit</i>.
This kit introduces you to the Windows 2000 family of products,
prepares you to install the Windows 2000 software, and prepares you to
upgrade your Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 network to a Windows 2000
network.</p>

<p>This kit concentrates on Windows 2000 Server and on Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), the network protocol of choice for
Windows 2000. It also emphasizes the Domain Name System (DNS), which is
an Internet and TCP/IP standard name service and required for Windows
2000 domains and directory services based on Active Directory
technology. Active Directory directory services integrate the Internet
concept of a namespace with Windows 2000 directory services. Active
Directory directory services use DNS as the domain naming and location
service, so Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS names. In fact, the
core unit of logical structure in Active Directory directory services is the domain. In this kit, you will learn how to install, navigate, and administer the Windows 2000 Active Directory directory services.</p>

<p>This course also supports the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer
program.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For more information on becoming a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, see the section titled &quot;<A HREF="atbd.htm#13">The Microsoft Certified Professional Program</A>&quot; later in this
introduction.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The &quot;<A HREF="atbc.htm#9">Getting Started</A>&quot; section of this introduction
provides important setup instructions that describe the hardware and software requirements to
complete the procedures in this course. It also provides information
about the networking configuration necessary to complete some of the
hands-on procedures. Read through this section thoroughly before you
start the lessons.</p>

<A NAME="2"><H2>Intended Audience</H2></A>
<p>Anyone who wants to learn more about Windows 2000 will find this
book useful. However, this book was primarily designed for people
currently administering and supporting Windows NT 4.0. This book was
developed for information system (IS) professionals who need to plan
upgrades, perform or manage the transition of Windows NT 4.0 networks
to Windows 2000 networks, and support these networks before, during,
and after the upgrade to Windows 2000</p>

<A NAME="3"><H2>Prerequisites</H2></A>

<ul>
<p><li>Experience administering or supporting a Windows NT 4.0
network</li></p>

<p><li>A thorough knowledge of TCP/IP and Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</li></p>

<p><li>Experience creating and managing user accounts and
controlling access to resources in a Windows NT 4.0 network</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="4"><H2>Features of This Book</H2></A>

<p>Each chapter opens with a &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section,
which prepares you for completing the chapter.</p>

<p><li>Each chapter is divided into lessons. Many step-by-step
practices are provided for you to perform the procedures on your test
machine to help you learn the different facets of administering a
Windows 2000 network. These practices are placed at the end of lessons
and consist of one or more exercises or procedures. Each procedure is
marked with a bullet as shown at the beginning of this paragraph.</p>

<p>Some additional procedures are placed outside the practices in the
general text material to outline techniques in a more general way or to
present procedures that can't be carried out with the minimum
hardware configuration required for this Training Kit. You will find
the minimum hardware requirements for this Training Kit listed later
under &quot;<A HREF="atbc.htm#10">Hardware Requirements</A>&quot; in the &quot;<A HREF="atbc.htm#9">Getting Started</A>&quot; section of this chapter.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
The additional procedures that are not
included within the practice sections are intended as general
information to advance your knowledge of Windows 2000. Because many of the practices build upon procedures you
do in earlier practices, if you work through the additional procedures
in the general text of the book you may alter the state of your test
machine and may not be able to carry out subsequent practices exactly
as they are presented.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Each lesson ends with a short summary of the lesson material. The
&quot;Review&quot; section at the end of the chapter allows you to test
what you have learned in the chapter. <a href="chaaa.htm">Appendix A</a>, &quot;Questions and Answers,&quot; contains all of the book's practice questions and
review questions and the corresponding answers.</p>

<A NAME="5"><H3>Notes</H3></A>

<p>Notes appear throughout the lessons. There are several types, which
are described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Notes marked <b>Important</b> contain information that is
essential to completing a task.</li></p>

<p><li>Notes marked <b>Note</b> contain supplemental
information.</li></p>

<p><li>Notes marked <b>Caution</b> contain warnings about possible
loss of data.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="6"><H3>Conventions</H3></A>

<p>This book uses the following conventions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Hands-on procedures that you may follow are presented in
numbered lists of steps (1, 2, and so on). A bullet indicates the beginning of a procedure.</li></p>

<p><li>The word <i>select</i> is used for highlighting folders,
filenames, text boxes, menu bars, and option buttons, and for selecting
options in a dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li>The word <i>click</i> is used for carrying out a command
from a menu or dialog box.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="7"><H3>Notational Conventions</H3></A>

<p>This book uses the following notational conventions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Characters or commands that you type appear in <b>bold
lowercase</b> type.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Italic</i> in syntax statements indicates placeholders
for variable information. <i>Italic</i> is also used for book
titles.</li></p>

<p><li>Names of files and folders appear in title caps, except when
you are to type them directly. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use
all lowercase letters when you type a filename in a dialog box or at a
command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>Filename extensions when used alone appear in all uppercase
characters (for example, .DOC); filename extension in filenames appear
in lowercase.</li></p>

<p><li>Acronyms appear in all uppercase.</li></p>

<p><li>Monospace type represents code samples, examples of screen
text, or entries that you might type at a command prompt or in
initialization files.</li></p>

<p><li>Square brackets [ ] are used in syntax statements to enclose
optional items. For example, [<i>filename</i>] in command syntax
indicates that you can choose to type a filename with the command. Type
only the information within the brackets, not the brackets
themselves.</li></p>

<p><li>Braces { } are used in syntax statements to enclose required
items. Type only the information within the braces, not the braces
themselves.</li></p>

<p><li>Icons represent specific sections in the book as
follows:</li></p>


<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">
<th>Icon</th>
<th>Represents</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/practic.JPG" width=68 height=54 border="0"></td>
<td valign="top">A hands-on practice. You should perform the practice to give  yourself an opportunity to use the skills being presented in the  lesson.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/quest.JPG" width=59 height=41 border="0"></td>
<td valign="top">Chapter review questions. These questions at the end of each  chapter allow you to test what you have learned in the lessons.  You will find the answers to the review questions in <a href="chaaa.htm">Appendix A</a>,  &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; at the end of the book.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
</ul>

<p><b>Keyboard Conventions</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must
press those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press Alt+Tab&quot; means that you hold down Alt while you press Tab.</li></p>

<p><li>A comma ( , ) between two or more key names means that you
must press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example,
&quot;Press Alt, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key
in sequence. &quot;Press Alt+W, L&quot; means that you first press Alt
and W together, and then release them and press L.</li></p>

<p><li>You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the
Alt key to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that
correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and the
command name. For some commands, you can also press a key combination
listed on the menu.</li></p>

<p><li>You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in
dialog boxes with the keyboard. Press the Alt key, and then press the key that
corresponds to the underlined letter of the option name. Or you can
press Tab until the option is highlighted, and then press the Spacebar
to select or clear the check box or option button.</li></p>
</ul>

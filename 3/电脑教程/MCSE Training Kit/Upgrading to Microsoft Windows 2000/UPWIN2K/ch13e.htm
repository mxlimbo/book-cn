<A NAME="643"><H1>Lesson 4: Upgrading Client Operating Systems</H1></A>

<p>You upgrade most Windows client operating systems directly to
Windows 2000 in order to take advantage of the new features offered in
Windows 2000 Professional operating system. However, before upgrading
client operating systems to Windows 2000, you must ensure that the
computer hardware meets the minimum Windows 2000 hardware requirements.
You must also check the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) or test the
computers for hardware compatibility using the Windows 2000
Compatibility tool. You want to ensure the hardware is compatible with
Windows 2000 so that there are no surprises when you start the upgrade
on a large number of client computers.</p>

<p>For client systems that use compatible hardware, you upgrade them
directly to Windows 2000. If there are Windows 95 and 98 client systems
using incompatible or insufficient hardware, you can still take
advantage of the Active Directory functionality on these systems by
using the Windows 2000 Directory Services Client.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to upgrade older Windows client operating
systems to Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>

</p>

<A NAME="644"><H2>Identifying Client Upgrade Paths</H2></A>

<p>You can upgrade most client computers running older versions of
Windows directly to Windows 2000. However, computers running Windows NT 3.1
or 3.5 require an additional step. Table 13.4 lists the Windows 2000
Professional upgrade paths for client operating systems.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Windows 2000 Professional also upgrades all
released service packs for Windows NT Workstation 3.51 and
4.0.

<A NAME="645"><H2>Identifying the Minimum Hardware Requirements</H2></A>

<p>Before you upgrade a client computer to Windows 2000 Professional,
make sure that it meets the minimum hardware requirements. Table 13.5
describes these hardware requirements.</p>

<A NAME="646"><H2>Generating a Hardware Compatibility Report</H2></A>

<p>You generate a hardware and software compatibility report using the
Windows 2000 Compatibility tool. This tool runs automatically during
system upgrades, but it is recommended that you run this tool before
beginning the upgrade to identify any hardware and software problems.
This is especially true when upgrading many computers with similar hardware, so compatibility
problems can be fixed before the upgrade begins.</p>

<A NAME="647"><H3>Generating the Report</H3></A>

<p>To generate a compatibility report using the Windows 2000
Compatibility tool, select Run on the Start menu and type <b>Winnt32/checkupgradeonly</b>. 
By using the /checkupgradeonly switch, Winnt32
launches the first part of the Windows 2000 setup program. Instead of
running the entire setup process, it only checks for compatible
hardware and software. This generates a report that you can analyze to
determine what system components are Windows 2000-compatible.</p>

<A NAME="648"><H3>Reviewing the Report</H3></A>

<p>The report generated by running Winnt32 /checkupgradeonly is a text
document, named Winnt32.log. It is created in the installation
directory; you can view it in the tool or save it as a text file.</p>

<p>The report documents the system hardware and software that is
incompatible with Windows 2000. It also identifies whether you need to
obtain an upgrade pack for software installed on the system and any
additional changes or modifications you must make to the system to
maintain functionality in Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="649"><H2>Upgrading Compatible Windows 95 and Windows 98 Computers</H2></A>

<p>For client systems that test as compatible with Windows 2000, you
run the Windows 2000 setup program (winnt32.exe) to complete the upgrade
process.</p>

<p>To upgrade Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Run the winnt32.exe command.</li></p>

<p><li>Accept the license agreement.</li></p>

<p><li>If the computer you are upgrading is already a member of a
domain, you must create a computer account in that domain. Windows 95
and 98 clients do not require a computer account, but Windows 2000
Professional clients do.</li></p>

<p><li>You are asked to provide upgrade packs for any applications that
might need them. Upgrade packs update software so it works with Windows
2000. Upgrade packs are available from the software vendor.</li></p>

<p><li>You are prompted to upgrade to NTFS. Select the upgrade if you
do not plan to set up the client computer to dual boot.</li></p>

<p><li>The Windows 2000 Compatibility tool runs, generating a report.
If the report shows the computer as Windows 2000-compatible, continue
with the upgrade. If the report shows the computer to be incompatible
with Windows 2000, terminate the upgrade process.</li></p>

<p><li>The upgrade finishes without further user intervention. After
the upgrade is complete, you must enter the password for the local
computer Administrator account.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>If your computer is Windows 2000-compatible, it is now upgraded and
is a member of your domain. If your computer is not Windows
2000-compatible, you must upgrade your hardware, if possible, or you can install the
Directory Service Client.</p>

<A NAME="650"><H2>Installing the Directory Service Client</H2></A>

<p>Windows 95 or Windows 98 computers that do not meet the hardware
compatibility requirements can still take advantage of Active Directory
directory services by using the Directory Service Client. The Directory Service
Client upgrades Windows 95 and 98 systems so that they support Active
Directory features, including the ability to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Use fault-tolerant Dfs</li></p>

<p><li>Search Active Directory directory services</li></p>

<p><li>Change your password on any domain controller</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Before installing the Directory Service Client
on a computer running Windows 95, you must install Internet Explorer 4.01 or greater and
enable the Active Desktop component. Otherwise, the Directory Service
Client Setup wizard will not run.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>To install the Directory Service Client on a non-Windows 2000
compatible computer, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the \Clients\Win9x folder of the Windows 2000 Server
or Advanced Server beta CD-ROM, run the dsclient.exe command.</li></p>


<p>The Directory Service Client Setup wizard starts.</p>


<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>


<p>The Ready To Install page appears, prompting you to confirm that you
want to install Directory Service Client.</p>


<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>


<p>The Installation page appears and displays an indicator as files are
copied to the hard disk.</p>


<p><li>Click Finish to complete the installation.</li></p>

<p><li>When prompted, click Yes to restart the computer.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="651"><H2>Upgrading Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 Clients</H2></A>

<p>The upgrade process for computers running Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 is
similar to the upgrade process for computers running Windows 95 and
Windows 98.</p>

<A NAME="652"><H3>Verifying Compatibility</H3></A>

<p>Before you perform the upgrade, you must verify that the systems are
compatible with Windows 2000. Use the Windows 2000 Compatibility tool
to identify any potential problems before you start the upgrade.</p>

<A NAME="653"><H3>Upgrading Compatible Systems</H3></A>

<p>Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 computers that meet the hardware
compatibility requirements can upgrade directly to Windows 2000. To perform the
upgrade process, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Insert the Windows 2000 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start, and then click Run.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Run box, type <b><i>X</i>:\i386\winnt32</b> and then
press Enter (where <i>X</i> is the drive letter for your CD-ROM
drive).</li></p>


<p>The Welcome To The Windows 2000 Setup Wizard page appears.</p>


<p><li>Click Upgrade To Windows 2000 (Recommended) and then click
Next.</li></p>


<p>The License Agreement page is displayed.</p>


<p><li>Read the license agreement and then click I Accept This
Agreement.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>


<p>The Upgrading to the Windows 2000 NTFS File System page appears.</p>


<p><li>Click Yes, Upgrade My Drive, and then click Next.</li></p>


<p>The Copying Installation Files page appears.</p>

<p>The Restarting The Computer page appears and the computer will now
restart.</p>
</ol>

<p>The upgrade finishes without further user intervention.</p>

<A NAME="654"><H3>Using Incompatible Systems</H3></A>

<p>Computers running Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0 that do not meet
the hardware compatibility requirements can still log on to a Windows
2000 network, but they will not be able to take advantage of many of
the Windows 2000 features. No Directory Services Client is available
for computers running Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="655"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You can upgrade most client computers running older versions of
Windows directly to Windows 2000. However, computers running Windows NT 3.1 or
Windows NT 3.5 must first be upgraded to Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT
4.0, and then you can upgrade them to Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>Before you upgrade a client computer to Windows 2000 Professional,
make sure that it meets the minimum hardware requirements. You can
generate a hardware and software compatibility report using the Windows
2000 Compatibility tool. This tool runs automatically during system
upgrades, but it is recommended that you run this tool before beginning the upgrade to identify any
hardware and software problems. This is especially true when upgrading many
computers with similar hardware, so compatibility problems can be fixed
before the upgrade begins.</p>

<p>For client systems that test as compatible with Windows 2000, you
run the Windows 2000 setup program (winnt32.exe) to complete the upgrade
process. If your computer is not Windows 2000-compatible, you must upgrade your
hardware, if possible, or you can install the Directory Service Client.
Windows 95 or Windows 98 computers that do not meet the hardware compatibility
requirements can still take advantage of Active Directory by using the
Directory Service Client. The Directory Service Client upgrades Windows
95 and 98 systems so that they support Active Directory features,
including the ability to use fault-tolerant Dfs, search Active Directory directory services, and change
your password on any domain controller.</p>

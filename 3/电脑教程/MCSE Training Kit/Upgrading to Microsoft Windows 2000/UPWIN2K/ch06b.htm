<A NAME="295"><H1>Lesson 1: Understanding Group Policy</H1></A>

<p>You can lower your network's total cost of ownership (TCO) by
using Group Policy in Microsoft Windows 2000 to create a managed
desktop environment that is tailored to the user's job
responsibilities and experience level. TCO is the cost that is involved
in administering distributed personal computer networks. Recent studies
on TCO cite lost user productivity as one of the major costs to
corporations. Lost productivity is often due to user error, such as
modifying system configuration files and thereby rendering the computer unusable. Group
Policy provides the network administrator with greater control over
computer configurations, thus reducing the potential for lost user
productivity.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the capabilities and structure of Group Policy,
including Group Policy Objects (GPOs), Group Policy Containers (GPCs),
and Group Policy Templates (GPTs).</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="296"><H2>Group Policy Settings</H2></A>

<p>Group Policy in Windows 2000 allows an administrator to establish a
requirement for a user or a computer once and have that requirement
continually enforced. For example, the administrator can implement group policy
settings that will run a startup script on all computers in an
organizational unit (OU) or audit all failed logon attempts in a
domain.</p>

<p>You use the Group Policy tool and its extensions in Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) to define group policy settings for desktop
configurations for computers and users. You can specify group policy
settings with the following Group Policy extensions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Administrative Templates (Computers) and Administrative
Templates (Users).</b> The Administrative Templates extensions allow
you to control the registry-based group policy settings that configure
the application settings and customize desktop appearances and behavior
of system services.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Folder Redirection Editor.</b> The Folder Redirection
Editor extension allows you to redirect folders like My Documents to
network locations, so that users' folders are stored on the network
rather than on the user's local computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Internet Explorer Maintenance.</b> The Internet Explorer
Maintenance extension allows you to administer Internet Explorer
settings.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Remote Installation Services.</b> The Remote Installation
Services extension allows you to predefine configuration options such as operating system selection and client computer naming conventions to provide better
disaster recovery and easier operating system and application
management.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Scripts (Logon/Logoff) and Scripts
(Startup/Shutdown).</b> The Scripts extensions allow you to configure scripts for when a computer
starts and shuts down and when a user logs on and logs off.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Security Settings.</b> The Security Settings extension
extends the Group Policy snap-in and allows you to define security policies for
computers in your domain.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Software Installation (Computers) and Software
Installation (Users).</b> The Software Installation extensions allow
you to control the central management of software including
installation, updates, and removal.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="297"><H2>Group Policy Objects</H2></A>

<p>In Windows 2000, you create a Group Policy Object (GPO) and then
configure the settings for that specific GPO. The GPO is a virtual
storage location for the group policy settings. The contents of the GPO
are stored in two different locations, the Group Policy Container and
the Group Policy Template.</p>

<A NAME="298"><H3>Group Policy Container</H3></A>

<p>The Group Policy Container (GPC) is an Active Directory object that
contains GPO attributes and includes subcontainers for group policy
information about computers and users. The GPC includes the following
information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Version information.</b> Ensures that the information in
the GPC synchronizes with the Group Policy Template information.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Status information.</b> Indicates whether the GPO is
enabled or disabled.</li></p>

<p><li><b>List of components (extensions).</b> Lists any of the
Group Policy extensions that are used in the GPO.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="299"><H3>Group Policy Template</H3></A>

<p>The Group Policy Template (GPT) is a folder hierarchy in the Sysvol
folder on domain controllers. The GPT is the container for all group policy
information on administrative templates, security, software installation, scripts,
and folder redirection.</p>

<p>When you create a GPO, Windows 2000 creates the corresponding GPT
folder hierarchy. The name of the GPT folder is the globally unique
identifier (GUID) of the GPO that you created.</p>

<p>For example, if you associate a GPO with the domain domain.com, and
the GPO is assigned a GUID of {A3A2C853-F033-11D1-9BE4-00C0DFE00C63},
the resulting GPT folder name would be <i>systemroot</i>\Sysvol\Sysvol\domain.com\
Policies\{A3A2C853-F033-11D1-9BE4-00C0DFE00C63}</p>

<A NAME="300"><H2>Group Policy Inheritance</H2></A>

<p>When you create a GPO, you associate it with a selected Active
Directory container, such as a site, domain, or organizational unit.
Within the hierarchical structure of the Active Directory directory
services, child containers inherit GPOs from parent containers. You
must understand the processing order of GPOs to plan your group policy
implementation. You can filter the scope of the GPO and delegate
control of a GPO with permissions. The attributes of a GPO offer you
other options for managing how you apply group policy settings.</p>

<p>Group policy settings are inherited, cumulative, and affect all
computers and user accounts in the Active Directory container with
which the GPO is associated. You can associate multiple Active
Directory containers with the same GPO and multiple GPOs with a single
Active Directory container.</p>

<A NAME="301"><H3>Understanding Order of Inheritance</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 evaluates GPOs starting with the Active Directory
container furthest away (highest up the hierarchical structure) from the computer
or user. The order of group policy inheritance is site, domain, and
then organizational unit. With this order, the GPOs of the OU that the
computer or user is a member of are the final group policy settings
that Windows 2000 applies to the computer or user.</p>

<p>This default behavior allows a group policy setting in the Active
Directory container closest to the computer or user to override a
conflicting group policy setting in a container that is higher up in
the Active Directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>When a group policy setting is configured for a parent OU, and the
same group policy setting is not configured for a child OU, the objects
in the child OU inherit the group policy setting from the parent OU.
However, a group policy setting can be configured in the GPO for both
the parent and child OU. In that case, the compatibility of the group
policy settings determines the result.</p>

<p>When the parent OU and child OU both have a configured group policy
setting and the settings are compatible, the settings from both OUs
apply. If a group policy setting that is configured for a parent OU is
incompatible with the same group policy setting that is configured for
a child OU, the child OU does not inherit the group policy setting from the parent, but retains its own
group policy setting.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
A GPO that is linked to a site affects all
computers in that site, regardless of the domain to which the computers
belong. The GPO, however, is only stored in one domain. Because a
single site can include multiple domains, a GPO that is associated with
a site can be inherited by computers in multiple domains. All computers
in the site must contact a domain controller in the domain that
contains the GPO. You should consider the network traffic implications
when you create a site GPO.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="302"><H2>Order of Processing GPO Settings</H2></A>

<p>The group policy settings in a GPO are processed in a specific
order. Some group policy settings for users can affect computers also.
For example, the permission to use the Run command on the Start menu
can affect computers and users both. By understanding the order in
which Windows 2000 processes group policy settings, you can avoid
overwriting settings.</p>

<p>The group policy settings are processed in the following
sequence:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>When the computer starts, group policy settings for computers
process. This is done synchronously by default.</li></p>

<p><li>Startup scripts run synchronously by default. This means that
each script must complete or time out before the next one will
start.</li></p>

<p><li>When a user logs on, group policy settings for users process.
This is also done synchronously by default.</li></p>

<p><li>Logon scripts run. Logon scripts in GPOs run asynchronously by
default. If you have scripts that are associated with a user object,
they run last.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can modify the synchronous and asynchronous
processing of both group policies and scripts with a group policy
setting.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Windows 2000 periodically refreshes group policy settings throughout
the network. This is done by default on client computers every 90
minutes with a randomized offset of plus or minus 30 minutes. For
domain controllers, the default period is every 5 minutes. You can
change the default values by modifying the settings in Administrative
Templates. You cannot schedule the application of a GPO to the client
computers.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The processing of software installation and
folder redirection settings in a GPO occurs <i>only</i> when a computer
starts or when the user logs on, rather than on a periodic
basis.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="303"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Group Policy tool allows an administrator to manage
desktop environments throughout the network by applying configuration
settings to computers and users within a site, domain, or
organizational unit. Group policy settings are contained in Group
Policy Objects. A GPO is a virtual storage location for the group
policy settings whose contents are stored in two different locations,
the Group Policy Container and the Group Policy Template.</p>

<p>You use the Group Policy tool and its extensions in MMC to define
group policy settings for desktop configurations for computers and
users. The extensions available for Group Policy include Administrative
Templates, (Computers), Administrative Templates (Users), Folder Redirection Editor, Internet
Explorer Maintenance, Remote Installation Services, Scripts
(Logon/Logoff), Scripts (Startup/Shutdown), Security Settings, Software
Installation (Computers), and Software Installation (Users). These extensions allow you to
specify additional group policy settings. The settings contained in the
GPOs are applied in a specific order. When the computer is started, the group policy
settings for the computers process. Next any startup scripts run. When a user logs
on, the group policy settings for users process, and finally, if there
are any logon scripts, they run.</p>

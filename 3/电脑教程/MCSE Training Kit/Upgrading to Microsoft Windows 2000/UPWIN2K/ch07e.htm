<A NAME="367"><H1>Lesson 4: Managing Software</H1></A>

<p>Without the management controls built into Software Installation,
the value of having users automatically install software would have to
be weighed against potential software installation hazards. Those
hazards could include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Users encountering new file extensions (such as .GIF) that
could install a number of different applications (such as Adobe
Photoshop or Microsoft Internet Explorer)</li></p>

<p><li>Users installing every program listed in Add/Remove
Programs, whether they actually needed the programs or not</li></p>

<p><li>Users being reassigned to positions that precluded the use
of software that was installed for use only in their previous
positions</li></p>
</ul>


<p>To address these problems, Software Installation includes a number
of options for managing software after it has been deployed. In
particular, administrators have the ability to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Associate file extensions with applications</li></p>

<p><li>Prevent software from being installed through document
invocation</li></p>

<p><li>Control the programs listed in Add/Remove Programs in
Control Panel</li></p>

<p><li>Categorize programs listed in Add/Remove Programs in Control
Panel</li></p>

<p><li>Automatically uninstall software whenever a GPO no longer
applies to an individual user</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to manage software using Software Installation
group policies by configuring deployment options, managing file
extension associations, and assigning software categories.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="368"><H2>Associating File Extensions with Applications</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services include a list of file
extensions and the applications associated with those extensions. This
is the list used by the Windows Installer whenever a user double-clicks
an unknown file type. System administrators cannot dictate the contents
of this list, but they can determine the priority for installing
applications upon document invocation.</p>

<p>For example, your organization could deploy Word 97, Word 2000, and
Lotus Word Pro. Each word processor might be preferred in a different
department, but all three of these programs use the .DOC file
extension. You need to adjust the file extension priorities for each
department so that users always receive the correct word processor.</p>

<p>To modify file extension priorities, open the GPO used to deploy the
application. Expand User Configuration, right-click Software
Installation, and then click Properties. In the Software Installation
Properties dialog box, select the File Extensions tab and use the Up button and the Down button to set the
priority order. The first application listed will be the first application
installed. Application associations are managed on a per-GPO basis.
Changing the priority order in a GPO affects only those users who have that GPO applied to
them.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can only associate document types with
applications that have been deployed using Group Policy. For example,
you cannot associate the .DOC file extension with WordPad unless you
create a package file for deploying WordPad.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="369"><H2>Creating Software Categories</H2></A>

<p>Administrators can categorize the software deployed in their
organizations. This allows users to choose from categories in Add/Remove Programs such
as &quot;Graphics&quot; or &quot;Microsoft Office&quot; (see Figure
7.2) rather than from a long and arbitrary list of applications (see
Figure 7.3).</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.3</b> <i>Add/Remove Programs listing all published applications</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Software categories function on an Active Directory-wide basis. You
can gain access to the Categories tab from within any OU. However, any
changes you make will be reflected throughout Active Directory
directory services.</p>

<p>You create a category by editing the GPO for any OU. Expand Software
Settings, for either Computer Configuration or User Configuration.
Right-click Software Installation, and select Properties. In the
Software Installation Properties dialog box, click the Categories tab.
Click the Add button, the Modify button, or the Remove button to create, edit, or remove a category.</p>

<p>You can assign a software package to a category at the time you
deploy the application, or you can assign it anytime thereafter.
Packages can also be listed under more than one category. You assign a
package to a category from the Categories tab in the package's
Properties dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="370"><H2>Modifying Deployment Options</H2></A>

<p>To change the deployment options for an application, right-click the
package file-name in Software Installation, and then click Properties.
When the Properties dialog box appears, click the Deployment tab and
set any combination of the options listed in Table 7.3.</p>

<p><b>Table 7.3</b> <i>Deployment Tab Options</i></p>

<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Option  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Deployment Type  </td>
<td valign="top">You can change the deployment type for an application, changing an application from assigned to published, or vice-versa. This will affect new installations of the application, but will not affect users who have already installed the program.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Auto-Install This Application By File Extension Activation</td>
<td valign="top">Normally, applications are installed upon document invocation. There might be times, however, when you  don't want applications to  automatically install. If so,  you can turn off Auto-Install, but only for published applications.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Uninstall This Application When It Falls Out Of The Scope Of Management </td>
<td valign="top">Administrators can choose to have applications uninstall when the deployment's GPO no longer applies to a  particular user or group of users. For example, suppose  Mary is a member of the Accounting OU, and accounting has been assigned Excel. If Mary is moved to the  Human Resources OU, the Excel GPO will no longer  apply to her. Administrators can decide whether to leave  Excel on her computer or have it automatically uninstalled after she changes OUs. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Do Not Display This Package In The Add/Remove Programs Control Panel </td>
<td valign="top">One way to restrict the ability of users to install software  is to prevent the application from being displayed in Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. Users can still install software by document invocation or by accessing  an advertised shortcut. However, they won't be able to  install the software unless they actually need to use it.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Installation User Interface Options </td>
<td valign="top">Native Windows Installer packages often come with
two different setup interfaces. The basic interface installs the software using default values. The maximum interface prompts the user to enter values. Administrators can choose which interface to expose to users during setup.  Repackaged applications generally offer only a basic  interface.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="371"><H2>Resolving Common Problems</H2></A>

<p>You might encounter problems when deploying software with Group
Policy. Here are some suggested strategies for resolving some of the
more common problems you might encounter.</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Verify that the application appears in Add/Remove
Programs.</b> If applications do not appear as expected, this is likely
because of a problem in how those applications were deployed. To
determine whether an application has been assigned or published to a
user, log on as that user and start Add/Remove Programs. If the application appears in Add/Remove Programs
but there is no Start menu shortcut, it means the application has been
published rather than assigned. If the application does not appear in
Add/Remove Programs, the application was never deployed, it was deployed in
the wrong OU, or the user is a member of a security group that is being
filtered out from the effects of this GPO.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Verify that the user has access to the network
distribution point.</b> Sometimes an application cannot be installed
because a user cannot gain access to the network distribution point
(for example, the server hosting that network might be unavailable).
You can verify access to the network distribution point by clicking
Start, clicking Run, and then typing in the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name of the shared folder and clicking OK. For
example, to verify access to a folder called Software located on a
server named Server1, type the following: <b>\\Server1\Software</b>.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Check for group policy conflicts.</b> It's possible
to assign a user an application at one level of the Active Directory
directory services (for example, the domain) and then deny them access
to that application at a lower level (for example, an OU). If
applications are not showing up as expected, it might be due to a group
policy conflict. In addition, applications can also be assigned to
computers, and computer policy always overrides user policy. If a user
has been assigned Word, but Word has been marked for mandatory removal
from a computer, that user will not get Word if he or she logs on from
that computer.</li></p>
</ul>

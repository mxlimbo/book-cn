<p>Your installation of Windows 2000 should complete without any
problems. However, this lesson covers some common issues that you might
encounter during installation.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Troubleshoot Windows 2000 installations.</li></p>

<p>Table 2.4 lists some common installation problems and offers
solutions to resolve them.</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Problem</th> <th valign="top">Solution</th></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Media errors</td> 
<td vAlign=top>If you are installing from a CD-ROM, use a different CD-ROM. To request a replacement CD-ROM, contact Microsoft or your  vendor.
<p>If one of your Setup disks is not working, try using a different set of Setup disks. You can make a new set of Setup disks by running Makeboot.bat.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Nonsupported CD-ROM drive</td> 
<td vAlign=top>Replace the CD-ROM drive with one that is supported, or if that is not possible, try another method of installing, such as installing over the network, and then after you have completed the installation, you can add the adapter card driver for the CD-ROM drive if it is available.</td></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Insufficient disk space</td> 
<td vAlign=top>Use the Setup program to create a partition by using existing free space on the hard disk.
<p>Delete and create partitions as needed to create a partition that is large enough for installation.</p>
<p>Reformat an existing partition to create more space.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Failure of dependency service to start</td> 
<td vAlign=top>In the Windows 2000 Setup wizard, return to the Network Settings dialog box and verify that you installed the correct protocol and network adapter. Verify that the network adapter has the proper configuration settings, such as transceiver type, and that the local computer name is unique on the network.</td></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Inability to connect to the domain controller</td> 
<td vAlign=top>Verify that the domain name is correct. 
<p>Verify that the server running the DNS Service and the domain controller are both running and online. If you cannot locate a domain controller, install into a workgroup and then join the domain after installation.</p>
<p>Verify that the network adapter card and protocol settings are  set correctly.</p>
<p>If you are reinstalling Windows 2000 and using the same  computer name, delete and then recreate the computer account.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td vAlign=top>Failure of Windows 2000 to install or start</td> 
<td vAlign=top>Verify that is detecting all of the hardware and that Windows 2000 all of the hardware is on the HCL.</td></tr>

<A NAME="101"><H2>Setup Logs</H2></A>

<p>During Setup, Windows 2000 generates a number of log files. These
logs contain information about the installation process, which can help
you resolve any problems that occur after Setup completes. Two of the
logs are especially useful for troubleshooting: the action log and the
error log.</p>

<A NAME="102"><H3>Action Log</H3></A>

<p>The action log provides a description of the actions that Setup
performs. These actions are recorded in chronological order, and
include such actions as copying files and creating registry entries.
The action log also includes any entries that are written to the Setup
error log. The action log is stored in the file setupact.log.</p>

<A NAME="103"><H3>Error Log</H3></A>

<p>The error log contains a description of any errors that occur during
Setup, along with an indication of the severity of each error. If
errors occur, the error log is shown to the user by the log viewer at
the end of Setup. The error log is stored in setuperr.log.</p>

<A NAME="104"><H3>Additional Logs</H3></A>

<p>A number of additional logs are created during Setup. These include
the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>%windir%\comsetup.log</b> outlines installation for
Optional Component Manager and Com+ components.</li></p>

<p><li><b>%windir%\mmdet.log</b> is a detection log for multimedia
devices detailing port ranges for each device.</li></p>

<p><li><b>%windir%\setupapi.log</b> Each time a line from an INF
file is implemented an entry is made in this log. If, for some reason,
an error occurs it will log information here to indicate the failure.</li></p>

<p><li><b>%windir%\debug\NetSetup.log</b> logs joining domain or
workgroup activity</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="105"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You might encounter some common problems when installing Windows
2000. Installation problems could be caused by bad media, in which case
you will have to get a new CD-ROM to be able to install. You might also
encounter problems with your installation if your hardware is not on
the HCL. If your CD-ROM drive is not on the HCL, you can swap it out
for a supported drive or install over the network and add the driver to
support the CD-ROM drive if it is available.</p>

<p>If you failed to complete your preinstallation tasks and there is
not enough room on any of the partitions to install Windows 2000, you
can create a new partition from unused space on the hard disk, if the
space is available; you can delete some existing partitions so that you
can create one that is large enough to install Windows 2000; or you can
format an existing partition to provide enough space to install Windows
2000.</p>

<p>You also learned some tips to try in case you cannot connect to the
domain controller. If you cannot connect to the domain controller, you
can complete the installation by having the computer join a workgroup. After you have
completed the installation and determine what is preventing you from
connecting to the domain controller, you can have the computer join the domain.</p>

<A NAME="41"><H1>Lesson 3: Windows 2000 Server</H1></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server builds on the strengths of Windows NT Server 4.0
by providing a faster, more reliable platform that is easier to manage
and lowers your total cost of ownership (TCO) by integrating easily
with existing systems.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Server supports new systems that dramatically increase
system performance, and provides the following benefits: enhanced SMP
support, simplified management, enhanced file management and security,
improved networking and communications, and improved printing
support.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify features and enhancements in Windows 2000
Server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="42"><H2>Symmetric Multiprocessing</H2></A>

<p>Previous versions of Windows NT required an Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Hardware Access Layer (HAL) if more than two
processors were to be used on a computer. If you installed an OEM HAL
to increase the supported number of processors in a computer, and then
upgrade to Windows 2000, Windows 2000 provides the same level of support. Therefore, upgrading
from Windows NT 4.0 Server to Windows 2000 Server or from Windows NT
4.0 Enterprise Edition to Windows 2000 Advanced Server or Windows 2000
Datacenter Server exceeds SMP support in fresh installs. See Table
1.2.</p>

<p><b>Table 1.2</b> <i>The Windows 2000 Platform</i></p>
<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">
<tr>
<th>Operating System</th>
<th>Clean Installation</th>
<th>Upgrade</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Windows 2000 Datacenter Server</td>
<td valign="top">16 Processors</td>
<td valign="top">32 Processors</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>If you need to reinstall Windows 2000 on a computer and the number
of processors in the computer exceeds the number supported by a clean
installation of Windows 2000, you must install the OEM version of
Windows NT 4.<i>x</i> first, and then upgrade to Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="43"><H2>Simplified Management</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server helps administrators manage their networks more
easily from a central location, dramatically decreasing the TCO. It
offers several features and enhancements that provide the foundation
for simplifying management of your entire network.</p>

<p>Figure 1.2 lists the four main ways that Windows 2000 Server
simplifies management of your network.</p>

<A NAME="44"><H3>Active Directory Directory Services</H3></A>

<p>Directory services based on Active Directory technology are included
in Windows 2000 Server. They extend the features of previous
Windows-based directory services and are designed to work well in any size
installation, from a single server with hundreds of objects to thousands of servers with
millions of objects.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services provide a single, consistent,
open set of interfaces for performing common administrative tasks, such
as adding new users or managing printers. Active Directory directory
services also make it easier for users to locate and access resources anywhere on the network.</p>

<A NAME="45"><H3>Management Capabilities</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server contains all of the same configuration
management capabilities as Windows 2000 Professional. Additional
configuration management capabilities in Windows 2000 Server include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Microsoft Management Console (MMC).</b> Provides a common
console for monitoring network functions and accessing administrative
tools. The MMC is customizable, allowing administrators to create
consoles that include only the administrative tools that they
need.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Group Policy.</b> Gives administrators more control over
which users have access to specific workstations, data, and applications, allowing
administrators to define and control the state of computers and users
in an organization.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Scripting Host.</b> Allows administrators and
users to save time by automating many actions, such as connecting to or
disconnecting from a network server, creating multiple user accounts, or creating a
large number of groups. Scripts can be run directly on the desktop or from the
command prompt.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="46"><H3>Network and System Management Features</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server contains several tools that help you easily and
more cost effectively install, configure, and administer your Windows
2000 network. Network and system management features in Windows 2000
Server include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Remote Installation Services (RIS).</b> Allows
administrators to install Windows 2000 Professional on client computers throughout a
network from a central location. RIS can dramatically decrease the cost of
deploying new operating systems by reducing the amount of time an
administrator spends moving from one client location to another.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).</b> Improves
administrative control by allowing administrators to correlate data and
events from multiple sources and vendors on a local or enterprise
basis.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Dynamic Updates in DNS or DNS UPDATE.</b> Reduces network
administration costs by reducing the need for manual editing and
replication of the Domain Name System (DNS) database each time that a change occurs in
a DNS client's configuration.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For more information on dynamic updates in DNS
or DNS UPDATE, see RFC 2136. An RFC (<i>Request for Comment</i>) is a
document in which a standard, a protocol, or other information
pertaining to the operation of the Internet is published. The RFC is
actually issued <i>after</i> discussion and serves as the standard. You
can find the text of each RFC that is cited in this book (as well as much associated discussion material) 
on the Internet. Use your Web browser and search, using any of the popular search engines on
the Internet, to find the RFC of interest. In this case, search for
&quot;RFC 2136.&quot;
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Remote Storage.</b> Monitors the amount of available
space on a local hard disk. When the free space on the primary hard
disk drops below the necessary level, Remote Storage automatically
removes local data that has been copied to remote storage, providing
the required free disk space.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="47"><H3>Application Services</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server is the first platform to provide an integrated
set of services for building and deploying scalable, reliable
applications. Application services in Windows 2000 Server include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Indexing Service.</b> Automatically builds an index of
your Web server that can be easily searched from any Web browser.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Terminal Services.</b> Allows clients to access
Windows-based applications running entirely on the server and supports multiple client
sessions on the server. The server manages all computing resources for
each client that is connected to the server and provides all users who are logged on
with their own environment. Users can log on to multiple-terminal
servers or a single-terminal server multiple times.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="48"><H2>Enhanced File Management and Security</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server file management features improve resource
availability and make it easier to manage your network storage
requirements. Security features in Windows 2000 Server provide the
highest levels of data protection and simplify administrative
tasks.</p>

<A NAME="49"><H3>File Management Enhancements</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server provides significant enhancements to file
management capabilities, enabling you to implement a more secure and manageable
network. Enhancements to file management in Windows 2000 Server include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Distributed file system (Dfs).</b> Simplifies the process
of creating a single directory tree that includes multiple file servers and file shares
in a group, division, or enterprise. This structure makes it easier for users
to find and manage data on a network.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk quotas.</b> Provides more precise control of
network-based storage. You can use disk quotas to monitor and limit
disk space use, increasing bandwidth efficiency.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="50"><H3>Security Features</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server contains all of the same security features as
Windows 2000 Professional, plus the following features:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Active Directory directory services security.</b> Allows
administrators to create group accounts to more efficiently manage
system security by allowing access to objects in Active Directory
directory services based on group membership.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Security Templates.</b> Organizes all existing security
attributes into one place, making it easier to administer security on a
local computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Security Configuration and Analysis.</b> Allows you to
import one or more saved configurations to a security database.
Importing configurations builds a computer-specific security database
that stores a composite configuration.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="51"><H2>Improved Networking and Communications</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server includes technologies that provide greater
bandwidth control, secure network access from offsite locations, and
support a new generation of communications solutions. Networking and
communications features in Windows 2000 Server include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>MultiProtocol Routing.</b> Enables routing over multiple
protocols, such as IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), and
AppleTalk on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN).
It also provides support for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and
Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIP 2).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) support.</b> Allows a
network to simultaneously transport a wide variety of network traffic,
including voice, data, images, and video.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS).</b>
Provides authentication and accounting services for distributed dial-up
networking. Windows 2000 can act as a RADIUS client, a RADIUS server,
or both.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="52"><H2>Improved Printing Support</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server makes printing easier and more flexible than
ever before. Active Directory directory services integration with
Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server make all shared printers in your
domain available as objects in Active Directory directory services.</p>

<p>Publishing printers in Active Directory directory services allows
users to quickly locate the most convenient printing resources through
an improved user interface. Locating printers in a timely manner can
dramatically improve productivity, particularly for users who travel or
change offices frequently.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Server contains all of the same printing support
features as Windows 2000 Professional and also provides support for
more than 2,500 different printers. This makes it easier for
organizations to use the printing services in Windows 2000 Server with
existing printers, new printers, and shared printer pools.</p>

<A NAME="53"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<A NAME="62"><H1>Lesson 1: Preparing to Install</H1></A>

<p>When you install Windows 2000, the Windows 2000 Setup program asks
you to provide information about how you want to install and configure
the operating system. Good preparation helps you avoid problems during
and after the installation.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Prepare to install the beta version of Microsoft Windows
2000 by completing preinstallation tasks such as identifying the
hardware requirements and the required installation information.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="63"><H2>Preinstallation Tasks</H2></A>

<p>Before you start the installation, complete the following
preinstallation tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the hardware requirements to install Windows 2000,
and make sure that your hardware meets these requirements.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine whether your hardware is on the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL).</li></p>

<p><li>Determine how you want to partition the hard disk on which
you are going to install Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Choose a file system for the installation partition.</li></p>

<p><li>Choose a licensing mode for a server that will be running
Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify whether your computer will join a domain or a
workgroup.</li></p>

<p><li>Complete a checklist of preinstallation tasks to help ensure
a successful installation.</li></p>

<p><li>Run the Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Verification
tool.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="64"><H2>Hardware Requirements</H2></A>

<p>You must know the minimum hardware requirements for installing and
operating Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows
2000 Advanced Server to determine if your hardware meets these
requirements (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.1). Make sure that your hardware meets or
exceeds these requirements.</p>

<A NAME="65"><H2>Hardware Compatibility List</H2></A>

<p>Before you install Windows 2000, verify that your hardware is on the
Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Microsoft provides
tested drivers for only those devices that are included on this list.
Using hardware that is not listed on the HCL could cause problems
during and after installation.</p>

<p>For a copy of the HCL, see the Hcl.txt file in the Support folder on
the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.</p>

<p>You will also find the most recent versions of the HCL for released
operating systems on the Internet at the Microsoft Web site
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com</a>).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Microsoft supports only those devices that are
listed on the HCL. If you have hardware that is not on this list,
contact the hardware manufacturer to determine if there is a
manufacturer-supported Windows 2000 driver for the
component.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Microsoft provides the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for Windows
2000 products because Windows 2000 requires greater control of the
hardware, compared to other operating systems such as MS-DOS and
Windows, for security, stability, and efficiency reasons. This in turn
implies a deeper knowledge and utilization on the part of the operating system of the computer hardware. Small incompatibilities and differences from industry
standards of that hardware can have an adverse effect on the stability
of the Windows 2000 operating system.</p>

<A NAME="66"><H2>Disk Partitions</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Setup program examines the hard disk to determine
its existing configuration. Setup then allows you to install Windows
2000 on an existing partition or create a new partition on which to
install Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="67"><H3>New Partition or Existing Partition</H3></A>

<p>Depending on the state of the hard disk, you can choose one of the
following options during the installation:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you must create and size
the Windows 2000 partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has partitions and has enough unpartitioned
disk space, you can create the Windows 2000 partition by using the
unpartitioned space.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large
enough, you can install Windows 2000 on that partition. Installing on
an existing partition will overwrite any existing data.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete
it to create more unpartitioned disk space to use to create the Windows
2000 partition.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="68"><H3>Remaining Free Hard Disk Space</H3></A>

<p>Although you can use Setup to create other partitions, you should
create and size only the partition on which you will install Windows
2000. After you install Windows 2000, use the Computer Management
administrative tool to partition any remaining unpartitioned space on
the hard disk.</p>

<A NAME="69"><H3>Size of the Installation Partition</H3></A>

<p>Microsoft recommends that you install Windows 2000 on a 1 GB or
larger partition. Although Windows 2000 requires a minimum of about 685
MB of disk space for installation, using a larger installation
partition provides flexibility in the future. Then, if required, you
can install updates to Windows 2000, operating system tools, or other
files that are required by Windows 2000.</p>

<p>When you determine the disk space required for installing Windows
2000 on a computer, you must decide whether you are doing a clean
installation or an upgrade, and whether you will be installing from
CD-ROM or over the network. You must also know the cluster size being
used.</p>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing from CD-ROM, Setup
creates the temporary folder $Win_nt$.~bt. If you are doing an upgrade
and installing over the network, Setup creates the temporary folders
$Win_nt$.~bt and $Win_nt$.~ls. The $Win_nt$.~ls folder contains the
actual Windows 2000 files to be installed. There must be enough
available space to allow for these folders.</p>

<p>To determine the space requirements for these folders, open the
Txtsetup.sif file located in the I386 folder of your source files. The
last section in this file is [DiskSpaceRequirements] and contains the
values used by Setup. Notice that the sizes of these folders vary
depending on the cluster size. The cluster sizes listed in the
Txtsetup.sif file are 512, 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, and
256K. Once you select the appropriate cluster size, the first number
listed represents the space required for the $Win_nt$.~ls folder, and
the second number listed represents the space required for the
$Win_nt$.~bt folder.</p>

<A NAME="70"><H3>Upgrade Installation from CD-ROM</H3></A>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing from CD-ROM, Winnt32
checks the space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder on the system partition.
It then checks to find the location of the %windir% and the operating
system of the installation in use. Winnt32 checks the partition
containing the %windir% directory to see if there is enough space for
the computed sum of the $Win_nt$.~bt folder size and upgrade growth
size. Setup subtracts the cache size (temporary Internet files, etc.)
to be deleted from the required disk space. If there is enough room,
Setup proceeds. Otherwise, it generates a warning.</p>

<A NAME="71"><H3>Upgrade Installation over the Network</H3></A>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing over the network, Winnt32
checks the space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder on the system partition.
It then checks to find the location of the %windir% and the operating
system of the installation in use. After determining the operating
system, Winnt32 checks the partition containing the %windir% to see if
there is enough space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder size and upgrade
growth size.</p>

<p>Winnt32 then checks any drive on the system for the space required
for the compressed $Win_nt$.~ls folder. If the $Win_nt$.~ls folder is
in the same partition where the operating system is to be installed,
the files to be moved during Text Mode are accounted for in the disk
space calculation.</p>

<A NAME="72"><H2>File Systems</H2></A>

<p>After you create the installation partition, Setup prompts you to
select the file system with which to format the partition. As with Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000 supports NT file system (NTFS) and file allocation table
(FAT). New to Windows 2000 is support for FAT32. Figure 2.2 summarizes
some of the features of these files systems.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f02up02x.htm')"> <img src="images/f02up02.JPG" width=404 height=348 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.2</b> <i>Summary of file systems features</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="73"><H3>NTFS</H3></A>

<p>Use NTFS when the partition on which Windows 2000 will reside
requires any of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>File- and folder-level security.</b> NTFS allows you to
control access to files and folders.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk compression.</b> NTFS compresses files to store more
data on the partition.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk quotas.</b> NTFS allows you to control disk usage on
a per-user basis. For additional information, see <a href="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</a>,
&quot;Managing File Resources.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Encryption.</b> NTFS allows you to encrypt file data on
the physical hard disk.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The new version of NTFS in Windows 2000 supports remote storage,
dynamic volumes, and the mounting of volumes to folders. Windows 2000
and Windows NT are the only operating systems that can access data on a
local hard disk that is formatted with NTFS.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
If you plan to promote a server to a domain
controller, format the installation partition with NTFS. 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If you do not format the installation partition as NTFS
during installation, the Convert command allows you to convert the FAT
or FAT32 partition to an NTFS partition with no loss of data. For
example, if you want to convert the C: drive to NTFS, use the following
command: <b>convert c: /fs:ntfs /v</b> at the command prompt. For more
information on the Convert command, start a command prompt and type <b>
convert /?</b> on the command line.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="74"><H3>FAT and FAT32</H3></A>

<p>FAT and FAT32 allow access by, and compatibility with, other
operating systems. To dual boot Windows 2000 and another operating
system, format the system partition with either FAT or FAT32.</p>

<p>Setup determines whether to format the hard disk with FAT or FAT32
based on the size of the installation partition.</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Partition size</th> <th valign="top">Format</th></tr>
<tr><td vAlign=top>Smaller than 2 GB</td> <td vAlign=top>Setup formats the partition as FAT</td></tr>
<tr><td vAlign=top>Larger than 2 GB</td> <td vAlign=top>Setup formats the partition as FAT32</td></tr>
</table>

<p>FAT and FAT32 do not offer many of the features that are supported
by NTFS (for example, file-level security). Therefore, in most
situations, you should format the hard disk with NTFS. The only reason
to use FAT or FAT32 is for dual booting. If you are setting up a
computer for dual booting, you would only have to format the system
partition as FAT or FAT32. For example, if drive C is the system
partition, you could format drive C as FAT or FAT32 and format drive D
as NTFS. However, Microsoft does not recommend dual booting a
server.</p>

<A NAME="75"><H2>Licensing</H2></A>

<p>In addition to the license that is required to install and run
Windows 2000 Server and the license that is required to install and run
an operating system on each client computer, you also need to license each client connection to the server.</p>

<A NAME="76"><H3>Client Access License</H3></A>

<p>A Client Access License (CAL) gives client computers the right to
connect to computers running one of the Windows 2000 Server family of
products so that the client computers can connect to network services,
shared folders, and print resources. When you install one of the family
of Windows 2000 Server products, you will discover that the licensing
modes in Windows 2000 are the same as in Windows NT 4.0: you can select
the Per Seat or Per Server licensing mode.</p>

<p>The following services do not require Client Access Licenses:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Anonymous or authenticated access to any of the Windows 2000
Server products with Microsoft Internet Information Services 4.0 (IIS)
or a Web-server application that provides Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) sharing of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files.</li></p>

<p><li>Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connections.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If your company uses Microsoft BackOffice
products, you must also have licenses for the BackOffice products. A
Windows 2000 license does not cover BackOffice products.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="77"><H3>Per Seat Licensing</H3></A>

<p>The Per Seat licensing mode requires a separate CAL for each client
computer that is used to access a computer running one of the Windows
2000 Server products for basic network services. After a client
computer has a CAL, it can be used to access any computer running a
Windows 2000 Server product on the enterprise network. Per Seat
licensing is often more economical for large networks where client
computers will be used to connect to more than one server.</p>

<A NAME="78"><H3>Per Server Licensing</H3></A>

<p>With Per Server licensing, CALs are assigned to a particular server.
Each CAL allows one connection per client computer to the server for
basic network services. You must have at least as many CALs that are
dedicated to the server as the maximum number of client computers that
will be used to concurrently connect to that server at any time.</p>

<p>Per Server licensing is preferred by small companies with only one
computer running Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server.
It is also useful for Internet or remote-access servers where client
computers might not be licensed as Windows 2000 network client
computers. In this situation, Per Server licensing allows you to
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon attempts.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
If you are unsure which licensing mode to use, choose Per Server because you can change, only once, from Per Server to Per Seat licensing at no additional cost (by double-clicking the Licensing icon in Control Panel). It is not necessary to notify Microsoft to make this change. This is a one-way conversion; you cannot convert from Per Seat to Per Server.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="79"><H2>Domain or Workgroup Membership</H2></A>

<p>During installation, you must choose the type of network security
group that you want the computer to join: a domain or a workgroup (see
Figure 2.3).</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f02up03x.htm')"> <img src="images/f02up03.JPG" width=404 height=275 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.3</b> <i>Domain or workgroup membership</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="80"><H3>Joining a Domain</H3></A>

<p>During installation, you can add the computer on which you are
installing Windows 2000 to an existing domain. Adding a computer to a
domain is referred to as <i>joining a domain</i>. If you are installing
Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server, the computer is
added as a member server. A computer running Windows 2000 Server or
Windows 2000 Advanced Server that is a member of a domain, and is not a
domain controller, is called a <i>member server</i>.</p>

<p>Joining a domain during installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>A domain name.</b> Ask the domain administrator for the
Domain Name System (DNS) name for the domain that you want to join. An
example of a DNS-compatible domain name is <i>microsoft.com,</i> where
<i>microsoft</i> is the name of your organization's
DNS-identity.</li></p>

<p><li><b>A computer account.</b> Before a computer can join a
domain, you must create a computer account in the domain. You can ask a
domain administrator to create the computer account before
installation, or, if you have administrative privileges for the domain,
you can create the computer account during installation. If you create
the computer account during installation, Setup prompts you for a name
and password of a user account with authority to add domain computer
accounts.</li></p>

<p><li><b>An available domain controller and a server running the
DNS Service (called the <i>DNS server</i>).</b> At least one domain
controller in the domain that you are joining and one DNS server must
be online when you install a computer in the domain.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can join a domain during installation or
after installation.</blockquote></div>
</p> 

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
The exercises in this book will use the domain named
<i>domain.com</i>. It is a special domain name reserved internationally for the use of
authors and others in writing books like this one, so that no real company's
domain name is used inadvertently. If you wish, you may also perform
the practices in this book using <i>domain.com</i>. Otherwise,
substitute your chosen domain name whenever you see <i>domain.com</i>
in the text.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="81"><H3>Joining a Workgroup</H3></A>

<p>As with Windows NT 4.0, you will only join a workgroup if you are in
a small network without a domain or in preparation for joining a domain
later on.</p>

<p>During installation, you can add the computer on which you are
installing Windows 2000 to an existing workgroup. Adding a computer to
a workgroup is referred to as <i>joining a workgroup</i>. If you are
installing Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server, the
computer is added as a stand-alone server. A computer running Windows
2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server that is not a member of a
domain is called a <i>stand-alone server</i>.</p>

<p>If you join a workgroup as a stand-alone server during installation,
you must assign a workgroup name to your computer. The workgroup name
that you assign can be the name of an existing workgroup or the name of
a new workgroup that you create during installation.</p>

<A NAME="82"><H2>Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Verification Tool</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Verification tool examines
your hardware and software for known problems that might be encountered
after upgrading to Windows 2000. It creates a report to determine the
hardware files and any upgrade packs needed to successfully run Windows
2000.</p>

<p>If files are needed, the administrator should go to the hardware or
software manufacturer's Web sites for updates or check the
Microsoft Internet site at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com</a>.</p>

<p>You run the Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Verification tool by
using one of the two methods that follow.</p>

<p>Winnt32.exe /checkupgradeonly</p>

<p>Chkupgrd.bat</p>

<p>For Windows 9x upgrades, Setup creates a report named Upgrade.txt in
the Windows installation folder. For Windows NT 4.0 upgrades, it saves the
report to the Winnt32.log in the installation folder.</p>

<p>Depending on the problems that are discovered, the areas in the
report could include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>DOS Configuration</b>. This section includes any entries
in Autoexec.bat and Config.sys that are incompatible with Windows 2000.
These entries may be associated with older hardware or software that is
incompatible with Windows 2000. Additional technical information is
provided in the Setupact.log file, located in the Windows folder. The
Setupact.log is discussed in a later lesson.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Messaging Services</b>. This section lists any
messaging (MAPI) programs that Setup detected that do not function in
Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Plug-and-Play Hardware</b>. This section lists any

<A NAME="84"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>This lesson identified all the preinstallation tasks you must
understand and complete before you install Windows 2000. The first task
is to identify the hardware requirements for installing Windows 2000
and to ensure that your hardware meets these requirements. It is
important that your hardware be on the Windows 2000 Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL), so that it is compatible with Windows 2000.
After you have determined that your hardware is on the HCL, you must
determine how you want to partition the hard disk on which you are
going to install Windows 2000. You must also determine whether you are
going to format the partition as NTFS, so that you can have better
security and a richer feature set, or as FAT or FAT32, so that other
operating systems can access the data on the installation
partition.</p>

<p>A Client Access License (CAL) gives client computers the right to
connect to computers running Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000
Advanced Server. With Per Seat licensing mode a separate CAL is
required for each client computer that accesses a Windows 2000
computer. When a client computer has a CAL, it can be used to access
any computer running Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced
Server on the enterprise network. With Per Server licensing, CALs are assigned to a particular server. Each CAL allows
one connection per client computer to the server, and you must have at
least as many CALs that are dedicated to the server as the maximum
number of client computers that will be used to concurrently connect to
that server at any time.</p>

<p>During installation, your computer must join a domain or a
workgroup. If your computer is the first one installed on the network,
or if for some other reason there is no domain available for your
computer to join, you can have the computer join a workgroup and then
have the computer join a domain after the installation. This lesson also provided a checklist of preinstallation
tasks that you can complete to help ensure a successful installation of Windows
2000.</p>

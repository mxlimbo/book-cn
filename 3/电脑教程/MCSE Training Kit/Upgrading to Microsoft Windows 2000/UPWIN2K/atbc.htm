<A NAME="9"><H1>Getting Started</H1></A>

<p>This self-paced training course contains hands-on practices to help
you learn about Windows 2000. Some practices and some exercises within
practices are marked as optional. To complete these optional exercises,
you must have two networked computers or be connected to a larger
network. Both computers must be capable of running Windows 2000. If you
have only one machine, read through the steps and familiarize yourself
with the procedure as best you can.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr>
Several exercises may require you to make
changes to your server. This may have undesirable results if you are
connected to a larger network. Check with your network administrator
before attempting these exercises.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="10"><H3>Hardware Requirements</H3></A>

<p>Each computer must have the following minimum configuration. All
hardware should be on the Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List
(HCL). You'll find this list in the HCL.TXT file in the \Support
directory of the Windows 2000 installation CD-ROM.</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Pentium 166 MHz or Compaq Alpha-based processor</li></p>

<p><li>The computer must be connected to a network hub; it is not
necessary for any additional computers to be connected to the hub.</li></p>

<p><li>64 MB of RAM</li></p>

<p><li>2 GB hard disk with 685 MB (1 GB recommended) of free space
to install Windows 2000 Server and create partitions</li></p>

<p><li>12x CD-ROM drive</li></p>

<p><li>SVGA monitor capable of 800x600 resolution
(1024x768 is recommended)</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="11"><H3>Software Requirements</H3></A>

<p>The following software is required to complete the procedures in
this course.</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Windows 2000 Server.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Readers working with prerelease versions of
Windows 2000 may find some minor discrepancies in such items as menu
names and dialog boxes or in certain procedures. The practices in this
book were written based on Release Candidate 2 of the operating system.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="12"><H3>Setup Instructions</H3></A>

<p>Set up your computer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.</p>

<p>For the exercises that require networked computers, you need to make
sure the computers can communicate with each other. The first computer
will be designated as a domain controller, and will be assigned the
computer account name Server1 in the domain, domain.com. The second
computer will act as a stand-alone server for most of the optional
practices in this course.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr>
If your computers are part of a larger
network, you <i>must</i> verify with your network administrator that
the computer names, domain name, and other information used in setting
up Windows 2000 as described in <a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a> do not conflict with network
operations. If they do conflict, ask your network administrator to
provide alternative values and use those values in all of the exercises
in this book.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The installation of Windows 2000 is part of this kit and is covered
in <a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a>. If you are installing two computers, follow the same
instructions on both computers.</p>

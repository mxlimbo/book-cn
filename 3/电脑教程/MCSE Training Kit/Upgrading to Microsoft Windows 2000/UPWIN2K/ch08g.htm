<A NAME="423"><H1>Lesson 6: Using Disk Defragmenter</H1></A>

<p>Windows 2000 saves files and folders in the first available space on
a hard disk and not necessarily in an area of contiguous space. This
leads to file and folder fragmentation. When your hard disk contains a
lot of fragmented files and folders, your computer takes longer to gain
access to them because it requires several additional reads to collect
the various pieces. Creating new files and folders also takes longer
because the available free space on the hard disk is scattered. Your
computer must save a new file or folder in various locations on the
hard disk. This lesson introduces the Windows 2000 system tool, Disk
Defragmenter, which helps organize your hard disks.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe defragmentation.</li></p>

<p><li>Use Disk Defragmenter to organize your hard disks.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="424"><H2>Defragmenting Disks</H2></A>

<p>The process of finding and consolidating fragmented files and
folders is called <i>defragmenting</i>. Disk Defragmenter locates
fragmented files and folders and defragments them. Disk Defragmenter
moves the pieces of each file or folder to one location so that each
file or folder occupies a single, contiguous space on the hard disk.
Consequently, your system can gain access to and save files and folders
more efficiently. By consolidating files and folders, Disk Defragmenter
also consolidates free space, making it less likely that new files will
be fragmented. Disk Defragmenter can defragment FAT, FAT32, and NTFS
volumes.</p>

<p>To open the Disk Defragmenter, from the Administrator's Tools
menu, open Computer Management, and then click Disk Defragmenter. This
opens Disk Deframenter in the Computer Management window. For an
alternative, you can also select Disk Defragmenter from the System
Tools menu, which you access from the Programs menu. This opens Disk
Defragmenter in its own window, which is split into three areas, as
shown in Figure 8.7.</p>

<p>The upper portion lists the volumes that you can analyze and
defragment. The middle portion provides a graphic representation of how
fragmented the selected volume is. The lower portion provides a graphic
representation of the volume during and after defragmentation. The
display colors indicate the condition of the volume as follows:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Red indicates fragmented files.</li></p>

<p><li>Dark blue indicates contiguous (nonfragmented) files.</li></p>

<p><li>Green indicates system files, which Disk Defragmenter cannot
move.</li></p>

<p><li>White indicates free space on the volume.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>By comparing the Analysis Display band to the Defragmentation
Display band, you can quickly see the improvement in the volume after
defragmentation.</p>

<p>If you want to analyze and defragment a volume, in Disk
Defragmenter, select one of the options that are described in Table
8.9.</p>

<A NAME="425"><H2>Using Disk Defragmenter Effectively</H2></A>

<p>The following list provides best practices for using Disk
Defragmenter:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Run Disk Defragmenter when the computer will receive the
least usage. During defragmentation, data is moved around on the hard disk and
the defragmentation process is microprocessor intensive. The
defragmentation process will adversely affect access time to other
disk-based resources.</li></p>

<p><li>Educate users to defragment their local hard disks at least
once a month to prevent accumulation of fragmented files.</li></p>

<p><li>Analyze the target volume before you install large
applications, and then defragment the volume if necessary.
Installations complete more quickly when the target media has adequate
contiguous free space. Additionally, gaining access to the application, after it is installed, is
faster.</li></p>

<p><li>NTFS compression can cause performance degradation when you
copy and move files. When a compressed file is copied, it is
uncompressed, copied, and then compressed again as a new file. Compress
static data rather than data that changes frequently or is copied or
moved frequently.</li></p>

<p><li>Before you can delete a quota entry for a user account, all
files that the user owns must be removed from the volume or another
user must take ownership of the files.</li></p>

<p><li>When you delete a large number of files or folders, your
hard disk can become excessively fragmented, so be sure that you analyze it
afterward. Generally, you should defragment hard disks on busy file
servers more often than those on single-user client computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="426"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 saves files and folders in the first available space on
a hard disk and not necessarily in an area of contiguous space. This
leads to file and folder fragmentation. When your hard disk contains a

access to these files and folders and to create new files and
folders.</p>

<p>The Windows 2000 system tool, Disk Defragmenter, locates fragmented
files and folders and defragments them. Consequently, your system can
gain access to and save files and folders more efficiently. By
consolidating files and folders, Disk Defragmenter also consolidates

Disk Defragmenter can defragment FAT, FAT32, and NTFS volumes.</p>

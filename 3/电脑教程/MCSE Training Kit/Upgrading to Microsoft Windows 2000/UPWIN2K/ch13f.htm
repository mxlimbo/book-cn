to Windows 2000? If so, what is the upgrade path?   </li></p>

<p><li>You have a laptop running Windows 95 and you want to upgrade it
to Windows 2000. The computer has 16 MB of RAM, and this can be
upgraded to 24 MB. Can you upgrade this computer to Windows 2000? If
not, how would you make it so this computer is able to access Active
Directory directory services?   </li></p>

<p><li>You are about to install Active Directory directory services in
your network, and you want to use your existing DNS servers to support
Active Directory directory services. What two features must be
supported by the DNS server?   </li></p>

<p><li>Your organization currently uses a Windows NT 4.0 single master
domain model. Your organization has decided to upgrade to Windows 2000
and Active Directory directory services. How will you establish the
root domain for your organization and what system recovery step should
you take?   </li></p>

<p><li>Your organization wants to migrate to Active Directory directory
services from a multiple master domain model. They created a new empty
root domain and now wish to upgrade their existing Windows NT 4.0
domains. Explain the steps you must use to upgrade the master domains, and then the
resource domains.</li></p>

<p><li>Your organization has a Windows NT 4.0 member server in a domain
that has been upgraded to Active Directory directory services. The
member server is a print server and you have created local groups on
that server and applied permissions to those groups. You also put
global groups from the domain into the local groups to give print
permissions. What happens to the local groups when you upgrade to
Windows 2000?   </li></p>

<p><li>You are about to upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 workstation to Windows

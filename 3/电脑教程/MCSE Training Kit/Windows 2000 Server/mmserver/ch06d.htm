<A NAME="255"><h1>Lesson 3: Implementing Active Directory Services</h1></A>
<p>This lesson covers information about installing Active Directory services onto a Windows 2000 Server computer. This includes a review of the Active Directory Installation wizard. In addition, the lesson discusses the database and shared system volume created during the installation of Active Directory services. Finally, the lesson describes the Ntds.dit file and domain modes.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Install Active Directory services on a Windows 2000 Server computer</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="256"><h2>The Active Directory Installation Wizard</h2></A>
<p>The Active Directory Installation wizard is used to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Adding a domain controller to an existing domain</li></p>

<p><li>Creating the first domain controller of a new domain</li></p>

<p><li>Creating a new child domain</li></p>

<p><li>Creating a new domain tree</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To launch the Active Directory Installation wizard, run Configure Your Server, which is located on the Administrative Tools menu of the Start menu, and then select the Active Directory link. From there you can run the Active Directory Installation wizard. You can also start the wizard by running the dcpromo.exe utility from the Run window or from a command prompt. Either of these procedures will run the Active Directory Installation wizard on a stand-alone server and step you through the process of installing Active Directory services on the computer and creating a new domain controller.</p>

<p>As you install Active Directory services, you can choose either to add the new domain controller to an existing domain or create the first domain controller for a new domain (Figure 6.5).</p>

</p>

<A NAME="257"><h3>Adding a Domain Controller to an Existing Domain</h3></A>
<p>If you choose to add a domain controller to an existing domain, you create a peer domain controller. Peer domain controllers are created for redundancy and to reduce the load on the existing domain controllers.</p>

<A NAME="258"><h3>Creating the First Domain Controller for a New Domain</h3></A>
<p>If you choose to create the first domain controller for a new domain, not only will you be creating a new domain controller, but also a new domain. Domains should be created to partition information, which enables you to scale Active Directory services to meet the needs of very large organizations.</p>

<p>When you create a new domain, you can select whether to create a new child domain or a new domain tree. When you create a child domain, the new domain is added as a child domain in an existing domain. When you create a new domain tree, the new domain is not part of an existing domain. At this point, you can create a new forest of domain trees or join an existing forest.</p>

</p>

<p>
<div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr>
Running dcpromo.exe on a domain controller allows you to remove Active Directory services from the domain controller and demote it to a stand-alone server. If you remove Active Directory services from all domain controllers in a domain, you also delete the directory database for the domain, and the domain no longer exists.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="259"><h2>The Database and Shared System Volume</h2></A>
<p>When you install Active Directory services, the database, the database log files, and the shared system volume are automatically created.</p>

<A NAME="260"><h3>The Active Directory Database</h3></A>
<p>The database is the directory for the new domain. The default location for the database and database log files is %systemroot%\Ntds. However, you can specify a different location during the Active Directory installation. For best performance, place the database and the log file on separate hard disks. Consider placing the database on a hardware-level redundant array of independent disks (RAID) implementation such as RAID-5 or RAID-10 (mirrored and striped disks) for fault tolerance and performance.</p>

<p>The directory database is actually stored in a file named Ntds.dit. The Ntds.dit file contains all of the information stored in the Active Directory store. It is an ESE database that contains the entire schema, the global catalog, and all the objects stored on that domain controller. During the promotion process, Ntds.dit is copied from the %systemroot%\System32 directory into the designated directory. Active Directory services is then started from the new copy of the file, and if there are other domain controllers present, the replication process updates this file from other domain controllers.</p>

<A NAME="261"><h3>The Shared System Volume</h3></A>
<p>The shared system volume is a folder structure that exists on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and some of the group policy objects for the current domain as well as the enterprise. The default location for the shared system volume is %systemroot%<i>\</i>Sysvol. The shared system volume must be located on a partition or volume formatted with NTFS 5.0.</p>

<p>Replication of the shared system volume occurs on the same schedule as Active Directory replication. As a result, you may not notice file replication to or from the newly created system volume until two replication periods have elapsed (typically, 10 minutes). This is because the first file replication period updates the configuration of other system volumes so that they are aware of the newly created system volume.</p>

<A NAME="262"><h2>Domain Modes</h2></A>
<p>There are two domain modes: Mixed mode and Native mode.</p>

<A NAME="263"><h3>Mixed Mode</h3></A>
<p>When you first install or upgrade a domain controller to Windows 2000 Server, the domain controller runs in Mixed mode. Mixed mode allows the domain controller to interact with any domain controllers in the domain that are running Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 (down-level domain controllers). In addition, any clients using NTLM and the directory service in Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0 need Mixed mode to authenticate to the network. They also need WINS for name resolution. These down-level clients will usually authenticate to the Windows 2000 Server computers before a down-level Windows NT Server computer answers their logon request. Also, a Windows 2000 Server computer always wins an election to become the master browser. This combined behavior places additional stress on the Windows 2000 Server domain controllers.</p>

<A NAME="264"><h3>Native Mode</h3></A>
<p>When all the domain controllers in the domain run Windows 2000 Server, and you do not plan to add any more down-level domain controllers to the domain, you can switch the domain from Mixed mode to Native mode.</p>

<p>Several things happen during the conversion from Mixed mode to Native mode:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Support for down-level replication ceases. Since down-level replication is gone, you can no longer have any domain controllers in your domain that are not running Windows 2000 Server.</li></p>

<p><li>You can no longer add new down-level domain controllers to the domain.</li></p>

<p><li>The server that served as the primary domain controller during migration is no longer the domain master; all domain controllers begin acting as peers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The change from Mixed mode to Native mode is one way only; you cannot change from Native mode to Mixed mode.

<A NAME="265"><h3>Exercise 1: Installing Active Directory services</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, you will make your stand-alone server, Server01 into the first domain controller in an Active Directory tree. The installation will install and configure DNS to support name resolution. In a later chapter, you will learn more about DNS and other network services, such as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Complete all procedures in this exercise on Server01.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Promoting a stand-alone server to a domain controller</b></li></p>

<p>In this exercise, you run dcpromo.exe to install Active Directory services and DNS on your stand-alone server (Server01), making it a domain controller and a DNS server in a new domain.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Start Server01 and log on as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>If the Windows 2000 Configure Server page opens, close it because the dcpromo.exe program will be used instead to accomplish the tasks in this procedure.</li></p>

<p><li>Insert the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM in Server01.</li></p>

<p>The installation CD-ROM is required to install the DNS service during the operation of dcpromo.exe.</p>

<p><li>If the Windows 2000 CD wizard appears, click Exit to close the screen.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start and then click Run.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Run dialog box, type <b>dcpromo.exe</b> and click OK.</li></p>

<p>The Active Directory Installation wizard appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Domain Controller Type screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Select Domain Controller For A New Domain, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Create Tree Or Child Domain screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Create A New Domain Tree radio button is selected, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Create Or Join Forest screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Select the Create A New Forest Of Domain Trees radio button, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The New Domain Name screen appears.</p>

<p><li>In the Full DNS Name For The New Domain box, type <b>microsoft.com</b>, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>After a few moments, the NetBIOS Domain Name screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Verify that MICROSOFT appears in the Domain NetBIOS Name text box, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Database And Log Locations screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Verify that C:\Winnt\Ntds is the location of both the database and the log, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Shared System Volume screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Read the information on the Shared System Volume screen, and then verify that the SYSVOL location is C:\WINNT\SYSVOL.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>An Active Directory Installation Wizard message box appears, stating that a DNS for microsoft.com could not be found.</p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>Dcpromo did not find an available DNS for microsoft.com, so the Configure DNS screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Yes, Install And Configure DNS On The Computer (Recommended) radio button is selected, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Permissions screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Initially, the domain controller will be run in Mixed mode, so verify that the Permissions Compatible With Pre-Windows 2000 Servers radio button is selected, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Directory Services Restore Mode Administrator Password screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Read this screen, then type <b>password</b> in both text boxes, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Summary screen appears, listing the options you selected.</p>

<p><li>Review the contents of the Summary screen, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Configuring Active Directory progress indicator appears as Active Directory services is installed on the server.</p>

<p>This process will take several minutes. While you are waiting, verify that you have inserted the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM into Server01 in preparation for the DNS service installation.</p>

<p><li>When the Completing The Active Directory Installation Wizard screen appears, remove the CD-ROM, click Finish and then click Restart Now.</li></p>

<p>It will take longer for windows 2000 server to start the first time as a domain controller.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 2: Viewing your domain</b></li></p>

<p>In this procedure, you view your domain.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on to Server01 as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Double-click My Network Places.</li></p>

<p>The My Network Places window appears.</p>

<p><li>Double-click Entire Network, and then click the link on the left side of the window that says, You May Also View The Entire Contents Of The Network.</li></p>

<p><li>Double-click Microsoft Windows Network.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the network Microsoft appears.</p>

<p><li>Close My Network Places.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 3: Using Active Directory Manager</b></li></p>

<p>In this procedure, you use Active Directory Users And Computers to view your domain.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Active Directory Users And Computers.</li></p>

<p>The Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in appears.</p>

<p><li>In the console tree, click on the + sign to the left of microsoft.com.</li></p>

<p><li>Examine each of the containers below microsoft.com. Do not modify any information that you see in these nodes.</li></p>

<p>What selections are listed under microsoft.com and what is their purpose? Hint, choose the properties of each container in the console tree to view their purpose.</p>

<A NAME="266"><h3>Exercise 2: Joining Server02 to the Domain</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, Server02 will join the microsoft.com domain. Because DHCP is not in use at this point in your training, you will manually configure IP address information on Server01 and Server02. When Server02 joins the domain, a computer account in the domain will be created for Server02. This computer account will appear in the Active Directory store. Both computers will be used to complete this exercise.</p>

<A NAME="268"><h3>Exercise 4: Changing from Stand-Alone Dfs to Domain Dfs</h3></A>
<p>In <a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a>, you installed stand-alone Microsoft distributed file system (Dfs). In this exercise, you will delete the stand-alone Dfs, create a domain Dfs, and create a Dfs root replica since you are now running a domain controller. You will use Server01 and Server02 to complete the procedures in this exercise.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Deleting the stand-alone Dfs root</b></li></p>

<p>Only one Dfs root can exist on a server. Therefore the stand-alone Dfs must first be deleted on Server01.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then point to Administrative Tools.</li></p>

<p><li>From the Administrative tools group, click Distributed File System.</li></p>

<p>The Distributed File System snap-in appears.</p>

<p><li>In the console tree, click \\SERVER01\Public.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, and then click Delete Dfs Root.</li></p>

<p>A Distributed File System message box appears stating that deleting the Dfs root disables the ability to access the Dfs again. This procedure does not delete the shares that were linked to the Dfs root.</p>

<p><li>Click Yes.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 2: Creating a domain Dfs</b></li></p>

<p>The domain Dfs will be configured similarly to the stand-alone Dfs, but it will provide file replication to the Dfs link replicas. Complete this procedure on Server01.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the console tree of the Distributed File System snap-in, click Distributed File System.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, and then click New Dfs Root.</li></p>

<p>The New Dfs Root wizard appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Select The Dfs Root Type screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Select the Create A Domain Dfs Root radio button, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Select The Host Domain For The Dfs Root screen appears, and microsoft.com appears in the Domain Name text box and in the Trusting Domains box.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Specify The Host Server For The Dfs Root Screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Notice that server01.microsoft.com is shown in the Server Name text box.</li></p>

<p>If Server01 was still hosting the stand-alone Dfs, its name would not be written in the Server Name text box. This is intentional because a server can only host a single Dfs root.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Specify The Dfs Root Share screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Use An Existing Share radio button is selected, and then from the drop-down list box, select Public.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Comment text box appearing on the Name The Dfs Root screen, type <b>Public access share</b> and then click Next.</li></p>

<A NAME="269"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The Active Directory Installation wizard is used to install Active Directory services onto a Windows 2000 Server computer. The Active Directory Installation wizard is also used to add a domain control to an existing domain, create the first domain controller in a new domain, create a new child domain, or create a new domain tree. When you install Active Directory services, the database, the database log files, and the shared system volume are automatically created. The directory database is stored in a file named Ntds.dit. The Ntds.dit file contains the Active Directory store. The shared system volume is a folder structure that exists on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and some of the group policy objects for both the current domain as well as the enterprise. There are two domain modes: Mixed mode and Native mode. When you first install or upgrade a domain controller to Windows 2000 Server, the domain controller runs in Mixed mode. When all the domain controllers in the domain run Windows 2000 Server, and you do not plan to add any more down-level domain controllers to the domain, you can switch the domain from Mixed mode to Native mode.</p>

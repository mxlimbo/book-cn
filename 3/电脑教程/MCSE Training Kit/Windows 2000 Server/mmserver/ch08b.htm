<A NAME="369"><h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Windows 2000 Printing</h1></A>
<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 Server is designed for network printing. Using a variety of platforms, applications send print jobs to printers attached to a Windows 2000 print server or connected to the network by internal network adapters, external network adapters (print server devices), or another server. By using a computer that is running Windows 2000 Server as your network print server, you can print from any supported operating system that your networked computers use. This lesson introduces you to network printing by first reviewing the terminology used in print services and providing guidelines for setting up a network printing environment. This lesson also reviews the issues involved in local and remote printing and with print devices that are either attached through the network or directly to the computer.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Define the terms used in Windows 2000 printing</li></p>

<p><li>Define the requirements and guidelines for a network printing environment</li></p>

<p><li>Describe the different printing scenarios for local and remote printing for print devices attached to the network and for print devices attached directly to the computer</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 35 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="370"><h2>Terminology</h2></A>
<p>Before you set up printing, you should be familiar with Windows 2000 printing terminology to understand how the different components fit together, as shown in Figure 8.1.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f08xx01gx.htm')"> <img src="images/f08xx01g.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.1</b> <i>Printing terminology</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>If you are new to Windows 2000, you might find some of the printing terminology to be different from what you expected (although printing terminology has not changed significantly from that used in Microsoft Windows NT Server). The following list defines a few Windows 2000 printing terms:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Printer</b> A printer is the software interface between the operating system and the print device. The printer defines where a document will go to reach the print device (that is, to a local port, a port for a network connection, or a file), when it will go, and how various other aspects of the printing process will be handled. When users make connections to printers, they use printer names, which point to one or more print devices.</li></p>


<p><li><b>Print device</b> A print device is the hardware device that produces printed documents. Windows 2000 supports the following print devices:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li><i>Local print devices</i> are those that are connected to a physical port on the print server. A local print device is connected to the computer by a local interface, such as a parallel, serial RS-232/422/IRDA, USB, or SCSI port.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Network print devices</i> are those that are connected to a print server through the network instead of a physical port. Network print devices, also called <i>network-interface print devices,</i> require their own network interface cards and have their own network address or they are attached to an external network adapter. A networked printer is a node on the network; computers send print jobs to it through a network adapter, which might be built in.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li><b>Print server</b> A print server is the computer on which the printers associated with local and network print devices reside. The print server receives and processes documents from client computers. You set up and share network printers on print servers.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Printer driver</b> A printer driver is one or more files containing information that Windows 2000 requires to convert print commands into a specific printer language, such as PostScript. This conversion makes it possible for a print device to print a document. A printer driver is specific to each print device model.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="371"><h2>Requirements for Network Printing</h2></A>
<p>The requirements for setting up printing on a Windows 2000 network include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>At least one computer to operate as the print server. If the print server will manage many heavily used printers, Microsoft recommends a dedicated print server. The computer can run either of the following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Windows 2000 Server, which can handle a large number of connections and supports client computers running MS-DOS, Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and NetWare client redirectors and printing services.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows 2000 Professional, which is limited to 10 concurrent connections from other computers for file and print services. It does not support Macintosh computers or NetWare clients but does support MS-DOS, Windows, and UNIX computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li>Sufficient random access memory (RAM) to process documents. If a print server manages a large number of printers or many large documents, the server might require additional RAM beyond what Windows 2000 requires for other tasks. If a print server does not have sufficient RAM for its workload, printing performance deteriorates.</li></p>

<p><li>Sufficient disk space on the print server to ensure that Windows 2000 can store documents and other printable data sent to the print server until the print server sends the data to the print device. This is critical when documents are large or likely to accumulate. For example, if 10 users send large documents to print at the same time, the print server must have enough disk space to hold all the spooled documents in the print queue until the print server sends them to the print device. If there is not enough space to hold all the documents, users will get error messages and be unable to print.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Spooled print jobs can be significantly larger than the actual data the print application reads. This is because print jobs are sent through the printer device driver to prepare the data for the printer.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="372"><h2>Guidelines for a Network Printing Environment</h2></A>
<p>Before you set up network printing, develop a network-wide printing strategy to meet users' printing needs without unnecessary duplication of resources or delays in printing. The following table provides some guidelines for developing a network printing strategy:</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Guideline</th> <th valign="top">Explanation</th></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Determine users' printing requirements.</td>
<td valign="top">Determine the number of users who print and the printing workload. For example, 15 people in a billing department who print invoices continually will have a larger printing workload and might require more printers, print devices, and possibly more print servers than 15 software developers who do all their work online.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Determine company's printing requirements.</td>
<td valign="top">Determine the printing needs of your company. This  includes the number and types of print devices required. In addition, consider the type of workload each print device will handle. Do not use a personal print device for network printing.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Determine the number of print servers required.</td>
<td valign="top">Determine the number of print servers your network requires to handle the number and types of printers your network will have.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Determine where to locate print devices.</td>
<td valign="top">Determine where you will locate the print devices. In a  routed network, consider placing the print servers and print devices on the same network with the client computers that will use them. Additionally, it should be easy for users to pick up their printed documents.</td></tr>
</table>

<A NAME="373"><h2>Printing Configurations</h2></A>
<p>Several combinations of clients, servers, and print devices are possible
with Windows 2000, depending on whether the print device is remote or nonremote. A remote print device is accessed through a print server. A nonremote print device receives data directly from the computer. The combination of clients, servers, and print devices also depends on whether the print device is networked or directly attached to the computer.</p>

<p>The following figures show four basic printing configurations. The thin lines represent physical connections, such as network or parallel cables, and the arrows represent the logical print data flow.</p>

<p>Figure 8.2 shows the simplest configuration, a nonremote, local print device. The print device is plugged into the parallel port of the computer that runs the application. The printer driver and job queue are on that computer, which sends print data directly to the print device.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f08xx02g.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.2</b> <i>A nonremote, local print device</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Figure 8.3 shows a small group of computers sharing a network print device. This is a peer-to-peer network, where each computer has equal access to the print device and there is no central control of printing or security. Each computer has its own job queue and cannot see the documents queued on the print device by other computers. If printing halts, the error message does not appear on every client. This is acceptable for small organizations where the users are in frequent contact, but it becomes less manageable as traffic increases. Contention among computers submitting documents might cause the print device to time out or reject print jobs.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.3</b> <i>A nonremote, network print device</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Figure 8.4 illustrates a network configuration using a central print server. Many clients share access to the print device through the server, which is locally connected to the print device. The job queue resides on the server and is visible to each client.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.4</b> <i>Remote, local print device</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Printing is controlled by the server administrator. The administrator defines and enforces a security plan for the network, maintains the printer software, and downloads it to clients when they connect to the printer share. When a client connects to a network print queue, the client checks for new printer drivers on the print server and updates older printer drivers on the client.</p>

<p>Clients might also be connected to other print devices, and the print server often has several attached print devices. However, the number of parallel ports on the print server limits the number of print devices that can be directly attached to it.</p>

<p>Figure 8.5 shows several clients sharing a print device in a domain managed by a computer that is running Windows 2000 Server; the print device is connected to the server over the network, allowing one print server to manage several print devices.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.5</b> <i>Remote, network print devices</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>To create and share printers, use the Add Printer wizard on the print server. The Add Printer wizard is located in the Printers folder, which you can access on the Start menu by clicking Settings and then clicking Printers. Regardless of where the print devices are located, the printer software must be located on the print server. If the print device is directly attached, the wizard detects it and then attempts to configure the printer software. If the print device is attached elsewhere on the network, you must create a port for it when you configure the printer software. You can also use the Add Printer wizard to connect to remote print devices. When doing so, remember the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><i>Creating a printer</i> means installing the print device either directly on a print server or on the network, and then configuring the printer software that controls the print device on the print server. Run the Add Printer wizard, and click the Local Computer option. You must name the printer, install the printer driver, and specify a port.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Connecting to a printer</i> means connecting to the share on the computer that created the printer. To connect to a printer, run the Add Printer wizard and click the Network Printer option. If the printer driver for the client platform exists on the print server, installing it is not necessary because Windows 2000 downloads it automatically. This includes printer drivers for Windows 95, Windows 98, and all versions of Windows NT. Otherwise, you will be prompted to install the printer software.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="374"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>A printer is the software interface between the operating system and the print device. A print device is the hardware device that produces printed documents. A print server is the computer on which the printers associated with local and network print devices reside. A printer driver is one or more files containing information that Windows 2000 requires to convert print commands into a specific printer language. You should also be familiar with the requirements for network printing, which include at least one computer to operate as the print server, sufficient RAM, and sufficient disk space. You should also determine the users' print requirements, the company's requirements, the number of print servers required, and where to locate print devices. Several combinations of clients, servers, and print devices are possible with Windows 2000, depending on whether the print device is local or remote and whether it is networked or directly attached to the computer.</p>

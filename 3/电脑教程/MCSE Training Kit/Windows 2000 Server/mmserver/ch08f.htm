<A NAME="408"><h1>Lesson 5: Connecting to Network Printers</h1></A>
<p>After you have set up the print server with all required printer drivers for the shared printers, users on client computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 can easily make a connection and start printing. For most Windows-based client computers, the client computer automatically downloads the printer when the user makes a connection to the printer, as long as the appropriate printer drivers are on the print server.</p>

<p>Other client computers able to access a share or print to an IP address can use printers configured for sharing on a Windows 2000 Server print server. The connect-to-printer capability is available only in Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 computers.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Make a connection to a network printer by using the Add Printer wizard or a Web browser</li></p>

<p><li>Describe how printer drivers are downloaded</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="409"><h2>Using the Add Printer Wizard</h2></A>
<p>When you add and share a printer, by default, all users can make a connection to that printer and print documents. The method used to make a connection to a printer depends on the client computer. Client computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000 can use the Add Printer wizard, although the Add Printer wizard in Windows 2000 provides more features than in the earlier versions. This is the same wizard you use to add and share a printer. The options available in the Add Printer wizard that allow you to locate and connect to a printer vary depending on the operating system the client computer is running.</p>

<p>Client computers running Windows 2000 can also use a Web browser to make a connection to the printer.</p>

<A NAME="410"><h3>Client Computers Running Windows 2000</h3></A>
<p>By using the Add Printer wizard on client computers running Windows 2000, you can make a connection to a printer with any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Searching Active Directory services</b> You can find the printer by using Active Directory services search capabilities. You can search either the entire Active Directory store or just a portion of it. You can also narrow the search by providing features of the printer, such as color printing. An easy way to search is by clicking Start, pointing to Search, and then clicking the For Printers option.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Using the universal naming convention (UNC) name</b> You can use the UNC name (\\&lt;<i>print_server</i>&gt;\&lt;<i>share</i>&gt;) to make connections, which can be a quick method to use.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Browsing the network for the printer</b> You can browse for a printer by clicking Browse.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="411"><h3>Client Computers Running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT</h3></A>
<p>On client computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT, the Add Printer wizard allows you to enter a UNC name or to browse Network Neighborhood to locate the printer.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can also make a connection to a printer by using the Run command on the Start menu. Type the UNC name of the printer in the Open text box, and click OK.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="412"><h3>Client Computers Running Other Microsoft Operating Systems</h3></A>
<p>Users at client computers running Windows 3.<i>x</i> and Windows for Workgroups use Print Manager instead of the Add Printer wizard to make a connection
to a printer.</p>

<p>Users at any Windows-based client computer can make a connection to a network printer by using the following command:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5><tr><td>
<PRE>net use lpt&lt;<i>x</i>&gt;: \\&lt;<i>print_server</i>&gt;\&lt;<i>share</i>&gt;</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>

<p>Note that <i>x</i> is the number of the printer port.</p>

<p>The net use command is the only method available for making a connection to a network printer from client computers running MS-DOS or OS/2 with Microsoft LAN Manager client software installed.</p>

<p>Automatic printer driver download upon connection is not available for these operating systems. Use the local computer operating system's driver installation procedure to install a printer driver for these clients.</p>

<A NAME="413"><h2>Using a Web Browser</h2></A>
<p>If you are using a computer running Windows 2000, you can make a connection to a printer through your corporate intranet. You can type a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in your Web browser, and you do not have to use the Add Printer wizard. In the address field of the Web browser, type the <i>http://</i>&lt;<i>print_server</i>&gt;<i>/</i>&lt;<i>share</i>&gt; URL of the printer and then click the Connect link on the page that appears. Figure 8.14 shows the Web page that is displayed at the conclusion of the printer connection.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.14</b> <i>Connecting and installing a printer through a Web browser</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>After you make a connection, Windows 2000 automatically copies the correct printer drivers to the client computer.</p>

<p>There are two URLs you can use to make a connection to a printer by using a Web browser:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b><i>http://&lt;print_server&gt;/printers</i></b> The Web page lists all the shared printers on the print server that you have permission to use. The page includes information about the printers, including the printer name, status of print jobs, location, model, and any comments entered when the printers were installed. This information helps you select the correct printer for your needs. You must have permission to use the printer.</li></p>

<p><li><b><i>http://&lt;print_server&gt;/&lt;share&gt;</i></b> You provide the intranet path for a specific printer. You must have permission to use the printer.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You can customize the Web page that is used for printer connections. For example, you might want to display a floor plan that shows the location of print devices to which users can connect.</p>

<p>For a Windows 2000 print server to accept print requests containing URLs, it must be configured in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Windows 2000 Server software with Microsoft IIS installed</li></p>

<p><li>Windows 2000 Professional with Microsoft PWS installed</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="414"><h2>Downloading Printer Drivers</h2></A>
<p>When users at client computers running Windows 95,Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000 make the first connection to a printer on the print server, the client computer automatically downloads the printer driver. The print server must have a copy of the printer driver installed. Additional printer drivers are installed from the Additional Drivers button under the Sharing tab of the printer's Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>Printer drivers are platform specific. Therefore, if you will be providing connect and download printer driver support for multiple Windows NT platforms, make sure to install the platform-specific driver. For example, to support both Alpha-based and <i>x</i>86-based Windows NT client computers, install both drivers on the print server. The Windows 2000 printer drivers are not compatible with Windows NT printer drivers. Therefore, if you are running an <i>x</i>86-based Windows 2000 print server and plan to support <i>x</i>86-based Windows NT clients, make sure to install the <i>x</i>86-based Windows NT printer drivers. In the Additional Drivers window, the <i>x</i>86-based printer drivers list Intel under the Environment column. However, these drivers work for non-Intel <i>x</i>86-based platforms as well.</p>

<p>Client computers running Windows 2000 and Windows NT verify that they have the current printer driver each time they print. If they do not have the current printer driver, they download it. For these client computers, you only need to update printer drivers on the print server. Client computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98 do not check for updated printer drivers. You must manually install updated printer drivers on these clients.</p>

<A NAME="415"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Clients running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 can use the Add Printer wizard to connect to a printer. Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT computers can use UNC names or browse Network Neighborhood. Computers running Windows 3.<i>x</i> and Windows for Workgroups use Print Manager to connect to a printer. Any Windows or MS-DOS computer can use the net use command to connect to a printer. Windows 2000 computers can search Active Directory services, use a UNC name, and browse the network for the printer. Windows 2000 computers can also make a connection through a Web browser. When users at client computers running Windows 95,Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000 make the first connection to a printer on the print server, the client computer automatically downloads the printer driver from the print server.</p>

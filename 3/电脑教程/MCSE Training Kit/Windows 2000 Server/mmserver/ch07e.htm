<A NAME="343"><h1>Lesson 4: Administering Group Policies</h1></A>
<p>Group policies provide a facility for further refining and centralizing management of a user's desktop environment. Group policies can be used to control the programs that are available to users, the programs that appear on a user's desktop, and the Start menu options.</p>

<p>Typically, you will not set group policies; rather group policy administrators configure and administer them. Group policies are typically set for the entire domain or network and are used to enforce corporate policies. However, even if you do not administer group policies, they affect the user accounts, groups, computers, and OUs that you administer. You should be aware of what group policies are and be familiar with the different types of group policies.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the structure of group policies, including group policy objects, containers, and templates</li></p>

<p><li>Explain the hierarchy of applying group policies, including the rule of inheritance and methods for modifying inheritance of policies</li></p>

<p><li>Use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in to create a group policy object and modify the settings in that object</li></p>

<p><li>Use the Group Policy snap-in to specify group policy settings for computers and users</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 90 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="344"><h2>Introduction to Group Policies</h2></A>
<p>Group policies are a set of configuration settings that a group policy administrator applies to one or more objects in the Active Directory store. A group policy administrator uses group policies to control the work environments for users in a domain. Group policies can also control the work environment of users with accounts that are located in a specific OU. In addition, group policies can be set at the site level, using the Active Directory Sites And Services snap-in.</p>

<p>A group policy consists of settings that govern how an object and its child objects behave. Group policies allow a group policy administrator to provide users with a fully populated desktop environment. This environment can include a customized Start menu, applications that are automatically set up, and restricted access to files, folders, and Microsoft Windows 2000 system settings. Group policies can also affect rights that are granted to user accounts and groups.</p>

<p>Conflicts can exist between group policies and local needs, such as when a policy restricts a user's ability to gain access to a resource that the user needs to perform his or her job. When this occurs, you must work with the group policy administrator to resolve the conflict. For example, if a group policy that is applied at the domain level prevents users in your network from gaining access to an application that they need to perform their jobs, contact the group policy administrator to correct the situation.</p>

<p>There is an exception to always having to contact the group policy administrator; you can unlock a user account that a group policy locked out. However, be aware that you should not perform tasks that a group policy overrides if the group policy overrides profile settings.</p>

<A NAME="345"><h3>Benefits of Group Policy</h3></A>
<p>Total cost of ownership (TCO) is the cost involved in administering distributed personal computer networks. Recent studies on TCO cite lost user productivity as one of the major costs to corporations. Lost productivity is often due to user error, such as modifying system configuration files and thereby rendering the computer unusable, or it is attributed to the confusing array of unessential applications and features available to the user.</p>

<p>You can lower your network's TCO by using group policies to create a managed desktop environment tailored to the user's job responsibilities and experience level.</p>

<p><b>Securing a User's Environment</b></p>

<p>As an administrator in a high-security network, you might want to create a locked down environment on a computer. By implementing appropriate group policy settings for specific users, combined with NTFS permissions, mandatory profiles, and other Windows 2000 security features, you can prevent users from installing software and accessing unauthorized programs or data. You can also prevent users from deleting files that are important to the proper functioning of their applications or operating system.</p>

<p><b>Enhancing a User's Environment</b></p>

<p>You can use group policy to enhance a user's environment by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Automatically delivering applications to a user's Start menu</li></p>

<p><li>Enabling application distribution so that users can easily find applications on the network and install them</li></p>

<p><li>Delivering files or shortcuts to useful places on the network or to a specific folder on a user's computer</li></p>

<p><li>Automating the execution of tasks or programs when a user logs on or off and when a computer starts or shuts down</li></p>

<p><li>Redirect folders to network locations to increase data reliability</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="346"><h3>Types of Group Policies</h3></A>
<p>Group policies influence a variety of network components and Active Directory objects. The following table describes the types of group policies:</p>


<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Type of group policy  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Software Settings  </td>
<td valign="top">Affects the applications to which users can gain access. These policies make application installations automatic in two ways: <p><b>Application assignment</b> The group policy installs or upgrades applications automatically on the client computers or provides the user with a connection to an application, which she or he cannot delete.</p> <p><b>Application publication</b> The group policy administrator publishes applications via Active Directory services. The applications then appear in the list of components that a user can install by using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. Users can uninstall these applications.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Scripts  </td>
<td valign="top">Allows group policy administrators to specify scripts and batch files to run at specified times, such as during system startup or system shutdown, or when a user logs on or logs off. Scripts automate repetitive tasks, such as mapping network drives.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Security Settings  </td>
<td valign="top">Allows group policy administrators to restrict user access
to files and folders, configure account restrictions (such as how many incorrect passwords a user can enter before Windows 2000 locks out the user account), set local policy (such as user rights and auditing), control service operation, restrict registry and Event Log access, set public key access, and configure IP security (IPSec) policy.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Administrative Templates </td>
<td valign="top"> Includes registry-based group policies, which you use to  mandate registry settings that govern the behavior and appearance of the desktop, including the operating system components and applications.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="347"><h2>Group Policy Structure</h2></A>
<p><i>Group policies</i> are collections of configuration settings that can be applied to one or more objects in the Active Directory store. These settings are contained within a group policy object (GPO). <i>Group policy objects</i> store group policy information in two locations: containers and templates.</p>

<A NAME="348"><h3>Group Policy Objects</h3></A>
<p>A GPO contains group policy settings for sites, domains, and OUs. Group policy objects contain properties that are written to the Active Directory store in an object called the <i>group policy container</i> (GPC). In addition, GPOs store group policy information in a folder structure called the <i>group policy template</i> (GPT). The underlying structure of the GPO is, for the most part, hidden from the administrator.</p>

<p>One or more GPOs can be applied to a site, domain, or OU. Multiple containers in the Active Directory store can be associated with the same GPO, and a single container can have more than one GPO associated with it. Filtering the scope of the GPO is accomplished through membership in security groups.</p>

<p>Group policy data that is small in size and changes infrequently is stored
in GPCs. Group policy data that is large and can change frequently is stored in the GPT.</p>

<p><b>Local Group Policy Objects</b></p>

<p>A local GPO exists on every Windows 2000 computer and, by default, only security settings are configured. The local GPO is stored in the %systemroot%\System32\GroupPolicy folder, and it has the following ACL permissions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Administrators: Full Control</li></p>

<p><li>SYSTEM: Full Control</li></p>

<p><li>Authenticated Users: Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents, and Read</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
SYSTEM and Authenticated Users are system groups.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="349"><h3>Group Policy Containers</h3></A>
<p>A GPC is an Active Directory object that stores GPO properties and includes subcontainers for computer and user group policy information. The GPC contains version information to ensure that the information contained within the GPC is synchronized with the GPT information. The GPC also contains status information that indicates whether the GPO is enabled or disabled.</p>

<p>The GPC stores the Windows 2000 class store information for application deployment. The <i>class store</i> is a server-based repository for all applications, interfaces, and APIs that provide application publishing and assigning functions.</p>

<A NAME="350"><h3>Group Policy Templates</h3></A>
<p>The GPT is a folder structure in the %systemroot%\SYSVOL\sysvol\
&lt;<i>domain_name</i>&gt;\Policies folder of domain controllers. The GPT is the container where policy settings for administrative templates, security settings, script files, and software settings are stored.</p>

<p><b>GPT Structure</b></p>

<p>When a GPO is created, the corresponding GPT folder structure is created. The folder name given to the GPT is the GUID of the GPO that was created. For example, if a GPO is created that is associated with a domain called microsoft.com, the resulting GPT folder would be named as follows:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>%systemroot%\SYSVOL\sysvol\microsoft.com\Policies\
{45265FA6-554F-4F74-97CC-61B4663DAE61}</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The above GUID is an example.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>GPT Contents</b></p>

<p>Typically the default contents of the GPT are the User and Machine subfolders and a Gpt.ini file. As you create and modify policies, additional folders are created. The specific folder structure depends on the group policies that you set. The following table describes some of the subfolders that are often contained in the GPT structure:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Subfolder  </th>
<th>Contents  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Adm  </td>
<td valign="top">The .adm template files that are associated with a specific GPT. The .adm files are text files that are processed by Windows 2000 to apply changes to the registry.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User  </td>
<td valign="top">A Registry.pol file with the registry settings to apply to users.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User\Applications  </td>
<td valign="top">The advertisement files (.aas files) used by the Microsoft Windows Installer for software packages published to users.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User\Documents &amp; Settings </td>
<td valign="top">Any files to deploy to the user's desktop as part of this GPT.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User\Scripts   </td>
<td valign="top">The Logon and Logoff subfolders.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User\Scripts\Logon  </td>
<td valign="top">The scripts and related files for logon scripting.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\User\Scripts\Logoff  </td>
<td valign="top">The scripts and related files for logoff scripting.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine  </td>
<td valign="top">A Registry.pol file with the registry setting to apply to computers.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Applications  </td>
<td valign="top">The advertisement files (.aas files) used by the Windows  Installer for packages published to computers.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Documents &amp; Settings  </td>
<td valign="top">Any files to deploy to all desktops for all users who log on  to this computer as part of this GPT.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Microsoft\WindowsNT\SecEdit   </td>
<td valign="top">The GptTmpl.ini Security Editor file.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Scripts </td>
<td valign="top">The Startup and Shutdown subfolders.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Scripts\Startup  </td>
<td valign="top">The scripts and related files for startup scripting.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\Machine\Scripts\Shutdown  </td>
<td valign="top">The scripts and related files for shutdown scripting.  </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><b>Gpt.ini File</b></p>

<p>The root folder of each GPT contains a file called Gpt.ini. The following entries can be included in this file:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Version=<i>x</i></b> Where <i>x</i> represents the version number of the GPO. The version number begins at 0 when you first create the GPO and then is automatically incremented by 1 each time you modify the GPO.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disabled=<i>y</i></b> Where <i>y</i> is either 0 or 1 and refers only to the local GPO. This switch indicates whether the local GPO is enabled or disabled. The Gpt.ini file defines whether the local GPO is disabled or enabled; for all other GPOs, this information is stored in the GPC contained in the Active Directory store.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Registry.pol File</b></p>

<p>The Registry.pol file in the User subfolder is downloaded and applied to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER section of the registry when the user logs on. The Registry.pol file in the Machine subfolder is downloaded and applied to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the registry during the boot process of the computer.</p>

<p>The format of the Registry.pol files differs from those created by using the System Policy Editor for Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0. Files created by using the earlier version of the System Policy Editor cannot be applied to Windows 2000 computers, and files created with the Windows 2000 Group Policy snap-in cannot be applied to Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0 computers.</p>

<A NAME="351"><h2>Applying Group Policies</h2></A>
<p>Before you can create group policies, you must create the group policy objects. From there you can edit group policies, manage permissions, and manage inheritance.</p>

<A NAME="352"><h3>Creating a GPO</h3></A>
<p>The first step in creating a group policy is to create or open a GPO. You can create a group policy object for a domain or an OU by using the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. You can create a group policy object for a site by using the Active Directory Sites And Services snap-in. In both cases, the process is the same.</p>

<p>To create a group policy object, open the properties for the site, domain, or OU object. In the Properties dialog box, select the Group Policy tab. Click New and enter a name for the object. Figure 7.12 shows how to create a GPO.</p>

</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
You can also add an existing GPO by clicking Add and selecting GPOs from sites, domains, and OUs.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="353"><h3>Using the Group Policy Snap-In</h3></A>
<p>The Group Policy snap-in is the administrator's primary tool for defining and controlling how programs, network resources, and the operating system behave for users and computers in an organization. In an Active Directory services environment, group policies are applied to users or computers on the basis of their membership in sites, domains, or OUs.</p>

<p>Once you have created a GPO, you can use the Group Policy snap-in to specify group policy settings for computers and user accounts. Figure 7.13 shows the Group Policy snap-in.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f07xx13x.htm')"> <img src="images/f07xx13.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.13</b> <i>The Group Policy snap-in that appears by clicking the Edit button as shown in Figure 7.12</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p><b>Group Policy Snap-In Interface</b></p>

<p>The Group Policy snap-in includes the Computer Configuration node and the User Configuration node. Each node displays the following extensions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Software Settings</li></p>

<p><li>Windows Settings</li></p>

<p><li>Administrative Templates</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Computer Configuration</b></p>

<p>The Computer Configuration node's folders contain settings you can use to customize the user's environment or enforce lockdown policies for computers on the network. Computer Configuration policies apply when the operating system initializes. If you assign user policies to computers, the user policies apply to every user who logs on to the computer, regardless of the OU to which the user belongs.</p>

<p><b>User Configuration</b></p>

<p>The User Configuration node's folders contain settings that you can use to customize the user's environment or enforce lockdown policies for users on the network. These settings include all user-specific policies, such as desktop appearance, application settings, logon and logoff scripts, and assigned and published applications. User Configuration policies apply when the user logs on to the computer.</p>

<p><b>Using the Group Policy Snap-In</b></p>

<p>Each instance of the Group Policy snap-in is specific to a GPO. You can add a GPO-specific Group Policy snap-in to an MMC console to use as a stand-alone tool. This allows you to add a snap-in for each GPO that you want to administer. You can also open the Group Policy snap-in for a particular GPO through the site, domain, or OU where the GPO is located. Finally, you can edit the local GPO by using Gpedit.msc.</p>

<p><b>Creating an MMC Console</b></p>

<p>By using an MMC console, you can create a tool that contains a Group Policy snap-in for each GPO you want to administer. After you open the MMC interface, add Group Policy as a stand-alone snap-in. When you add the snap-in, you must select the GPO associated with that snap-in. You can add the local GPO, which is the default setting, or you can browse for GPOs that are in sites, domains, or OUs (Figure 7.14). You can also browse for the local GPO on any computers in your domain. Once you've added a Group Policy snap-in for each GPO you are going to administer, save the MMC console as an .mmc file. You can then open the file at any time to administer the GPOs you added to the console. You can also add or delete GPOs as necessary.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.14</b> <i>Browsing for all group policies created in the microsoft.com domain</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p><b>Editing a GPO in Sites, Domains, and OUs</b></p>

<p>To create and edit a GPO, open the Group Policy snap-in for a specific GPO from a site, domain, or OU. For sites, use the Active Directory Sites And Services snap-in. For domains and OUs, use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. Open the Properties dialog box for the site, domain, or OU, and select the Group Policy tab. Select the GPO you want to administer, and click Edit. This launches the Group Policy snap-in for that specific object. This navigation is shown in Figures 7.12 and 7.13. At this point, you can edit the GPO as necessary.</p>

<p><b>Using Gpedit.msc</b></p>

<p>You can edit the local GPO by using Gpedit.msc. From the Run command, type <b>gpedit.msc</b> and click OK. This launches the Group Policy snap-in for the GPO on the local computer. From there, you can edit the GPO as necessary.</p>

<p>You can perform remote group policy administration by using the gpcomputer: &lt;<i>computername</i>&gt; parameter or the gpobject parameter with Gpedit.msc. The <i>computername</i> variable used with gpcomputer can be either a NetBIOS name or a DNS name. To view and configure the domain GPO for Server01 in the microsoft.com domain, you can type:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>gpedit.msc /gpcomputer:&quot;server01&quot;</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>or</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>gpedit.msc /gpcomputer:&quot;server01.microsoft.com&quot;</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>The gpcomputer parameter is designed to display the domain GPO. The gpobject parameter requires an ADSI path and can open any GPO created in the Active Directory store. For example, to open a GPO with a GUID of 45265FA6-554F-4F74-97CC-61B4663DAE61 in the microsoft.com domain, you can type:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>gpedit.msc /gpobject:&quot;LDAP://CN={45265FA6-554F-4F74-97CC-
61B4663DAE61},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=microsoft,DC=com&quot;</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<A NAME="354"><h3>GPO Permissions</h3></A>
<p>When you create a GPO, a set of groups is added to the object and each of those groups is configured with a set of properties. By default, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and System groups are granted Read, Write, Create All Child Objects, and Delete All Child Objects permissions to the GPO. The Creator Owner system group is also assigned special permissions to manage child objects within the GPO. The Authenticated Users system group is given Read And Apply Group Policy access. Note that by default, only the Authenticated Users group is granted the Apply Group Policy attribute. Except for the Authenticated Users group, members of the other groups can edit the GPO. The policy settings contained in the GPO do not apply to members of a group that has been denied the Apply Group Policy permission (Deny).</p>

<p>Administrators can specify which groups of users and computers have Apply Group Policy access to the object. Groups that have Apply Group Policy and Read access to the GPO receive the configured group policy settings contained in the object.</p>

<p>The following table lists a GPO's default groups and their properties:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Security group  </th>
<th>Default settings  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Authenticated Users  </td>
<td valign="top">Read, Apply Group Policy (AGP)  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Creator Owner  </td>
<td valign="top">Special oObject and Attribute permissions assigned to child objects and properties within the GPO  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain Admins  </td>
<td valign="top">Read, Write, Create All Child Objects, Delete All Child Objects  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Enterprise Admins  </td>
<td valign="top">Read, Write, Create All Child Objects, Delete All Child Objects  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">System   </td>
<td valign="top">Read, Write, Create All Child Objects, Delete All Child Objects  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p>Administrators are also authenticated users, which means that they have the Apply Group Policy attribute set. If this is not desired, administrators have two choices:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Remove Authenticated Users from the list, and add another security group with the Apply Group Policy attribute set to Allow. This new group should contain all the users that the GPO is intended to affect.</li></p>

<p><li>Set the Apply Group Policy attribute to Deny for the Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins groups and possibly the Creator Owner group. This will prevent the GPO from being applied to members of those groups. Remember that a permission set to Deny always takes precedence over Allow. Therefore, even if a user is a member of another group that has been granted the Apply Group Policy permission, the user will still be denied.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To edit a GPO, the user must have both Read and Write access to the object. A GPO cannot be opened in Read-Only mode. In other words, if you can open the Group Policy snap-in, you can edit the Group Policy object that appears in the namespace. Moreover, the changes occur during the edit; there is no Save or Activate step. An administrator might want to unlink a GPO from any site, domain, or OU during the edit, or he or she might want to leave it linked, but disable both the User and Computer nodes.</p>

<p>You cannot use security groups to apply (or prevent from applying) only some of the settings in a Group Policy object&#8212;except in the cases of Folder Redirection and Software Installation, which have additional ACLs set at the GPO level to further refine behavior based on security group membership.</p>

<p>To edit a GPO, the user must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>An administrator</li></p>

<p><li>A Creator Owner</li></p>

<p><li>A user with delegated access to the Group Policy object</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You can modify the permissions on a GPO by opening the Properties dialog box for the site, domain, or OU that contains the GPO and then selecting the Group Policy tab. Select the GPO, click Properties, and select the Security tab, as shown in Figure 7.15.</p>

<p>From there, you can modify the basic permissions or click the Advanced button to modify advanced permissions.</p>

<p><b>Order of Inheritance</b></p>

<p>In general, a group policy is passed down from parent to child containers. If you have assigned a specific group policy to a high-level parent container, that group policy applies to all containers beneath the parent container, including the user and computer objects in each container. However, if you explicitly specify a group policy setting for a child container, the child container's group policy setting overrides the parent container's setting.</p>

<p>If a parent OU has policy settings that are not configured, the child OU doesn't inherit them. Policy settings that are disabled are inherited as disabled. Also, if a policy is configured for a parent OU and the same policy is not configured for a child OU, the child inherits the parent's policy setting.</p>

<p>If a parent policy and a child policy are compatible, the child inherits the parent policy and the child's setting is also applied. Policies are inherited as long as they are compatible. For example, if the parent's policy causes a certain folder to be placed on the desktop and the child's setting calls for an additional folder, the user sees both folders.</p>

<p>If a policy configured for a parent OU is incompatible with the same policy configured for a child OU, the child does not inherit the policy setting from the parent. The setting in the child is applied.</p>

<p>You can use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in to configure inheritance for domains and OUs. Open the Properties dialog box for the domain or OU, and select the Group Policy tab. In addition, you can configure inheritance for sites by using the Active Directory Sites And Services snap-in. Open the Properties dialog box for the specific site, and select the Group Policy tab. There are two options you can use to configure inheritance: the Block Policy Inheritance check box and the No Override check box.</p>

<p><b>Block Policy Inheritance</b></p>

<p>You can block inheritance of policies at the domain or OU levels by using the Block Policy Inheritance check box. This check box is located on the first tab of each GPO's Properties dialog box. Block policy inheritance is not available to a site policy since a site is at the top of the GPO hierarchy. If this option is selected for a child-level group policy object, the child does not inherit any policies from a parent-level group policy object.</p>

<p><b>No Override</b></p>

<p>The No Override check box forces all child policy containers to inherit the parent's policies even if those policies conflict with the child's policies, and even if Block Inheritance has been set for the child. This check box and the check box described next are located by clicking the Options button on the GPO's Properties dialog box.</p>

<p><b>Disabled</b></p>

<p>The Disabled check box turns off the GPO so that it is removed from operation. However, it is still associated with the container where it is specified. This option is commonly used to change settings in a policy without affecting users. When the modifications are complete, clearing this check box applies the GPO to all users who are assigned the Apply Group Policy permission.</p>

<p><b>Deleting the Default Domain Policy</b></p>

<p>By default, the Default Domain Policy GPO cannot be deleted by any administrator. This is to prevent the accidental deletion of this GPO, which contains important and required settings for the domain. If the Default Domain Policy should not be applied, for example, because the policies have been set in other GPOs, select the Disable Computer Configuration settings, and the Disable User Configuration settings check boxes in the properties of the Default Domain Policy. You can also select the Block Policy Inheritance check box for a GPO lower in the hierarchy so that the Default Domain Policy does not apply. This will work as long as the parent GPO is not configured for the No Override link option.</p>

<A NAME="355"><h3>Support for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0</h3></A>
<p>The Group Policy snap-in does not provide client support for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT computers.</p>

<p>Support for Windows NT 4.0 clients is provided by fully supporting the Windows NT 4.0 style administrative templates (.adm files) and by providing the Windows NT 4.0 System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) files. Windows 95 and Windows 98 clients still need to be managed by using the Windows 9<i>x</i> System Policy Editor.</p>

<p>Client computers that are running Windows 95 and Windows 98 need to
have the Config.pol file created on the client computer's operating system copied to the domain's network logon share. Windows NT 4.0 clients use the Ntconfig.pol file, which they read from the network logon share. In a Windows NT Server network, the logon share is named Netlogon and is located in the %systemroot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts folder. The network logon share for Windows 2000 is located in the %systemroot%\SYSVOL\Sysvol\
<i>&lt;DomainName.com&gt;</i>\Scripts folder and is shared as Netlogon. Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT client computers will look to this share for their respective .pol file.</p>

<p>For information about installing the System Policy Editor, see Windows 2000 Server Help. The System Policy Editor is included with Windows 2000 Server but not with Windows 2000 Professional. The Windows 2000 Optional Administrative Tools package (Adminpak.msi), which includes the System Policy Editor, comes on the Windows 2000 Server CD-ROM for installation onto computers running Windows 2000 Professional. Adminpak.msi does not place a program item in the Administrative Tools program group. To run the Windows NT policy editor, type <b>poledit</b> in the Run dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="356"><h2>Administering Group Policies</h2></A>
<p>Once you have set up your group policy objects and, if desired, configured an MMC console that contains a Group Policy snap-in for each of the GPOs, you are ready to administer the group policies.</p>

<A NAME="357"><h3>Managing Software Settings</h3></A>
<p>Use the Group Policy snap-in to centrally manage software distribution. Software can be installed, assigned, published, updated, repaired, and uninstalled for groups of users and computers.</p>

<p>Before using the Group Policy snap-in to deploy software, Microsoft Windows Installer (.msi) packages must be acquired for the applications. Packages can be acquired in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The software vendor or developer may supply the Windows Installer packages for their applications. For example, Microsoft products will provide Windows Installer packages. Third-party software installation tool vendors will supply developers with the Windows Installer package-authoring tools for authoring or creating native Windows Installer packages for their software.</li></p>

<p><li>The administrator can use a repackaging tool to create a repackaged Windows Installer package for the application. Third-party software installation tool vendors can supply administrators with the Windows Installer repackaging tools they need to repackage their existing software.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Assigning and Publishing Applications</b></p>

<p>You can assign applications to users and computers, and you can publish applications to users.</p>

<p><b>Assigning to users</b></p>

<p>When you assign an application to a user, the application is advertised to the user the next time that user logs onto a workstation. The application advertisement follows the user regardless of which physical computer he or she actually uses. This application is installed the first time the user activates the application on the computer, either by selecting the application on the Start menu or by activating a document associated with the application.</p>

<p><b>Assigning to Computers</b></p>

<p>When you assign an application to the computer, the application is advertised and the installation is performed when it is safe to do so. Typically, this happens when the computer starts up so that there are no competing processes on the computer.</p>

<p><b>Publishing to Users</b></p>

<p>When you publish the application to users, the application does not appear installed on the users' computers. No shortcuts are visible on the desktop or Start menu, and no changes are made to the local registry on the users' computers. Instead, published applications store their advertisement attributes in the Active Directory store. Then, information such as the application's name and file associations is exposed to the users in the Active Directory container. The application is then available for the user to install by using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel or by clicking a file associated with the application (such as an .xls file for Microsoft Excel).</p>

<p><b>Assigning and Publishing Applications</b></p>

<p>To assign or publish an application, create a shared folder and copy the application files and package files (.msi files) to the shared folder. Assign the following permissions to the shared folder:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Everyone = Read</li></p>

<p><li>Administrators = Full Control</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To assign or publish an application, open the Group Policy snap-in for the appropriate GPO and select the Software Settings\Software installation subfolder from either Computer Configuration or User Configuration. From the Action menu, select New and then select Package. Browse to the network share that was created, and select the package to be assigned. The Deploy Application dialog box appears. Select the deployment method.</p>

<p>Click Assigned: Deployed To All Users At Logon, or click Published: Users Install Via Add/Remove Programs wizard, and then click OK. The name of the application to be assigned or published, along with additional properties for the application, appears in the details pane.</p>

<p>The following table describes how applications are deployed:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr>

<A NAME="358"><h3>Managing Scripts</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 group policy allows considerable flexibility when assigning scripts. You can assign startup and shutdown scripts to computers, which Windows 2000 processes when it starts up and shuts down. You can also assign logon and logoff scripts to users, which Windows 2000 processes when the user logs on and logs off.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 executes scripts in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>When you assign multiple logon and logoff or startup and shutdown scripts to a user or computer, Windows 2000 executes the scripts from top to bottom. You can determine the order of execution for multiple scripts in the Properties dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li>When a computer is shut down, Windows 2000 first processes logoff scripts and then shutdown scripts. By default, the timeout value for processing scripts is two minutes. If the logoff and shutdown scripts require more than two minutes to process, you must adjust the timeout value with a software policy.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Windows 2000 stores scripts in the Scripts folder of the GPT.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The Group Policy snap-in in Windows 2000 allows considerable flexibility when assigning scripts. Administrators can assign both startup and shutdown scripts to computers as well as logon and logoff scripts to users. Scripts are scheduled to run upon a specific event through the Scripts (Startup/Shutdown) extension for Computers and the Scripts (Logon/Logoff) extension for Users. As their names imply, the scripts process when the operating system starts up or shuts down or when the user logs on or logs off.</p>

<p>The scripts that can be used include Windows NT batch files (.bat or .cmd), VBScript (.vbs), or JScript (.js) with Windows Scripting Host.</p>

<p>To assign scripts, double-click the appropriate scripts icon (Startup, Shutdown, Logon, or Logoff) and click Add. Browse to the script you want implemented. Once the script is selected, enter any command line parameters for the script.</p>

<p><b>Multiple Scripts</b></p>

<p>Multiple Logon/Logoff or Startup/Shutdown scripts can be assigned to a user or computer. Use the Up and Down buttons in the Properties dialog box to determine the order of execution when using multiple scripts. The scripts will execute in order from top to bottom.</p>

<p><b>Show Files</b></p>

<p>Clicking the Show Files button will open a window that displays the contents of the appropriate scripts folder. This allows the scripts and associated files that exist for this GPO to be viewed.</p>

<A NAME="359"><h3>Managing Security Settings</h3></A>
<p>Computer security policy covers different areas of policy, administrative rights, and user permissions.</p>

<p>There are two types of security policies defined in Windows 2000:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Domain security policy</li></p>

<p><li>Computer security policy (also known as local policy)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A computer that is not part of a Windows 2000 domain is affected only by computer security policy. A computer that is a member of a Windows 2000 domain has the computer security policy applied first, followed by the domain security policy.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 provides the infrastructure to define and manage these security policies centrally and distribute the enforcement to all machines in the domain. The security infrastructure can be separated into a number of configurable categories:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Account Policies</b> This category allows you to configure security settings for password policy, lockout policy, and Kerberos policy in Windows 2000 domains.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Local Policies</b> This category allows you to configure security settings for audit policy, user rights assignment, and security options. Local policy allows you to configure who has local or network access to the computer and whether or how local events are audited.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Event Log</b> This category allows you to configure security settings for the Application, Security, and System event logs. You can access these logs by using the Event Viewer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Restricted Groups</b> This category allows you to configure who should and should not belong to a restricted group, as well as which groups a restricted group should belong to. These settings allow administrators to enforce security policies regarding sensitive groups, such as Enterprise Administrators or Payroll. For example, it may be decided that only Joe and Mary should be members of the Enterprise Administrators group. Restricted groups can be used to enforce that policy. If a third user is added to the group (for example, to accomplish some task in an emergency situation), the next time policy is enforced, that third user is automatically removed from the Enterprise Administrators group. Policies are reapplied every 90 minutes by default. So the third user would have Enterprise Administrator privileges for a maximum of 90 minutes.</li></p>

<p><li><b>System Services</b> This category allows you to configure the startup mode and security options (security descriptors) for system services such as network services, file and print services, telephone and fax services, Internet and intranet services, and so on.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Registry</b> This category allows you to configure security settings for registry keys including access control, audit, and ownership. When you apply security on registry keys, the Security Settings extension follows the same inheritance model as that used for all tree-structured hierarchies in Windows 2000 (such as the Active Directory store and NTFS). Microsoft recommends that you use the inheritance capabilities to specify security only at top-level objects and redefine security only for those child objects that require it. This approach greatly simplifies your security structure and reduces the administrative overhead that results from a needlessly complex access control structure.</li></p>

<p><li><b>File System</b> This category allows you to configure security settings for file-system objects, including access control, audit, and ownership.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Public Key Policies</b> This category allows you to configure encrypted data recovery agents, auto-enrollment policy, domain roots, and trusted certificate authorities.</li></p>

<p><li><b>IP Security Policies on Active Directory services</b> This category allows you to configure IP security on a network.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A set of predefined security configuration templates are stored in %systemroot%\
Security\Templates. These predefined security configurations can be used
as the basis for security settings and then edited according to your organization's needs.</p>

<p>Security configurations are stored as .inf files in a text format called the Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL). When a security configuration is assigned or edited, the configuration file is processed and the corresponding changes are made to the associated computers or user accounts.</p>

<A NAME="360"><h3>Managing Administrative Templates</h3></A>
<p>In Windows 2000, the Administrative Templates extension in the Group Policy snap-in uses an administrative template (.adm) file to specify the registry settings that can be modified through the Group Policy snap-in. Each policy lists the policy settings that are applied to the selected site, domain, or organizational unit.</p>

<p>The policies listed under Administrative Templates represent registry-based group policy settings. Administrative Templates govern a variety of behaviors for the Windows 2000 operating system and its components and applications. These settings are written to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) portion of the registry database, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The .adm file is a Unicode text file. (Unicode support for .adm files is new to Windows 2000). The file specifies a hierarchy of categories and subcategories that together define how the options are displayed. It also indicates the registry locations where changes should be made for a particular selection, specifies any options or restrictions (in values) associated with the selection, and in some cases, specifies a default value to use if a selection is activated.</p>

<p>The Explain tab of each policy's Properties page contains details on the
policy settings within the .adm file. Figure 7.16 shows the Explain tab for a System policy.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f07xx16x.htm')"> <img src="images/f07xx16.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.16</b> <i>The Explain tab for the Enable Disk Quotas system property</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>The Administrative Templates nodes of the Group Policy snap-in can be extended by using custom .adm files.</p>

<p><b>Persistent Registry Settings</b></p>

<p>Windows NT 4.0 registry settings remain in effect until they are explicitly reversed. This behavior is called &quot;tattooing.&quot; Windows 2000 registry settings, by contrast, are cleaned and rewritten each time policy changes. Be aware of this behavior if you are familiar with Windows NT 4.0 registry configuration using policies.</p>

<A NAME="361"><h3>Managing Folder Redirection</h3></A>
<p>The Folder Redirection extension allows you to redirect any of the following special folders in a user profile to an alternate location (such as a network share):</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Application Data</li></p>

<p><li>Desktop</li></p>

<p><li>My Documents</li></p>

<p><li>My Documents\My Pictures</li></p>

<p><li>Start Menu</li></p>
</ul>

<p>For example, you could redirect a user's My Documents folder to \\&lt;<i>server</i>&gt;\
&lt;<i>share</i>&gt;\%username%. By redirecting the My Documents folder, you can provide the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Ensure that users' documents are available when they roam from one computer to another.</li></p>

<p><li>Reduce the time it takes to log on to and log off from the network. In Windows NT 4.0, the My Documents folder is part of the Roaming User Profile (RUP). This means that the My Documents folder and its contents are copied back and forth between the client computer and the server when users log on and log off. Relocating the My Documents folder outside of the user profile can significantly decrease that time.</li></p>

<p><li>Store user data on the network (rather than on the local computer). The data can then be centrally managed and protected with network backup procedures and Domain Dfs.</li></p>

<p><li>Make users' network-based My Documents folder available to users when they are disconnected from the corporate network by using Offline Folder technologies.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>By default, the Folder Redirection extension is not included with the Group Policy snap-in. To use Folder Redirection, you should create an MMC console that includes a Group Policy snap-in for each GPO that you support. Where appropriate, add the Folder Redirection extension to the Group Policy snap-in.</p>

<A NAME="364"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Group policies are a set of configuration settings that apply to one or more objects in the Active Directory store. They can be used to control the work environments for users in a site, for a domain, or for users associated with
a specific OU. There are many types of group policies, including software settings, scripts, security settings, administrative templates, and folder
redirection. The group policy structure is made up of group policy objects, containers, and templates. Before you can create group policies, you must create the group policy objects. From there, you can edit group policies by using the Group Policy snap-in or manage permissions by using the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. Administering group policies includes managing software settings, scripts, security settings, administrative templates, and folder redirection.</p>

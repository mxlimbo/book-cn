<A NAME="88"><h1>Lesson 2: Installing Windows 2000 Server</h1></A>
<p>Once you have performed all the necessary steps to prepare for a Windows 2000 Server installation, you are ready to begin the Windows 2000 Setup process. This lesson focuses on performing a new installation of Windows 2000 Server. It begins with a discussion of the various installation programs and then describes the phases of the installation process.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Determine which setup program you should use to install Windows 2000 server</li></p>


<p><li>Describe the three stages of the installation process</li></p>

<p><li>Perform a new installation of Windows 2000 Server</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="89"><h2>Windows 2000 Server Setup Programs</h2></A>
<p>Regardless of which method you use to install Windows 2000 Server, you must execute either Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe. You can use the Setup.exe program to launch Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe, or you can execute Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe directly. For a clean installation on a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.<i>x</i>, run Winnt.exe from the MS-DOS command line. For a clean installation from Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT Workstation, run Winnt32.exe. For a clean installation or upgrade from Windows NT Server 3.51 or 4.0, run Winnt32.exe. Several switches can be used with Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe to customize how Windows 2000 Server is installed on your computer.</p>

<A NAME="90"><h3>Windows 2000 Setup Program</h3></A>
<p>The Windows 2000 Setup program, Setup.exe, is located in the root directory of the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM. When you execute Setup.exe, the Microsoft Windows 2000 CD screen appears. From there, you can choose to install Windows 2000 Server, install add-on components, browse the CD, or exit the Setup program. If you select the Install Windows 2000 option, the Winnt.exe or the Winnt32.exe program runs, depending on which operating system you are currently running.</p>

<p>If Autorun is enabled on your system, the Windows 2000 CD screen will appear when you insert the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Autorun calls Setup.exe, which checks the operating system. If Setup determines that the computer is running Windows NT Server 3.51, Windows NT Server 4.0, or an earlier version of Windows 2000 Server, you are prompted either to upgrade or install Windows 2000. If a newer version of Windows 2000 Server is installed on the computer, Setup.exe will not allow the installation of Windows 2000 Server to continue.</p>

<A NAME="91"><h3>Winnt.exe Setup Program</h3></A>
<p>Winnt.exe is commonly used for over-the-network installations that use an MS-DOS network client. Winnt.exe performs the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Creates a $WIN_NT$.~BT temporary directory on the system partition and copies Setup boot files into this directory.</li></p>

<p><li>Creates a $WIN_NT$.~LS temporary directory and copies the Windows 2000 files from the server into this directory.</li></p>

<p><li>Prompts users to restart their systems. After the computer restarts, the boot menu appears and installation continues.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>Winnt.exe installs Windows 2000 Server and can be executed from an MS-DOS or a Windows 16-bit operating system command prompt.</p>

<p><b>Winnt.exe Switches</b></p>

<p>You can use the following switches to modify the behavior of the Winnt.exe Setup program:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>WINNT [/s[:sourcepath]] [/t[:tempdrive]] [/u[:answer_file]]
[/udf:id[,UDF_file]][/r:folder] [/rx:folder] [/e:command] [/a]</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>These switches are described in detail in the following table:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Switch  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" nowrap>/s[:<i>sourcepath</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies the source location of the Windows 2000 files. The location must be a full path of the form x:<i>[path]</i> or a valid UNC.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/t[:<i>tempdrive</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Directs Setup to place temporary files on the specified drive and to install Windows 2000 on that drive. If you do not specify a location, Setup attempts to locate a drive for you.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" nowrap>/u[:<i>answer file</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Performs an unattended Setup using an answer file (requires /s). The answer file provides answers to some or all of the prompts that the end user normally responds to during Setup.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" nowrap>/udf:id[,<i>UDF_file</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Indicates an identifier (id) that Setup uses to specify how a Uniqueness Database File (UDF) modifies an answer file (see /u). The /udf parameter overrides values in the answer file, and the identifier determines which values in the UDF file are used. If no UDF_file is specified, Setup prompts you to insert a disk that contains the $Unique$.udb file.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/r[:<i>folder</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies an optional folder to be installed. The folder remains after Setup finishes.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/rx[:<i>folder</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies an optional folder to be copied. The folder is deleted after Setup finishes.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/e   </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies a command to be executed at the end of GUI-mode Setup.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/a   </td>
<td valign="top">Enables accessibility options.  </td></tr>
</table></p>

<A NAME="92"><h3>Winnt32.exe Setup Program</h3></A>
<p>Winnt32.exe is used to install Windows 2000 Server from an existing Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT computer. It can be executed by double-clicking Winnt32.exe in the root of the source folder (such as \i386) on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM or in a network share location for over-the-network installations. You can also execute Winnt32.exe by using the run command from the Start Menu, which allows switches to be specified. In addition, the Winnt32 command can be run from a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT (all Windows 32-bit operating systems) command prompt.</p>

<p>If the Windows 2000 Server installation is initiated over the network, Winnt32.exe creates a $WIN_NT$.~LS temporary directory and copies the Windows 2000 Server files from the server into this directory. The temporary directory is created on the first partition that is large enough, unless otherwise specified by the /t switch. This is known as the Pre-Copy Phase.</p>

<p><b>WINNT32.EXE Switches</b></p>

<p>You can use the following switches to modify the behavior of the Winnt32.exe Setup program:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>winnt32 [/s:<i>sourcepath</i>] [/tempdrive:<i>drive_letter</i>]
[/unattend[<i>num</i>]:

[/udf:id[,<i>UDF_file</i>]]
[/syspart:<i>drive_letter</i>] [/checkupgradeonly] [/cmdcons]
[/m:<i>folder_name</i>]
[/makelocalsource] [/noreboot]</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>These switches are described in detail in the following table:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Switch   </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/s:<i>sourcepath</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies the source location of the Windows 2000 files. To simultaneously copy files from multiple servers, specify multiple /s sources. If you use multiple /s switches, the first specified server must be available or Setup will fail.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/tempdrive:<i>drive_letter</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Directs Setup to place temporary files on the specified partition and to install Windows 2000 on that partition.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/Unattend or /u  </td>
<td valign="top">Upgrades your previous version of Windows 2000 in unattended Setup mode. All user settings are taken from the previous installation, so no user intervention is required during Setup. <p>Using the /unattend switch to automate Setup affirms that you have read and accepted the End-User License Agreement (EULA) for Windows 2000. Before using this switch to install Windows 2000 on behalf of an organization other than your own, you must confirm that the end user has received, read, and accepted the terms of the Windows 2000 EULA. OEMs may not specify this key on machines being sold to end users.</p> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" nowrap>/unattend[<i>num</i>][:<i>answer_file</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Performs a fresh installation in unattended Setup mode. The answer file provides Setup with your custom specifications. Num is the number of seconds between the time that Setup finishes copying the files and when it restarts your computer. You can use num on any computer running Windows NT or Windows 2000. The <i>answer_file</i> placeholder is the name of the answer file.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/copydir:<i>folder_name</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Creates an additional folder within the folder in which the Windows 2000 files are installed. For example, if the source folder contains a folder called Private_drivers that has modifications just for your site, you can type <b>/copydir:Private_drivers</b> to have Setup copy that folder to your installed Windows 2000 folder. So then the new folder location would be %systemroot%\Private_drivers. You can use /copydir to create as many additional folders as you want.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/copysource:<i>folder_name</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Creates a temporary additional folder within the folder in which the Windows 2000 files are installed. For example, if the source folder contains a folder called Private_drivers that has modifications just for your site, you can type <b>/copysource:Private_drivers</b> to have Setup copy that folder to your installed Windows 2000 folder and use its files during Setup. So then the temporary folder location would be %systemroot%\Private_drivers. Unlike the folders /copydir creates,
/copysource folders are deleted after Setup completes.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/cmd:<i>command_line</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Instructs Setup to carry out a specific command before the final phase of Setup. This would occur after your computer has restarted twice and after Setup has collected the necessary configuration information, but before Setup is complete.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/debug[<i>level</i>][:<i>filename</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Creates a debug log at the level specified, for example, /debug4:C:\
Win2000.log. The default log file is %systemroot%\Winnt32.log, with the debug level set to 2. The log levels are as follows: 0-severe errors,
1-errors, 2-warnings, 3-information, and 4-detailed information for debugging. Each level includes the levels below it.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/udf:<i>id</i>[,<i>UDF_file</i>]  </td>
<td valign="top">Indicates an identifier (<i>id</i>) that Setup uses to specify how a Uniqueness Database File (UDF) modifies an answer file (see the /unattend entry). The UDF overrides values in the answer file, and the identifier determines which values in the UDF are used. For example, /udf:RAS_user, Our_company.udb overrides settings specified for the identifier RAS_user in the Our_company.udb file. If no UDF is specified, Setup prompts the user to insert a disk that contains the $Unique$.udb file.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/syspart:<i>drive_letter</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies that you can copy Setup startup files to a hard disk, mark the disk as active, and then install the disk into another computer. When you start that computer, it automatically starts with the next phase of the Setup. You must always use the /tempdrive parameter with the /syspart parameter.  <p>The /syspart switch for Winnt32.exe runs only from a computer that already has Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, or Windows 2000 installed on it. It cannot be run from Windows 9<i>x</i>.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/checkupgradeonly  </td>
<td valign="top">Checks your computer for upgrade compatibility with Windows 2000. For Windows 95 or Windows 98 upgrades, Setup creates a report named Upgrade.txt in the Windows installation folder. For Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 upgrades, it saves the report to the Winnt32.log in the installation folder.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/cmdcons  </td>
<td valign="top">Adds a Recovery Console option to the operating system selection screen for repairing a failed installation. It is only used post-Setup.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/m:<i>folder_name</i>  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies that Setup copies replacement files from an alternate location. Instructs Setup to look in the alternate location first, and if files are present, use them instead of the files from the default location.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/makelocalsource  </td>
<td valign="top">Instructs Setup to copy all installation source files to your local hard disk. Use /makelocalsource when installing from a CD to provide installation files when the CD is not available later in the installation.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">/noreboot   </td>
<td valign="top">Instructs Setup not to restart the computer after the file copy phase of winnt32 is completed so that you can execute another command.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<A NAME="93"><h2>The Installation Process</h2></A>
<p>The Windows 2000 Server installation process includes three phases: the Pre-Copy Phase, Text mode, and GUI mode.</p>

<A NAME="94"><h3>Pre-Copy Phase</h3></A>
<p>During the Pre-Copy Phase, all of the files needed for the installation are copied to temporary directories on the local hard drive. When you use the Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe command to initiate an installation over the network, all the files needed to complete the installation are copied over the network to a temporary directory named $WIN_NT$.~LS. Setup then continues, as it would if you were performing the installation from a local drive, moving on to the Text mode phase of the installation process and then to the GUI mode phase.</p>

<p>You can choose not to create the boot floppies by selecting the check box Copy All Setup Files From The Setup CD To The Hard Drive. The check box is under the Advanced Options button. When you select this option, a $WIN_NT$.~BT directory is created on the disk. This directory contains the files that would have been on the four boot floppies.</p>

<p>While the files are being copied into the $WIN_NT$.~LS directory, Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT is still running. This means there is less down time during the upgrade.</p>

<A NAME="95"><h3>Text Mode</h3></A>
<p>In Text mode setup, Setup prompts you for information needed to complete the installation. After you accept the license agreement, you specify or create an installation partition and choose a file system. All files required for installation are copied from the temporary directory (or the CD-ROM) into the installation directory on the hard disk of the target computer.</p>

<p><b>Windows 2000 Server Licensing Agreement</b></p>

<p>The Windows 2000 Server Licensing Agreement takes up several pages. Use the Page Down key to move through the agreement, and then press F8 to agree. This appears before Text mode if you use Winnt32 or Autorun to start your setup.</p>

<p><b>Existing Installations</b></p>

<p>If Setup detects any existing Windows 2000 installations, it displays them in a list. You can select an installation and press R to repair it, or press Esc to continue.</p>

<p><b>Partitions</b></p>

<p>Setup displays all existing partitions and free space on the system. Using the Up and Down arrow keys you can select where you want to install Windows 2000 Server. At this point you can create and delete partitions. Press Enter to continue.</p>

<p><b>File Systems</b></p>

<p>Setup gives you the option of keeping the current file system intact or allows you to convert it to NTFS. If you do not want to change it, select the Leave Current File System Intact option, which is the default, and press Enter to continue.</p>

<p>Setup examines your hard disks and copies the files it needs for installation from the temporary directory to the installation directory. (Winnt is the default directory.)</p>

<A NAME="96"><h3>GUI Mode</h3></A>
<p>After completing the Text mode portion of Setup, the computer restarts and GUI mode begins. This phase allows you to select which optional components to install and allows you to select the administrator password.</p>

<p>GUI mode consists of three distinct stages:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Gathering Information About Your Computer</li></p>

<p><li>Installing Windows 2000 Server Networking</li></p>

<p><li>Completing Setup</li></p>
</ol>

<p><b>Gathering Information About Your Computer</b></p>

<p>The Gathering Information About Your Computer stage is a series of dialog boxes that Windows 2000 uses to collect configuration information for setting up your system. During this stage, Windows 2000 security features are installed and devices are installed and configured.</p>

<p><b>Regional Settings</b></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the current (default) regional settings. You can add support for additional languages, change your location settings for the system, and configure the user account default settings as well.</p>

<p><b>Personalize Your Software</b></p>

<p>When configuring your system, you must enter the name that Windows 2000 Server is registered to. In addition, you can add the name of the organization, although this is optional.</p>

<p><b>Licensing Mode</b></p>

<p>You must select the Per Server or Per Seat licensing method. If you select Per Server, you must enter the number of Per Server licenses.</p>

<p><b>Computer Name and Administrator Password</b></p>

<p>You must enter a computer name (NetBIOS name of up to 15 characters) when you install Windows 2000. Note that the autogenerated name is 15 characters long. The name you enter must be different from other computer, workgroup, or domain names on the network. A default computer name is displayed. You can access the default name or type in a computer name.</p>

<p>You can also enter an Administrator password for the local Administrator user account. This password can be up to 127 characters long, or it can be left blank.</p>

<p><b>Optional Component Manager</b></p>

<p>The Optional Component Manager allows you to add or remove additional components during and after installation. For details about each of these components, see &quot;<A HREF="ch02b.htm#65">Lesson 1: Preparing to Install Windows 2000 Server</A>.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Date and Time Settings</b></p>

<p>During the installation process, you must select the appropriate time zone and adjust the date and time settings, if necessary, including automatic adjustments for daylight savings time.</p>

<p><b>Installing Windows 2000 Server Networking</b></p>

<p>When Setup completes the Gathering Information About Your Computer stage, it returns to the Windows 2000 Setup screen. Setup then examines the computer to detect installed network adapters. This can take several minutes.</p>

<p><b>Networking Settings</b></p>

<p>The Windows 2000 networking setup begins with a dialog box offering a choice between Typical settings (default) or Custom settings. Typical settings configure the system with the all the defaults: Client for Microsoft Networks, File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks, and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) configured as a DHCP client.</p>

<p>Custom settings allows the configuration of the following three items:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Clients</b> The default client is Client For Microsoft Networks. You can add Gateway (and Client) Services for NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Services</b> The default service is File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks. You can add SAP Agent and QoS Packet Scheduler. You can modify the settings for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks by highlighting the service and clicking Properties. This allows you to optimize server service settings and provide server service compatibility for LAN Manager 2.<i>x</i> clients.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Protocols</b> The default protocol is Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). You can add additional protocols, including NWLink IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, DLC, AppleTalk, Network Monitor Driver, and others. You can also modify the settings for a protocol (if applicable) by highlighting the protocol and clicking Properties.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Completing Setup</b></p>

<p>The Completing Setup stage performs the following actions and requires no user interaction. The following table provides an overview of the tasks performed by Setup during this stage.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Task  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Copying files  </td>
<td valign="top">Setup copies any remaining files necessary to the installation directory such as accessories and bitmaps.  </td></tr>

<td valign="top">Configuring the computer  </td>
<td valign="top">Setup creates your start menu, program groups, sets up the print spooler, printers, services, the administrator account, fonts, the Pagefile, and the registration of many dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Saving the configuration   </td>
<td valign="top">Setup saves your configuration to the registry, creates the repair directory, and resets the Boot.ini.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Removing temporary files  </td>
<td valign="top">Setup removes the temporary files and directories created and used during installation, such as the $WIN_NT$.~LS directory, and also compacts the system hives in the registry.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="97"><h3>Exercise 1: Installing Windows 2000 Server</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, you install Windows 2000 Server on a computer with no formatted partitions. During installation, you use the Windows 2000 Server Setup program to create a partition on your hard disk, on which you install Windows 2000 Server as a stand-alone server in a workgroup.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Creating Windows 2000 Server Setup diskettes</b></li></p>


<p>Complete this procedure on a computer running MS-DOS or any version of Windows with access to the Bootdisk directory on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM.</p>

<p>If your computer is configured with a bootable CD-ROM drive, you can install Windows 2000 without using the Setup disks. To complete this exercise as outlined, bootable CD-ROM support must be disabled in the BIOS.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
This procedure requires four formatted 1.44-MB disks. If you use diskettes that contain data, the data will be overwritten without warning.</blockquote></div>

<A NAME="98"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>To install Windows 2000 Server, you must run either Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe. Winnt.exe is used on computers running MS-DOS or Windows 16-bit operating systems. Winnt32.exe is used on computers running Windows 32-bit operating systems (Windows 9<i>x</i>, Windows NT, or Windows 2000). You can use a number of parameters with Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe to customize how Windows 2000 Server is installed on your computer. Once one of the Setup files is launched, the Windows 2000 Server installation begins. This process includes three phases: the Pre-Copy Phase, Text mode, and GUI mode. During the Pre-Copy Phase, all of the files needed for the installation are copied to temporary directories on the local hard drive. In Text mode setup, Setup prompts the user for information needed to complete the installation. The GUI mode allows you to select which optional components to install and to select the administrator password.</p>

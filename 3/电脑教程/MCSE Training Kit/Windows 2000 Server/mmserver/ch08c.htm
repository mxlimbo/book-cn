<A NAME="375"><h1>Lesson 2: Setting Up Network Printers</h1></A>
<p>Setting up and sharing a network printer makes it possible for multiple users to print to it. You can set up a printer for a print device connected directly to the print server, or you can set up a printer for a print device connected to the print server over the network. In larger organizations, most printers point to network print devices.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the requirements for setting up a network printer and network printing resources</li></p>

<p><li>Add and share a new printer for a local print device or a network print device</li></p>


<p><li>Share an existing printer</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 35 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="376"><h2>Installing a Local Print Device</h2></A>
<p>The steps for adding a printer for a local print device or for a network print device are similar. To install a local print device, use the Add Printer wizard on the print server. When prompted, select Local Printer rather than Network Printer, as shown in Figure 8.6.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.6</b> <i>The Local Or Network Printer screen appearing in the Add Printer wizard</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>The wizard guides you through the remaining steps necessary to add a printer for a print device connected to the print server. The number of local print devices you can connect to a print server through physical ports depends on your hardware configuration.</p>

<A NAME="377"><h2>Installing a Network Print Device</h2></A>
<p>In larger companies, most print devices are network print devices. These print devices offer several advantages. You do not need to place print devices near the print server. In addition, network connections transfer data more quickly than printer cable connections.</p>

<p>You add a printer for a network print device by using the Add Printer wizard. The main difference between adding a printer for a local print device and adding a printer for a network print device is that for a typical network print device, you provide additional port and network protocol information.</p>

<p>The default network protocol for Windows 2000 is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which many network print devices use. For TCP/IP, you provide additional port information by using the Add Standard TCP/IP Printer Port wizard, which is accessed through the Add Printer wizard. See Windows 2000 Server Help for more details about installing a TCP/IP print device onto your network.</p>

<A NAME="378"><h2>Sharing an Existing Printer</h2></A>
<p>If the printing demands on your network increase and your network has an existing, unshared printer for a print device, you can share it so that users can print to the print device.</p>

<p>When you share a printer, consider the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>You need to assign the printer a share name, which appears in My Network Places. Use an intuitive name to help users when they are browsing for a printer.</li></p>

<p><li>You can add printer drivers for Windows 95, Windows 98, all versions of Windows NT, and Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>You can choose to publish the printer in Active Directory services so that users can search for the printer.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To share an existing printer, open the Printers window, open the Properties dialog box for that printer, and then select the Sharing tab (Figure 8.7). The Sharing tab provides a simple interface for sharing the printer.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.7</b> <i>The Sharing tab in the Properties dialog box for a printer</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>After you have shared the printer, Windows 2000 displays an open hand under the printer icon, indicating that the printer is shared.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1: Installing and Configuring Print Sharing and
Setting the Printer for Offline Operation</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you use the Add Printer wizard to add a local printer to your computer and share it. This exercise does not require you to have a print device because the printer will be taken offline to avoid error messages that would otherwise appear in later exercises. Complete this exercise on Server01.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Adding a local printer and configuring print sharing</b></li></p>


<ol>
<p><li>Log on to the domain as administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.</li></p>

<p>The Printers window appears. A Fax icon appears in the Printers window. During a typical installation of Windows 2000 Server, the Fax Service is installed.</p>

<p><li>Double-click Add Printer.</li></p>

<p>The Add Printer wizard appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Local Or Network Printer screen appears, and you are prompted for the location of the printer. Because you are creating the printer on the computer at which you are sitting and not on a different computer, this printer is referred to as a local printer.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Local Printer radio button is selected, clear the Automatically Detect And Install My Plug And Play Printer check box, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Select The Printer Port screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the Create A New Port radio button.</li></p>

<p>The Type drop-down list box appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the arrow to the right of the Type drop-down list box.</li></p>

<p>Notice that Local Port and Standard TCP/IP Port are the available options.</p>

<p>The port types that will be available other than local port depend on the installed network protocols. In this case, TCP/IP is installed, so this protocol-based port is available.</p>

<p><li>Click the Use The Following Port radio button, and then verify that LPT1: is highlighted.</li></p>

<p>For this exercise, assume that the print device you are adding is directly attached to your computer and using the LPT1 port.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The wizard prompts you for the printer manufacturer and model. You will add an HP LaserJet 5Si printer.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
The list of printers is sorted in alphabetical order. If you cannot find a printer name, make sure you are looking in the correct location.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="10">Under Manufacturers, click HP; under Printers, click HP LaserJet 5Si; and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Name Your Printer screen appears. In the Printer Name box, Windows 2000 defaults to the printer name HP LaserJet 5Si. For this exercise, do not change this name.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Yes radio button is selected for the Do You Want Your Windows-Based Programs To Use This Printer As The Default Printer? radio button.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Printer Sharing screen appears, prompting you for printer sharing information.</p>

<p><li>Verify that the Share As radio button is selected.</li></p>

<p>Notice that you can assign a shared printer name even though you already supplied a printer name. The shared printer name is used to identify a printer on the network and must conform to a naming convention. This shared name is different from the printer name you entered previously. The printer name is a description that will appear with the printer's icon in the Printers system folder and in Active Directory services. The share name is kept short for compatibility with other operating systems like Windows 3.<i>x</i>.</p>

<p><li>In the Share As text box, type <b>Printer1</b> and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Location And Comment screen appears.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Windows 2000 displays the values you enter for the Location and Comment text boxes when a user searches the Active Directory store for a printer. Entering this information is optional, but doing so helps users locate the printer.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="15">In the Location text box, type <b>Building 520, Floor 18, Office 1831</b>; in the Comment text box, type <b>Black and White Output Laser Printer - High Volume</b>; and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Print Test Page screen appears.</p>

<p>Notice that you can print a test page to confirm that your printer is set up properly. You can also install additional drivers for other versions of Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p><li>Click the No radio button, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Completing The Add Printer Wizard screen appears and provides a summary of your installation choices.</p>

<p><li>Confirm the summary of your installation choices, and then click Finish.</li></p>

<p>If necessary, Windows 2000 displays the Files Needed dialog box, prompting you for the location of the Windows 2000 Server distribution files.</p>

<p><li>If the Files Needed dialog box appears, insert the Windows 2000 Server Installation CD-ROM and wait for about 10 seconds. If the Files Needed dialog box doesn't appear, read the information following step 20.</li></p>

<p><li>If Windows displays the Windows 2000 CD-ROM window, close it.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK to close the Insert Disk dialog box.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 copies the printer files, and an icon for the HP LaserJet 5Si printer appears in the Printers window.</p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 displays an open hand under the printer icon. This indicates the printer is shared. Also notice the check mark next to the printer, which indicates the printer is the default printer for the print server.</p>
 
<p><li>Keep the Printers window open since you will need it to complete the next exercise.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 2: Taking a printer offline and printing a test document</b></li></p>

<p>In this exercise, you take the printer you created offline. Taking a printer offline causes documents you send to this printer to be held on the computer while the print device is unavailable. Doing this will prevent error messages about unavailable print devices from occurring in later exercises. Otherwise, Windows 2000 will display such error messages when it attempts to send documents to a print device that is not connected to the computer.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the Printers window, click the HP LaserJet 5Si icon.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the File menu, and then click Use Printer Offline.</li></p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 changes the icon to reflect that the printer is not available and the text in the left pane of the Printers window indicates the status of the printer is Use Printer Offline.</p>

<p><li>In the Printers window, double-click the HP LaserJet 5Si icon.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the list of documents to be sent to the print device is empty.</p>

<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Notepad.</li></p>

<p><li>In Notepad, type any sample text that you want.</li></p>

<p><li>Arrange Notepad and the HP LaserJet 5Si window so that you can see the contents of each.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
Access the context menu of the taskbar, and click Tile Windows
Horizontally.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="7">In Notepad, click the File menu, and then click Print.</li></p>

<p>The Print dialog box appears, allowing you to select the printer and print options.</p>

<p>The Print dialog box displays the location and comment information you entered when you created the printer, and it shows that the printer is currently offline. You can also use the Find Printer button on the dialog box to search the Active Directory store for a printer.</p>

<p>Notice that HP LaserJet 5Si is selected as the printer. This printer is automatically selected because the HP LaserJet 5Si is the default printer for the print server.</p>

<p><li>Click Print.</li></p>

<p>Notepad briefly displays a message stating that the document is printing on your computer. On a fast computer, you might not be able to see this message.</p>

<p>In the HP LaserJet 5Si - Use Printer Offline window, you will see the document waiting to be sent to the print device. The document is held in the print queue because you took the printer offline. If the printer was online, the document would be sent to the print device.</p>

<p><li>Close Notepad, and click No when prompted to save changes to your document.</li></p>

<p><li>Select the document in the HP LaserJet 5Si-Use Printer Offline window, click the Printer menu, and then click Cancel All Documents.</li></p>

<p>A Printer message box appears asking if you are sure you want to cancel all documents for HP LaserJet 5Si.</p>

<p><li>Click Yes.</li></p>

<p>The document is removed.</p>

<p><li>Close the HP LaserJet 5Si - Use Printer Offline window.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the Printers window.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="379"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The steps for adding a printer for a local print device or for a network print device are similar. In both cases, use the Add Printer wizard on the print server. The Add Printer wizard starts with the Welcome To The Add Printer Wizard screen. The wizard guides you through the steps to add a printer for a print device. The default network protocol for Windows 2000 is TCP/IP, which many network print devices use. In addition, if the printing demands on your network increase and your network has an existing, nonshared printer for a print device, you can share it so that users can print to the print device.</p>

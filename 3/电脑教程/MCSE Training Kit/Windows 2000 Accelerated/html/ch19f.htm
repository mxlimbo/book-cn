<h2><a name="1362">Performance Monitoring Tools</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 provides several tools for monitoring Active Directory performance. On the Administrative Tools menu, the Event Viewer console allows you to view log files and error messages sent by applications. The Performance console provides a graphical way to view performance of Active Directory according to measurements, or counters, that you select. The Performance console also provides a means to log activity or send alerts according to those measurements and view the logs either printed or online.</p>

<h2><a name="1363">The Event Viewer Console</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 provides the Event Viewer console as a way to monitor Windows-wide events such as application, system, and security events, and service-specific events such as directory service events. These events are recorded in event logs. For example, if you need detailed information about when directory partitions are being replicated, you would study the File Replication Service log in the Event Viewer.</p>

<p>Also, if you experience problems with Active Directory, it is recommended that the directory service event logs be the <i>first</i> item that you use to investigate the causes of the problem. By using information from the event log, you can better understand the sequence and types of events that led up to a particular performance problem.</p>

<p>Event Viewer can be used to view, locate, filter, and archive information contained in Windows 2000 security logs and to configure security logs. The procedures for each of these tasks are similar for the event logs used to monitor Active Directory performance. These logs are described in Table 19.5.</p>

<h2><a name="1364">The Performance Console</a></h2>


<p>The Performance console allows you to monitor conditions within local and remote computers anywhere in your network and to summarize performance at selected intervals. The Performance console can use various counters for monitoring real-time resource usage. It can log results into a file so that you can view and diagnose historical performance problems. With appropriate permissions, it can monitor resource usage of other computers that run server services on the network. The Performance console can also be used for collecting baseline performance data and then configured to send alerts to the Event Log or other locations about exceptions to the baseline.</p>

<p>The Performance console contains two snap-ins: System Monitor (an ActiveX control) and Performance Logs And Alerts.</p>

<h2><a name="1365">System Monitor</a></h2>


<p>With System Monitor, you can measure Active Directory performance on your own computer or other computers on a network. You can perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect and view real-time performance data on a local computer or from several remote computers</li>

<li>View data collected either currently or previously recorded in a counter log</li>

<li>Present data in a printable graph, histogram, or report view</li>

<li>Incorporate System Monitor functionality into Microsoft Word or other applications in the Microsoft Office suite by means of Automation</li>

<li>Create Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages from performance views</li>

<li>Create reusable monitoring configurations that can be installed on other computers using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)</li>
</ul>

<p>A sample System Monitor is shown in Figure 19.9.</p>

<p>You can define the Active Directory data you want to collect in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Type of data.</b> To select the data to be collected, you specify performance objects and performance counters.</li>

<li><b>Source of data.</b> System Monitor can collect data from your local computer or from other computers on the network where you have permission. (By default, administrative permission associated with the task is required.) In addition, you can include real-time data or data collected previously using counter logs.</li>

<li><b>Sampling parameters.</b> System Monitor supports manual, on-demand sampling or automatic sampling based on a time interval you specify. When viewing logged data, you can also choose starting and stopping times so that you can view data spanning a specific time range.</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
<a href="javascript:fullSize('F19cc09x.htm')"><img src="images/F19cc09.JPG" /></a>
<div class="caption"><b>Figure 19.9</b> <i>A sample System Monitor</i>
</div>
</div>

<p>In addition to options for defining data content, you have considerable flexibility in designing the appearance of your System Monitor views:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Type of display.</b> System Monitor supports chart, histogram, and report views.</li>

<li><b>Display characteristics.</b> For any of the three display types, you can define the characteristics, colors, and fonts for the display.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1366">Defining Data for Monitoring</a></h3>


<p>To begin monitoring data, you specify performance objects and performance counters. A <i>performance object</i> is a logical connection of counters that is associated with a resource or service that can be monitored. For the purposes of monitoring Active Directory, you monitor the activity of the NTDS (NT Directory Service) performance object. By using System Monitor, you can track the activity of performance objects through the use of counters. <i>Performance counters</i> refer to the multitude of conditions that can apply to a performance object. For example, if you need to find out the number of connected LDAP client sessions, you can select the LDAP Client Sessions counter under the NTDS performance object and then view the current activity by using System Monitor.</p>

<h3><a name="1367">The NTDS Performance Object Counters</a></h3>


<p>The NTDS performance object contains many performance counters that provide statistics about Active Directory performance. After determining the statistics you want to monitor, you must find the matching performance counters.</p>

<p>Performance counters can provide some baseline analysis information for capacity and performance planning. Typically, counters that are suited for capacity planning contain the word &quot;total&quot; in their name. These counters fall into three types: statistic counters, ratio counters, and accumulative counters. <i>Statistic counters</i> show totals per second. An example is DRA (Directory Replication Agent) Inbound Properties Total/Sec, which is the total number of object properties received from inbound replication partners. <i>Ratio counters</i> show percentage of total. An example is DS (Directory Service) % Writes From LDAP, which is the percentage of directory writes coming from LDAP query. <i>Accumulative counters</i> show totals since Active Directory was last started. An example is DRA Inbound Bytes Total Since Boot, which is the total number of bytes replicated in, the sum of the number of uncompressed bytes (never compressed) and the number of compressed bytes (after compression).</p>

<p>Each counter has its own guidelines and limits. The counters in Table 19.6 are of special interest for the reasons described.</p>

<td>The number of bytes received through inbound replication that were not compressed at the source&#8212; that is, from other DSAs in the same site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DRA Inbound Bytes Total/Sec</td>

<td>DRA Inbound Objects Applied/Sec</td>
<td>The rate, per second, at which replication updates are received from replication partners and applied by the local directory service. This count excludes changes that are received but not applied (for example, when the change is already present). This indicates how much replication update activity is occurring on the server as a result of changes generated on other servers.</td>

<tr>
<td>DRA Inbound Objects Filtered/Sec</td>
<td>The number of objects received per second from inbound replication partners that contained no updates that needed to be applied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DRA Inbound Object Updates Remaining in Packet</td>
<td>The number of object updates received in the current directory replication update packet that have not yet been applied to the local server. This tells you whether the monitored server is receiving changes but taking a long time applying them to the database.</td>

<td>The number of object property values received from inbound replication partners that are Distinguished Names (DNs), per second. This includes objects that reference other objects. Distinguished Names values, such as group or distribution list memberships, are more expensive to apply than other kinds of values because group or distribution list objects can include hundreds and thousands of members and therefore are much bigger than a simple object with only one or two attributes. This counter might explain why inbound changes are slow to be applied to the database.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DRA Inbound Values Total/Sec</td>
<td>The total number of object property values received from inbound replication partners per second. Each inbound object has one or more properties, and each property has zero or more values. Zero values indicate property removal.</td>

<tr>
<td>DRA Outbound Values Total/Sec</td>
<td>The number of object property values sent to outbound replication partners per second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DRA Pending Replication Synchronizations</td>

</div></blockquote>

<h2><a name="1369">Performance Logs and Alerts</a></h2>


<p>The Performance Logs And Alerts snap-in enables you to create counter logs, trace logs, and system alerts automatically from local or remote computers.</p>

<h3><a name="1370">Counter Logs</a></h3>


<p>Counter logs, which are similar to System Monitor, support the definition of performance objects and performance counters and setting sampling intervals for monitoring data about hardware resources and system services. Counter logs collect performance counter data in a comma-separated or tab-separated format for easy import to spreadsheet or database programs. You can view logged counter data using System Monitor or export the data to a file for analysis and report generation.</p>

<h3><a name="1371">Trace Logs</a></h3>


<p>Using the default system data provider or another nonsystem provider, trace logs record data when certain activities such as a disk I/O operation or a page fault occur. When the event occurs, the provider sends the data to the Performance Logs and Alerts service. This differs from the operation of counter logs; when counter logs are in use, the service obtains data from the system when the update interval has elapsed, rather than waiting for a specific event.</p>

<p>Active Directory nonsystem providers include those for NetLogon, the Kerberos protocol, SAM, and Windows NT Active Directory Service. These providers generate trace log files containing messages that may be used to track the operations performed.</p>

<p>A parsing tool is required to interpret the trace log output. Developers can create such a tool using APIs provided on the Microsoft Developer Web site (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_window2"><i>http://msdn.microsoft.com/</i></a>).</p>

<h3><a name="1372">Logging Options</a></h3>


<p>For both counter and trace logs you can</p>

<ul>
<li>Define start and stop times, filenames, file types, file sizes, and other parameters for automatic log generation and manage multiple logging sessions from a single console window.</li>

<li>Start and stop logging either manually on demand or automatically based on a user-defined schedule.</li>

<li>Configure additional settings for automatic logging, such as automatic file renaming, and set parameters for stopping and starting a log based on the elapsed time or the file size.</li>

<li>Define a program that runs when a log is stopped.</li>

<li>View logs during collection as well as after collection has stopped. Because logging runs as a service, data collection occurs regardless of whether any user is logged on to the computer being monitored.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1373">Counter and Trace Logging Requirements</a></h3>


<p>To create or modify a log, you must have Full Control permission for the following registry key, which controls the Performance Logs and Alerts service:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonLog\Log Queries</pre>
</div>

<p>Administrators usually have this permission by default. Administrators can grant permission to users by using the Security menu in REGEDT32.EXE.</p>

<p>To run the Performance Logs and Alerts service (which runs in the background when you configure a log), you must have permission to start or otherwise configure services on the system. Administrators have this right by default and can grant it to users by using group policy. To log data on a remote computer, the Performance Logs and Alerts service must run under an account that has access to the remote system.</p>

<h3><a name="1374">Creating a Counter Log</a></h3>


<p>To create a counter log, you first define the counters you want to log and then set log file and scheduling parameters.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to create a counter log:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>From the Start menu, select Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Performance.</li>

<li>Double-click Performance Logs And Alerts, and then click Counter Logs.

<h3><a name="1376">Alerts</a></h3>


<p>Alerts, which are similar to System Monitor and counter logs, support the use of performance objects and performance counters and setting sampling intervals for monitoring data about hardware resources and system services. Using this data, you can create an alert for a counter, which logs an entry in the application event log, sends a network message to a computer, starts a performance data log, or runs a program when the selected counter's value exceeds or falls below a specified setting.</p>

<p>You can start or stop an alert scan either manually on demand or automatically based on a user-defined schedule.</p>

<h3><a name="1377">Creating an Alert</a></h3>


<p>To create an alert, you first define the counters you want to monitor for the alert and then set alert triggering and scheduling parameters.</p>

<h2><a name="1382">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson, you learned about the Active Directory performance monitoring tools, the Event Viewer console, and the Performance console.</p>

<p>The Event Viewer console is a tool to monitor events such as application or system errors or the successful starting of a service. If you experience problems with Active Directory, it is recommended that the directory service event logs be the first item that you use to investigate the causes of the problem.</p>

<p>The Performance console allows you to monitor conditions within local and remote computers anywhere in your network and to summarize performance at selected intervals. The Performance console contains two snap-ins: System Monitor (an ActiveX control) and Performance Logs And Alerts. With System Monitor, you can measure Active Directory performance on your own computer or other computers on a network. The Performance Logs And Alerts snap-in enables you to create counter logs, trace logs, and system alerts automatically from local or remote computers.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you monitored specified performance counters using System Monitor. Then you used Performance Logs And Alerts to create a counter log and an alert for the LDAP Searches/Sec counter.</p>

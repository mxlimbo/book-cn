<h1>About This Book</h1>

<p>Welcome to <i>MCSE Training Kit&#8212;Microsoft Windows 2000
Accelerated</i>. This kit presents information about the Microsoft
Windows 2000 family of products and prepares you to install, configure,
administer, and support Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. This kit introduces the various tools
for administering and configuring Windows 2000 including the Microsoft
Management Console, Task Scheduler, Active Directory service, network
protocols, and many other topics.</p>

<p>However, this kit does assume you meet certain minimum
prerequisites. This book is designed for use by seasoned Microsoft
Windows NT 4 professionals. As such, certain topics; like NTFS
permissions, domains, trust relationships, and so on are not covered in
any detail. What is covered is the knowledge and skills a Windows NT 4
professional needs to implement and support a computer network for an
enterprise-size company.</p>

<p>This book is divided into parts that loosely relate to the four
parts of the 70-240, Microsoft Windows 2000 Accelerated Exam for MCPs
Certified on Microsoft Windows NT 4 certification exam. However, while
this training kit is organized around the exam objectives, there is no
guarantee that the exam will present questions in this sequence. In
fact, the questions for the exam will be displayed randomly from across
all four sections.</p>

<p>The parts are divided into chapters. Each chapter in this book is
divided into lessons. Some of the lessons include hands-on procedures
that allow you to practice or demonstrate a particular concept or
skill. Each lesson ends with a short summary and each chapter ends with
a set of review questions to test your knowledge of the chapter
material.</p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="abouti.htm#61">Getting Started</a>&quot; section of this chapter provides
important setup instructions that describe the hardware and software
requirements to complete the procedures in this course. It also
provides information about the networking configuration necessary to
complete some of the hands-on procedures. Read through this section
thoroughly before you start the lessons.</p>

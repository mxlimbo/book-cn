Distributed File System and the File Replication Service. Dfs allows
system administrators to make it easier for users to access and manage
files that are physically distributed across a network. With Dfs, you
can make files distributed across multiple servers appear to users as
if they reside in one place on the network. Users no longer need to
know and specify the actual physical location of files in order to
access them. Dfs uses FRS to automatically synchronize content between
assigned replicas. The Microsoft Active Directory Sites And Services
snap-in uses FRS to replicate topology and global catalog information
across domain controllers.</li>

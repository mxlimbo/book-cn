<h2><a name="273">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>As an experienced Windows NT 4.0 professional, you should already be familiar with managing files, folders, and printers. This chapter presents an overview of Microsoft Windows 2000's New Technology File System (NTFS) folder and file permissions and how it is used in a Windows 2000 Professional environment.</p>

<p>In this chapter you learn how to assign NTFS folder and file permissions to user accounts and groups, and you will see how moving or copying files and folders affects NTFS file and folder permissions. The chapter also discusses how to troubleshoot common resource access problems.</p>

<p>The chapter then explains how to use NTFS compressions to better manage the space on a computer.</p>

<p>Once you understand how to manage permissions, you are introduced to sharing folders and using both shared folder and NTFS permissions to control access to folders.</p>

<p>The chapter then moves onto a discussion of another common shared resource: the printer. You are introduced to setting up and configuring printers so users can print over a network. You then are shown how to manage printers and documents from a remote location and how to administer a printer using a web browser.</p>

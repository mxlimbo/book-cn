<h1><a name="2">Prerequisites</a></h1>

<p>This book is designed for seasoned Windows NT 4 professionals who
want to prepare for the 70-240, Microsoft Windows 2000 Accelerated Exam
for MCPs Certified on Microsoft Windows NT 4 certification exam. Before
you can attempt the 70-240 exam, you must have already passed three
Windows NT 4 certification exams (70-067, 70-068, and 70-073). This
book assumes that you have the skills and knowledge listed in the
following objectives and therefore content may not be presented on
these skills. For example, NTFS permissions are basically the same in
Windows 2000 as they were in Windows NT 4. For that reason, this book
will not fully explain NTFS permissions. NTFS information is limited to
what makes sense for the flow and presentation of content in the
appropriate chapters. There are other content areas, such as domains,
trust relationships, and so on, that will not be covered because they
will be assumed as prerequisite knowledge for anyone qualified to take
the 70-240 exam.</p>

<p>The following objectives list the skills and knowledge you must have
before attempting to prepare for the 70-240 exam.</p>

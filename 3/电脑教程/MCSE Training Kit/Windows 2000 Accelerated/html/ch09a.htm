<h2><a name="664">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>Network protocols allow various computers to communicate with each other on a specificed network. There are many different network protocols supported by Windows 2000. This chapter starts with an overview of Internet Protocol (IP) routing, and then looks at the three most common protocols: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol (NWLink), and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). TCP/IP is currently the most common protocol used. It is the default protocol for virtually any internet application. It is also the default protocol supported by Windows 2000 Server. NWLink allows computers to communicate on a network requiring an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. IPX/SPX is typically used on a Novell NetWare local area network (LAN). NWLink allows you to interoperate with NetWare networks. IPSec is a new protocol. It has built-in security features that may make it the protocol of the future for internet applications.</p>

<p>As a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation professional, you should be familiar with TCP/IP and NWLink. This chapter reviews these protocols and then discusses IPSec in depth. The chapter concludes with a discussion on how to monitor network security.</p>

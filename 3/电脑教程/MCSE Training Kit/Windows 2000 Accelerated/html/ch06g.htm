<h1><a name="514">Lesson 6: Using the Recovery Console</a></h1>


<p>If changes to the system have resulted in the system not operating properly, and you have tried the Last Known Good configuration but still have problems, you may still be able to solve the problem by using the Windows 2000 Recovery Console. The Windows 2000 Recovery Console is a command-line interface you can use to perform a variety of troubleshooting and recovery tasks, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting and stopping services</li>
<li>Reading and writing data on a local drive (including drives that are formatted with the NTFS file system)</li>
<li>Formatting hard disks</li>
</ul>


<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Install and use the Recovery Console</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="515">Installing and Starting the Recovery Console</a></h2>


<p>To install the Recovery Console, insert the Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive, and close the Microsoft Windows 2000 CD dialog box, if it opens. Open the Run dialog box or a Command Prompt window in Windows 2000, change to the i386 folder on the Windows 2000 CD-ROM, and then run the winnt32 command with the /cmdcons switch. After you install the Recovery Console, you can access it from the Please Select Operating System To Start menu. You can also use the Windows 2000 Setup disks or the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM to start your computer and then select the Recovery Console option, when you are prompted to choose repair options, to access the Recovery Console.</p>

<p>After you start the Recovery Console, you must specify which installation of Windows 2000 you want to log on to (if you have a dual boot or multiple boot configuration), and then you must log on as Administrator.</p>

<h2><a name="516">Using the Windows 2000 Recovery Console</a></h2>


<p>You can also run the Recovery Console from the Windows 2000 installation CD-ROM. The Recovery Console provides you with a limited set of administrative commands that you can use to repair your Windows 2000 installation.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to start the Recovery Console from a Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Insert the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive and restart the computer. If your computer or the workstation you want to repair does not have a bootable CD-ROM drive, you will need to insert your Windows 2000 Setup Boot disk into your floppy disk drive, and then insert the additional Windows 2000 Setup disks when you are prompted to do so.</li>
<li>When Setup displays the Setup Notification message, read it, and then press Enter to continue.
<p>Setup displays the Welcome To Setup screen. Notice that, in addition to the initial installation of Windows 2000, you can use Windows 2000 Setup to repair or recover a damaged Windows 2000 installation.</p></li>
<li>Press R to repair a Windows 2000 installation.
<p>The Windows 2000 Repair Options screen appears. Notice that you can repair a Windows 2000 installation using the Recovery Console or the Emergency Repair Process.</p></li>
<li>Press C to start the Recovery Console.
<p>If you have more than one installation of Windows 2000 on the computer, you will be prompted to select which installation you want to repair.</p></li>
<li>Type <b>1</b> and then press Enter.
<p>You are prompted to enter the Administrator's password.</p></li>
<li>Type the Administrator password and then press Enter.
<p>A command prompt appears.</p></li>
<li>Type <b>Help</b> and press Enter for a list of the commands available.</li>
<li>When you have completed the repair process, type <b>exit</b> and press Enter.
<p>The computer will restart.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="518">Practice: Troubleshooting with the Windows 2000 Recovery Console</a></h2>


<p>In this practice you use the Windows 2000 Recovery Console to troubleshoot a Windows 2000 installation that will not boot. You also install and start the Recovery Console, and you will look at Help to determine the commands available in the Recovery Console. You also use the Listsvc command to view the services and then use the Disable command to disable the Alerter service.</p>

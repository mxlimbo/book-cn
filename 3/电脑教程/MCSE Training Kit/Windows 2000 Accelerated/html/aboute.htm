<h1><a name="27">Features of This Book</a></h1>

<p>Each chapter opens with a &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section,
which prepares you for completing the chapter.</p>

<p>The chapters are then broken into lessons. Whenever possible,
lessons contain practices that give you an opportunity to use the
skills being presented or explore the part of the application being
described. All practices offer step-by-step procedures that are
identified with a bullet symbol like the one to the left of this
paragraph.</p>

<p>The &quot;Review&quot; section at the end of the chapter allows you
to test what you have learned in the chapter's lessons. Appendix A,
&quot;Questions and Answers,&quot; contains all of the book's
questions and corresponding answers.</p>

<h3><a name="28">Notes</a></h3>

<p>Several types of notes appear throughout the lessons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Notes marked <b>Tip</b> contain explanations of possible results
or alternative methods.</li>

essential to completing a task.</li>

<li>Notes marked <b>Note</b> contain supplemental information.</li>

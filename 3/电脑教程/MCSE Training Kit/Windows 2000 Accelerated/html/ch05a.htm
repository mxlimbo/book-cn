<h1><a name="420">Managing Network Protocols and Services </a></h1>



<h2><a name="421">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>A <i>protocol</i> is a set of rules and conventions for sending information over a network. The network protocol Microsoft Windows 2000 relies on most commonly is TCP/IP. TCP/IP is an industry-standard suite of protocols that enables enterprise networking and connectivity on Windows 2000-based computers. TCP/IP is used for logon, file and print services, replication of information between one domain controller and another, and other common functions.</p>

<p>This chapter presents the skills and knowledge necessary to configure and install TCP/IP (these are the same skills used to to install other network protocols, including NWLink, NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI), and Data Link Control (DLC). The chapter then moves into a discussion of configuring inbound and outbound connections using either dial-up or virtual private network connections.</p>

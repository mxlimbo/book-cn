<h1><a name="640">Lesson 4: Preparing for an Unattended Installation of Windows 2000 Server</a></h1>


<p>When you perform an unattended installation of Windows 2000 Server, you create an answer file that supplies information to the setup routine. In addition, if you are going to install Windows 2000 Server on multiple computers over a network, you must create at least one set of distribution folders. This lesson describes the process of creating an answer file and setting up the distribution files necessary for a network installation.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a customized answer file for an unattended installation</li>
<li>Set up your distribution directory for a network installation of Windows 2000 Server</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b> </p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="641">Creating the Answer File</a></h2>


<p>The answer file is a customized script (usually saved as a .txt file) that allows you to run an unattended installation of Windows 2000 Server. The file, sometimes called the unattend file or the unattend script file, answers the questions that Setup normally prompts you for during installation. The \i386 directory of the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM contains a sample answer file, Unattend.txt, which you can edit and use in your unattended installation. You can leave the name of the answer file as is, or you can change it according to the needs of your organization. For example, Comp1.txt, Install.txt, and Setup.txt are all valid names for an answer file, as long as those names are correctly specified in the Setup command. Being able to use different names allows you to build and use multiple answer files if you need to maintain different scripted installations for different parts of your organization.</p>

<p>Note that other programs, such as the Sysprep tool, which is used to facilitate the creation of a disk image of your Windows 2000 Server installation, also use answer files. Table 8.14 describes how the answer file can be named and when it is used.</p>


<p><b>Table  8.14 </b> <i> Appropriate Names for Answer File</i></p>
<table>
<tr><th>Filename</th> <th>When the file is used</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>.txt</td> <td>When performing an unattended installation. You can use any name for the .txt file. Unattend.txt is the name of the sample answer file included with Windows 2000 Server.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Winnt.sif</td> <td>When installing Windows 2000 Server from a bootable CD-ROM drive.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Sysprep.inf</td> <td>When using the Sysprep tool to create a disk image of your Windows 2000 Server installation.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The same format that is used in Unattend.txt is used for the answer files listed in Table 8.14. The answer file contains multiple optional sections that you modify to supply information about your installation requirements. The file supplies Setup with answers to all the questions you are asked when you install Windows 2000 Server manually. In addition, the answer file tells Setup how to interact with the distribution folders and files that you have created. For example, in the [Unattended] section there is an OEM Preinstall entry that tells Setup whether to copy the $OEM$ subfolders from the distribution folders to the target computer.</p>

<h3><a name="642">Answer File Format</a></h3>


<p>An answer file consists of section headers, keys, and the values for each key. Most of the section headers are predefined, but some can be user defined. The following information is included in the Unattend.txt file. You can copy this file from the CD-ROM to writeable media, like a fixed disk, and then edit the file as necessary to meet the needs of your unattended installation. You can also rename the file.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>You do not need to specify all the possible keys in an answer file if the installation does not require them. Invalid key values generate errors or can cause incorrect behavior after setup.</p>

<p>The answer file is broken into sections. A section name is enclosed in brackets, as in the following example:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
[UserData]
</pre>
</div>

<p>Sections contain keys and the corresponding values for those keys. Each key and value are separated by a space, an equal sign, and a space:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
BitsPerPel = 8
</pre>
</div>

<p>Values that have spaces in them require double quotes around them:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
OrgName = &quot;Microsoft Corporation&quot;
</pre>
</div>

<p>Some sections have no keys and merely contain a list of values:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
[OEMBootFiles]

</pre></div>

<p>Comment lines start with a semicolon:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
;Setup program runs without requiring user input.
</pre>
</div>

<h3><a name="642a">Answer File Keys and Values</a></h3>

<p>Every key in an answer file must have a value assigned to it; however, some keys are optional, and some keys have default values that are used if the key is omitted. Key values are strings of text, unless a numeric string is specified. If a numeric string is specified, the value is decimal unless otherwise noted.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
Keys are not case sensitive; they can be uppercase or lowercase.
</div></blockquote>

<p>The Unattend.doc file has detailed information about the answer file keys and values. You can find Unattend.doc in the Deploy.cab file on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM, under the \Support\Tools folder. To extract or view the contents of the Deploy.cab file, use Windows Explorer. For more details about opening the Unattend.doc file, see the Sreadme.doc file on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM.</p>

<blockquote><div class="caution"><b>IMPORTANT</b> <hr />
Running Setup.exe or 2000rkst.msi from the \Support\Tools folder installs the Windows 2000 Support Tools in Support.cab, but it does not extract the Unattend.doc file or any of the other compressed files in Deploy.cab.
</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="643">Methods for Creating an Answer File</a></h3>


<p>You can create an answer file by using Setup Manager or by creating the 
file manually.</p>

<h3><a name="643a">Creating the Answer File by Using Setup Manager</a></h3>

<p>To help you create or modify the answer file, an application called Setup Manager is available on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM in the Support\Tools\Deploy.cab file.</p>

<p>You can use Setup Manager to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specify the platform for the answer file (Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Remote Operating System Installation, or Sysprep)</li>

<li>Specify the level of automation for Unattended Setup mode (Provide Defaults, Fully Automated, Hide Pages, Read Only, and GUI mode attended Setup)</li>

<li>Specify default user name and organization information</li>

<li>Define one computer name or many computer names to support multiple unattended installations</li>

<li>Configure up to 99 automatic administrator logons to complete setup</li>

<li>Configure display settings</li>

<li>Configure network settings</li>

<li>Configure joining a workgroup or domain and automatically add a computer account to the domain</li>

<li>Create distribution folders</li>

<li>Add a custom logo and background files</li>

<li>Add files to the distribution folders</li>

<li>Add commands to the <code>[GuiRunOnce]</code> section of the answer file</li>

<li>Create Cmdlines.txt files</li>

<li>Specify code pages and other language-specific settings</li>

<li>Specify regional settings</li>

<li>Specify a time zone</li>

<li>Specify Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) information</li>

<li>Customize browser and shell settings</li>

<li>Define the installation folder name. The boot partition (the partition containing the operating system files) is specified with the /t: or /tempdrive: switch</li>

<li>Add printers</li>

<li>Add mass storage device drivers and a custom HAL to be used during an unattended installation</li>

<li>Create a distribution folder and share for the distribution or specify that the unattended installation will run from the Windows 2000 Server CD-ROM</li>
</ul>

<p>With Setup Manager, you can add consistency to the process of creating or updating the answer file. However, you cannot use Setup Manager to specify all answer file settings, optional components, create Txtsetup.oem files, or create subfolders in the distribution folder.</p>

<p>After you use Setup Manager to create an answer file, add more settings by using a text editor. Refer to Unattend.doc and Readme.txt included in the Deploy.cab for a comprehensive list of available settings.</p>

<p>Table 8.15 describes the most commonly used Setup Manager specifications.</p>

<p><b>Table  8.15 </b> <i> Common Setup Manager Specifications</i></p>

<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th> <th>Purpose</th></tr>

<tr><td>Upgrade option</td> <td>Specifies whether to install Windows 2000 Professional or Windows 2000 Server</td></tr>

</table>

<h3><a name="643b">Creating the Answer File Manually</a></h3>

<p>To create the answer file manually, you can use a text editor such as Notepad. In general, an answer file consists of section headers, parameters, and values for those parameters. Although most of the section headers are predefined, you can also define additional section headers. Note that it is not necessary to specify all the possible parameters in the answer file if the installation does not require them.</p>

<h2><a name="644">Creating the Distribution Folders</a></h2>


<p>To install Windows 2000 Server on multiple computers over a network, you must create at least one set of distribution folders. The distribution folders typically reside on a server to which the destination computers can connect. This allows users to install Windows 2000 Server by running Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe on those computers. You can use one set of distribution folders and multiple answer files for different system implementations. Even if you intend to use disk imaging as your installation method, starting with distribution folders helps to provide consistent implementations for a variety of system types. In addition, distribution folders allow you to update future images by editing the files in the distribution folders to generate updated images without having to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>To help load balance the servers and to make the file-copy process of Windows 2000 Setup faster, you can create distribution folders on multiple servers to support the installation process on computers that are running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000. You can run Winnt32.exe with up to eight sets of distribution folders. Each set of distribution folders contains the Windows 2000 Server installation files as well as any device drivers and other files needed for installation.</p>

<p>To create a distribution folder manually, connect to the network server on which you want to create the distribution folder, and create a \W2kdist folder on the network share. To help differentiate between multiple distribution shares for the different editions of Windows 2000 (Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server), choose different names for each folder. If you need localized language versions of Windows 2000 to meet requirements for international branches of your organization, you can create separate distribution shares for each localized version. For each edition of Windows 2000, copy the contents of the \i386 folder to the distribution share created for it. For instance, if you are preparing a distribution for Windows 2000 Server, create and share a folder named \W2kdists and copy the \i386 directory on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM to the folder.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
The distribution share to support a default installation of Windows 2000 Server requires approximately 313 megabytes (MB) of disk space.
</div></blockquote>

<p>You can also use Setup Manager to automatically create and share a distribution folder.</p>

<h3><a name="645">Structuring the Distribution Folder</a></h3>


<p>The distribution folder (usually called i386 for Intel systems) consists of various folders and subfolders of information used during the installation of Windows 2000 Server. This folder needs to be organized in the appropriate order. Figure 8.3 illustrates how these folders should be structured.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/F08cc03.JPG" />
<div class="caption"><b>Figure 8.3</b>  <i>Example of a structure for the distribution folders</i>
</div>
</div>


<h3><a name="645a">\i386 (On Windows 2000 Installation CD-ROM Copied to Distribution Share)</a></h3>

<p>This is the primary distribution folder. It contains all the files required to install Windows 2000 Server. You copy the contents of this folder from the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM to the root of the distribution share.</p>

<h3><a name="645b">\$OEM$ (On Distribution Share and Copied to $WIN_NT$.~LS)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$ subfolder is located directly beneath the primary distribution folder. During Setup you can automatically copy directories, standard Microsoft format 8.3 files, and any tools needed for your automated installation process to \$OEM$. Note that if you use the OEMFILESPATH key in the answer file, you can create the \$OEM$ subfolder outside of the distribution folder.</p>

<p>\$OEM$ provides the necessary folder structure for supplemental files to be copied to the target computer during setup. These files include drivers, utilities, applications, and any other files required to deploy Windows 2000 Server within your organization.</p>

<p>\$OEM$ can contain the optional file Cmdlines.txt, which contains a list 
of commands to be run during the Setup wizard of setup. These commands can be used to install optional components, such as tools and utilities. 
Commands contained in Cmdlines.txt are run before the computer is 
logged on to the network.</p>

<p>As long as Setup finds \$OEM$ in the root of the distribution point, it copies all the files found in this directory to the $WIN_NT$.~LS temporary directory created during the completing phase of setup. During completing phase, subfolders of \$OEM$ are copied to the corresponding location on the target computer. At setup completion, $OEM$ and all subfolders are deleted along with $WIN_NT$.~LS.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
All folders described next are located on the distribution share below \$OEM$ and are copied to various locations on the computer running Setup.
</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="645c">\$OEM$\textmode (Copied to $WIN_NT$.~BT)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$\textmode subfolder contains new or updated files for installing mass storage device drivers and HALs. These files can include oem HALs, drivers for SCSI devices, and the Txtsetup.oem file, which directs the loading and installing of these components.</p>

<p>All files placed in the \$OEM$\textmode subfolder (HALs and drivers) must be listed in the [OEMBootFiles] section of the answer file.</p>

<h3><a name="645d">\$OEM$\$$ (Copied to %windir% and Subfolders of %windir%)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$\$$ subfolder corresponds to the contents of the %windir% environment variable. The subfolder contains the operating system files (either new files or replacements for retail files) that are copied to the 
various subfolders when Windows 2000 is installed. The structure of this subfolder must match the structure of a standard Windows 2000 installation, where \$OEM$\$$ matches %windir%, \$OEM$\$$\System32 matches %windir%\System32, and so on. Each subfolder must contain the files 
that will be copied to the corresponding operating system folder on the 
target computer.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
In Windows 2000, %systemroot% is equivalent to %windir%.
</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="645e">\$OEM$\$1 (Copied to $systemdrive$)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$\$1 subfolder, which is new for Windows 2000, corresponds to the drive on which Windows 2000 is installed. $1 is equivalent to the %systemdrive% environment variable. For example, if you are installing Windows 2000 on the D: drive, \$OEM$\$1 corresponds to the D: drive. This makes it possible to install Windows 2000 to drives other than the C: drive.</p>

<h3><a name="645f">\$OEM$\$1\Drivers (Copied to $systemdrive$\Drivers and Subfolders of $systemdrive$\Drivers)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$\$1\Drivers subfolder, which is new for Windows 2000, allows you to place new or updated Plug and Play device drivers and their supporting files (catalog files and .inf installation files) in and below the Drivers subfolder. These folders and their contents are copied to the %systemdrive%\ 
Drivers folder on the target computer. Adding the OemPnPDriversPath parameter to your answer file will tell Windows 2000 where to look for the new or updated Plug and Play drivers. When searching for appropriate Plug and Play device drivers to install during setup or afterward, Windows 2000 looks at the files in the folders you created as well as those originally included with the system. Note that you can replace Drivers with a name of your own choosing that follows the 8.3 MS-DOS naming convention.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
The \$OEM$\$1\Drivers subfolder replaces the \Display and \Net subfolders used in Windows NT installation.
</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="645g">\$OEM$\$1\Sysprep (Copied to %systemdrive%\Sysprep)</a></h3>

<p>The \$OEM$\$1\Sysprep subfolder contains the files needed to run the Sysprep utility. Sysprep.exe and Sysprepcl.exe must be in %systemdrive%\Sysprep folder for Sysprep to function properly.</p>

<blockquote><div class="tip"><b>TIP</b> <hr />
Add Sysprep.inf (created by Setup Manager or written manually) to the \$OEM$\$1\Sysprep directory on the distribution share. Otherwise, a floppy disk containing the Sysprep.inf file is necessary to complete a Sysprep setup.
</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="645h">\$OEM$\<i>drive_letter</i></a></h3>

<p>During the Text-mode portion of setup, the structure of each \$OEM$\<i>drive_letter</i> subfolder is copied to the root of the corresponding drive in the target computer. For example, files that you place in the \$OEM$\D subfolder are copied to the root of the D: drive. You can also create subfolders within these subfolders. For example, \$OEM$\E\Misc causes Setup to create a \Misc subfolder on the E: drive.</p>

<p>Files that have to be renamed must be listed in the $$Rename.txt file. Note that the files in the distribution folders must have short file names (format 8.3).</p>

<p><img src="images/practice.jpg" /></p>
<h2><a name="646">Practice: Preparing and Running an Automated Installation</a></h2>


<p>In this exercise, you create and run an automated installation of Windows 2000 Server on Computer 2. To prepare for the automated installation, you use the Windows 2000 Server Setup Manager to create an answer file and a distribution share on Server01.</p>

<h3><a name="649">Exercise 3: Running an Unattended Setup of  Windows 2000 Server from Computer 2</a></h3>


<p>Computer 2 must already be running a Windows 32-bit operating system, such as Windows 95 or Windows NT. In addition, Server01 must be connected to the same network as Computer 2. All requirements for the exercises are outlined in &quot;<a href="abouta.htm">About This Book</a>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><div class="caution"><b>CAUTION</b> <hr />
If Computer 2 is running Windows NT, the boot partition is C:\ and the operating system directory is Winnt, change the name of the installation directory in Unattend.txt. The directory name listed in Unattend.txt is found under the Unattended section, and the valuename is TargetPath. For example, change the value so that TargetPath=\WIN2000S.
</div></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>From Computer 2, connect a drive letter (H: will be used throughout this exercise), to \\Server01\Win2000dist. You can connect to Server01 by using the Administrator username and the password of &quot;password.&quot;

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
If you are running Windows 95 or Windows 98 and are having 
trouble connecting to Server01, make sure the computer is a member of WORKGROUP and logon as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;
</div></blockquote></li>

<li>Open a command prompt and type <b>cdh:</b>.

<blockquote><div class="caution"><b>CAUTION</b> <hr />
If you have upgraded from Windows 95 or Windows 98, you might find that Setup can't find the .udf file. If this happens, open Unattend.txt on Server01 and specify the full path to the .udf file.
</div></blockquote></li>

<li>From the command prompt, type <b>H:\Unattend</b>  <b>Server02</b>.</li>

<li>The Copying Installation Files screen appears as Windows 2000 Server runs an automated installation over the network.
<p>At the conclusion of this phase, a warning screen will inform you that the computer will be restarted.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b> <hr />
This pre-Text-mode phase of setup can be completed using the \syspart switch with Winnt32.exe.
</div></blockquote></li>

<li>Allow the computer to restart.
<p>Upon reboot, the Windows 2000 boot menu appears and Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Setup continues to Text mode.</p>

<p>The computer reboots again, and the boot menu appears showing Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 installation continues the Graphics-mode portion of setup. The Installing Devices And Installing Components screens take time to complete. The Performing Final Tasks screen appears as Windows 2000 Server completes the setup routine. When setup is completed, the Windows 2000 Setup screen announces that the computer will restart.</p></li>

<li>After the computer restarts, notice that it automatically logs on as Administrator as specified in Setup Manager. The printer is installed and Notepad.exe runs.</li>

<li>Close Notepad.
<p>The Windows 2000 Configure Your Server screen appears.</p></li>

<li>Select the I Will Configure This Server Later radio button, and click Next.
<p>The Configure Your Server screen appears.</p></li>

<li>Clear the Show This Screen At Startup check box, and close the screen.
<blockquote><div class="caution"><b>CAUTION</b> <hr />
If you are upgrading from Windows 95 or Windows 98, check to see if your partition is NTFS. If not, you must convert it. You can do this by typing <b>convert c: /fs:ntfs</b>  at the command prompt.
</div></blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="650">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>Before you can perform an unattended installation of Windows 2000 Server, you must create an answer file, which is a customized script file that contains multiple optional sections that you modify to supply information about your installation requirements. The file supplies Setup with answers to all the questions you are asked when you install Windows 2000 Server manually. In addition, the answer file tells Setup how to interact with the distribution folders and files that you have created. You must create at least one set of distribution folders to install Windows 2000 Server over a network. Use Setup Manager to create a distribution folder and an answer file manually or automatically. To further customize the answer file, refer to the Unattend.doc file located on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM.</p>

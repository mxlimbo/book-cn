<h2><a name="579">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>This chapter discusses the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server installation process. It outlines the type of information you should gather to prepare for your installation and describes the steps you should take before you begin. The chapter then takes you through the phases of a normal installation and continues with a discussion of upgrading to Windows 2000 Server. This is followed by a lesson on troubleshooting installation problems.</p>

<p>The chapter concludes with a discussion of the various ways you can automate the installation process.</p>

<p>To complete all of the exercises in this chapter, you must have</p>

<ul>
<li>Two computers that meet the minimum hardware requirements listed in &quot;<a href="abouti.htm#62">Hardware Requirements</a>.&quot; One of them (Server01) should be a &quot;clean&quot; computer that has no operating system installed, the hard disk is not partitioned, and bootable CD-ROM support, if available, is disabled. The other (Computer 2) may be the computer you installed Windows 2000 Professional on in <a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a>.

<ul>
<li>Server01 will be running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server as a domain controller. (This will be accomplished during the exercises in this chapter.)</li>

<li>Computer 2 will be networked to Server01 and running either Windows 95 or Windows 98<i>,</i> Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 Workstation, or Windows 2000 Professional. This can be the computer you installed Windows 2000 Professional on in <a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a> of this book.</li>

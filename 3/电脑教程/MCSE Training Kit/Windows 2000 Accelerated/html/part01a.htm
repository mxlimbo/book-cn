<h1><a name="2085">Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional </a></h1>


<p>Part 1 contains most of the information that relates to the Windows 2000 Professional portion of the 70-240 exam. The chapters in this part primarily use Windows 2000 Professional during the various hands-on practices and exercises. However, much of the information presented here is also applicable to Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p>This part covers installing Windows 2000 Professional, configuring hardware (such as disk drives, printers, etc.), managing resources (such as files, folders, and such), and provides an overview of network protocols. It also covers monitoring and securing the system. Much of this information will be familiar to a Windows NT 4.0 professional, but it lays a groundwork for the rest of the training kit.</p>

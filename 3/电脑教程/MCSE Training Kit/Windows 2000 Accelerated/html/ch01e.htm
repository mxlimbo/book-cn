<h1><a name="106">Lesson 4: Automating Installations</a></h1>

<p>The previously discussed installation methods required that someone be physically present to respond to system prompts during installation. That is not a convenient situation when multiple systems are being installed.</p>
<p>This lesson presents methods that will help you to automate Windows 2000 Professional installations. When you must install Windows 2000 Professional on computers with varying configurations, scripting provides automation with increased flexibility. You will learn how the improved Setup Manager makes it easy to create the Unattend.txt files that are necessary for scripted installations.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Automate installations of Windows 2000 Professional by using the Windows 2000 Setup Manager wizard</li>
<li>Apply application update packs while upgrading previous versions of Windows</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b></p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="107">Automating Installations by Using the Windows 2000 Setup Manager</a></h2>

<p>The computers in most networks are not identical, but they still have many similarities. You can use installation scripts to specify the variations in the hardware configurations of the computers that are to be installed with 
Windows 2000 Professional.</p>
<p>One of the most significant improvements in Windows 2000 Professional is the ease and flexibility of scripting installations. The new Windows 2000 Setup Manager wizard allows you to quickly create a script for a customized installation of Windows 2000 Professional. Knowing how to use Setup Manager enables you to perform customized installations on workstations and servers that meet the specific hardware and network requirements of your organization.</p>
<p>You can create or modify an answer file by using Setup Manager (see Figure 1.6). Although you can still use Unattend.txt files created with a simple text editor, such as Notepad, using Setup Manager will reduce errors in syntax. You can copy Setup Manager to your hard disk by extracting the files in the Deploy.cab file located on your Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM in the Support\Tools folder. To extract the files, double-click the .CAB file to display the files, select the files you want to extract, right-click the files, and then click Extract on the menu that appears.</p>
<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
For detailed steps on how to install Setup Manager, see the next Practice, &quot;<a href="ch01e.htm#108">Installing the Windows 2000 Professional Installation Deployment Tools</a>,&quot; in this chapter.

</div>

<p>Setup Manager does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a graphical interface with which you can create and modify answer files and UDFs  </li>
<li>Allows you to specify computer-specific or user-specific information</li>
<li>Allows you to include application setup scripts in the answer file</li>
<li>Creates the distribution folder that you use for the installation files</li>
</ul>

<p>When you start Setup Manager, you will be presented with the following three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create A New Answer File</li>
<li>Create An Answer File That Duplicates This Computer's Configuration</li>
<li>Modify An Existing Answer File</li>
</ul>
<p>If you select the Create A New Answer File option, you then need to choose the type of answer file you want to create. Setup Manager can create the following types of answer files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 2000 Professional unattended installation</li>
<li>Sysprep installation</li>
<li>Remote Installation Services (RIS)
<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
Remote Installation Services will be discussed in Lesson 6 of this chapter, &quot;Performing Remote Installations.&quot;
</div></blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining options in the Setup Manager wizard allow you to specify the level of user interaction with the Setup program and to enter all the information required to complete Setup.</p>

<h2><a name="108">Practice: Installing the Windows 2000 Professional Installation Deployment Tools</a></h2>

<p>In this practice, you extract the Windows 2000 Professional installation deployment tools from the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM you used to install Windows 2000 Professional. You then use System Manager to create an unattended setup script.</p>
<h3><a name="109">Exercise 1: Extracting the Windows 2000 Professional Installation Deployment Tools</a></h3>

<p>In this exercise, you extract the Windows 2000 Professional installation deployment tools from the CD-ROM you used to install Windows 2000 Professional and copy them to your hard disk.</p>

<ol>
<li>Log on as Administrator and insert the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.</li>
<li>Start Windows Explorer and create the folder Deploy in the root folder of drive C: (or in the root folder of your system drive).
<p>The Deploy folder will be used to store the files extracted from the Deploy.cab file on the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM.</p></li>
<li>Double-click the Deploy file in the Support\Tools folder on drive D.
<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
If D isn't the correct drive letter for your CD-ROM drive, replace the D in these instructions with the letter representing your CD-ROM drive.
</div></blockquote>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional displays the contents of the Deploy.cab file.</p></li>
<li>Select all of the files listed in the Deploy.cab file.
<blockquote><div class="tip"><b>TIP</b><hr />
To select all the files in the Deploy.cab file, hold down the Ctrl key, and then click each of the files listed. If your file icons are listed in one column, you can also select the files by clicking the first file in the list, holding down the Shift key, and then clicking the last file in the list.
</div></blockquote></li>
<li>Right-click any of the selected files and click Extract on the menu that appears.
<p>The Browse For Folder dialog box appears.</p></li>
<li>Select the Deploy folder on drive C (or your system drive, if it is a drive other than C), and then click OK.
<p>The Copying dialog box appears briefly as the files are extracted and copied to the Deploy folder.</p></li>
<li>In Windows Explorer, click the Deploy folder to view its contents.
<p>You should see the seven files from the Deploy.cab file listed. These files have been extracted from the .CAB file and are now ready to use.</p></li>
<li>Double-click Readme.txt.</li>
<li>Take a moment to view the topics covered in the Readme.txt file, and then close Notepad.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="110">Exercise 2: Using Setup Manager to Create an Unattended Setup Script</a></h3>

<h2><a name="111">Lesson Summary</a></h2>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that the Windows 2000 Professional Setup Manager wizard makes it easy to create the Unattend.txt files that are necessary for scripted installations. Setup Manager provides an easy-to-use graphical interface with which you can create and modify answer files and UDFs.</p>
<p>You also learned that before you can use the Setup Manager wizard, you must copy the Windows 2000 Professional deployment tools, including Setup Manager, by extracting the files located in the Deploy.cab file on the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM. The Setup Manager wizard makes it easy to specify computer-specific or user-specific information, and to include application setup scripts in the answer file. The Setup Manager wizard also creates the distribution folder that you use for the installation files.</p>

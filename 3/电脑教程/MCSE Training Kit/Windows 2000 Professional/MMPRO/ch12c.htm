<A NAME="400"><H1>Lesson 2: Setting Up Network Printers</H1></A>

<p>Setting up and sharing a network printer makes it possible for multiple users to print to it. You can set up a printer for a local print device that is connected directly to the print server, or you can set up a printer for a network-interface print device that is connected to the print server over the network. In larger organizations, most printers point to network-interface print devices.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the requirements for setting up a network printer and network printing resources.</li></p>

<p><li>Add and share a new printer for a local print device or a network-interface print device.</li></p>

<p><li>Set up client computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>

<A NAME="401"><H2>Adding and Sharing a Printer for a Local Print Device</H2></A>

<p>The steps for adding a printer for a local print device or for a network-interface print device are similar. First, you add the printer for a local print device, as follows.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on as Administrator on the print server.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.</li></p>

<p>You add and share a printer by using the Add Printer wizard in the Printers folder.</p>

<p><li>Double-click Add Printer to launch the Add Printer wizard.</li></p>

<p>The Add Printer wizard starts with the Welcome To The Add Printer Wizard page displayed.</p>

<p><li>Click Next and the Add Printer wizard displays the Local Or Network Printer page (see Figure 12.2).</li></p>
</ol>

<p>The Add Printer wizard guides you through the steps to add a printer for a print device that is connected to the print server. The number of local print devices that you can connect to a print server through physical ports depends on your hardware configuration.</p>

<A NAME="402"><H2>Adding and Sharing a Printer for a Network-Interface Print Device</H2></A>

<p>In larger companies, most print devices are network-interface print devices. These print devices offer several advantages. You don't need to locate print devices with the print server. In addition, network connections transfer data more quickly than printer cable connections.</p>

<p>You add a printer for a network-interface print device by using the Add Printer wizard. The main differences between adding a printer for a local print device and adding a printer for a network-interface print device is that for a typical network-interface print device, you provide additional port and network protocol information.</p>

<p>The default network protocol for Windows 2000 is TCP/IP, which many network-interface print devices use. For TCP/IP, you provide additional port information in the Add Standard TCP/IP Printer Port wizard.</p>

<p>Figure 12.3 shows the Select The Printer Port page of the Add Printer wizard, and Table 12.3 describes the options on the Select The Printer Port page that pertain to adding a network-interface print device.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
If your print device uses a network protocol other than TCP/IP, you must install the network protocol before you can add a printer for this device.

</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="403"><H2>Setting Up Client Computers</H2></A>

<p>After you add and share a printer, you need to set up client computers so that users can print. Although the tasks to set up client computers vary depending on which operating systems are running on the client computers, all client computers require that a printer driver be installed.</p>

<p>The following summarizes the installation of printer drivers according to the computer's operating system:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Windows 2000 automatically downloads the printer drivers for client computers running Windows 2000, Windows NT version 4 and earlier, Windows 98, or Windows 95.</li></p>

<p><li>Client computers running other Microsoft operating systems require installation of printer drivers.</li></p>

<p><li>Client computers running non-Microsoft operating systems require installation of both printer drivers and the print service on the print server.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="404"><H3>Client Computers Running Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows 98, or Windows 95</H3></A>

<p>Users of client computers running Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows 95 need to make a connection only to the shared printer. The client computer automatically downloads the appropriate printer driver, as long as a copy of it resides on the print server.</p>

<p>If your client computer is running Windows 2000 and you want to make a connection to the shared printer, on the client computer, start the Add Printer wizard. On the Local Or Network Printer page (see Figure 12.2), select Network Printer, and then click Next. The Locate Your Printer page appears (see Figure 12.5).</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 12.5</b> <i>The Locate Your Printer page</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>If you aren't sure what the name of the shared printer is, you can browse for it by leaving the Name box blank and clicking Next. The Browse For Printer page appears (see Figure 12.6).</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F12TK06x.htm')"> <img src="images/F12TK06.JPG" width=404 height=309 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 12.6</b> <i>The Browse For Printer page</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>Once you have located the shared printer and selected it, click Next and you will be asked whether it should be the default printer. If you want it to be the default printer, click Yes; otherwise, click No and then click Next. The Completing The Add Printer Wizard page appears. Check over the information and then click Finish. You have successfully made a connection from your client computer to the shared printer.</p>

<A NAME="405"><H3>Client Computers Running Other Microsoft Operating Systems</H3></A>

<p>For client computers running other Microsoft operating systems (such as Windows 3.<i>x</i> or MS-DOS) to print to a shared Windows 2000-based printer, you must manually install a printer driver on the client computer. You can get the appropriate printer driver for a Windows-based client computer from the installation disks for that client computer or from the printer manufacturer.</p>

<A NAME="406"><H3>Client Computers Running Non-Microsoft Operating Systems</H3></A>

<p>To enable users of client computers running non-Microsoft operating systems to print, the print server must have additional services installed on it. Table 12.5 lists services that are required for Macintosh and UNIX client computers or computers running a NetWare client.</p>

<A NAME="407"><H2>Practice: Installing a Network Printer</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will use the Add Printer wizard to install and share a local printer. By sharing the printer, it becomes available to other users on the network. You will also take the printer offline and then print a document. Printing a document with the printer offline loads the document into the print queue.</p>

<A NAME="408"><H3>Exercise 1: Adding and Sharing a Printer</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will use the Add Printer wizard to add a local printer to your computer and share it.</p>

<p><li><b>To add a local printer</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on as Administrator.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the Printers window. If you added a fax modem, a Fax icon appears in the Printers system folder.</p>

<p><li>Double-click Add Printer.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Add Printer Wizard, click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Add Printer wizard prompts you for the location of the printer. Because you are creating the printer on the computer at which you are sitting and not on a different computer, this printer is referred to as a local printer.</p>

<p><li>Click Local Printer, ensure that the Automatically Detect And Install My Plug And Play Printer check box is not selected, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>Which port types are available depends on the installed network protocols. For this exercise, assume that the print device that you are adding is directly attached to your computer and using the LPT1 port.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If the print device is connected to a port that is not listed, click Other, and then enter the port type.

</p>

<ol start=6>
<p><li>Verify that the Use The Following Port option is selected, and then under Use The Following Port, select LPT1.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The wizard prompts you for the printer manufacturer and model. You will add an HP LaserJet 5Si printer.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
The list of printers is sorted in alphabetical order. If you can't find a printer name, make sure that you are looking in the correct location.

<ol start=8>
<p><li>Under Manufacturers, click HP; under Printers, click HP LaserJet 5Si; and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The wizard displays the Name Your Printer page. In the Printer Name box, Windows 2000 automatically defaults to the printer name HP LaserJet 5Si. For this exercise, do not change this name.</p>

<p><li>If other printers are already installed, the wizard will also ask whether you want to make this the default printer. If the wizard displays the message, Do You Want Your Windows-Based Programs To Use This Printer As The Default Printer?, click Yes.</li></p>

<p><li>To accept the default printer name, click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Printer Sharing page appears, prompting you for printer sharing information.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To share a printer</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the Add Printer Wizard, on the Printer Sharing page, select the Share As option.</li></p>

<p>Notice that you can assign a shared printer name, even though you already supplied a printer name. The shared printer name is used to identify a printer on the network and must conform to a naming convention. This shared name is different from the printer name that you entered previously. The printer name is a description that will appear with the printer's icon in the Printers system folder and in Active Directory directory services.</p>

<p><li>In the Share As box, type <b>Printer1</b> and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Location And Comment page appears.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If your computer running Windows 2000 Professional is part of a domain, Windows 2000 displays the values that you enter for Location and Comment when a user searches Active Directory directory services for a printer. Entering this information is optional, but it can help users locate the printer more easily.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol start=3>
<p><li>In the Location box, type <b>Third Floor East</b> and in the Comment box, type <b>Mail Room</b>, click option, and click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Print Test Page page appears, prompting you whether you want to print a test page.</p>

<p><li>Click No and then click Next.</li></p>

<p>The wizard displays the Completing The Add Printer Wizard page and provides a summary of your installation choices.</p>

<p><li>Confirm the summary of your installation choices, and then click Finish.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 will either copy files from the <i>systemroot</i> folder or display the Files Needed dialog box, prompting you for the location of the Windows 2000 Professional distribution files. If the Files Needed dialog box appears, continue with step 6; otherwise, Windows 2000 creates the shared printer and displays an icon for the HP LaserJet 5Si printer in the Printers window. In this case, you can skip steps 6-8.</p>

<p><li>Insert the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM, and wait for about 10 seconds.</li></p>

<p><li>If Windows displays the Windows 2000 CD-ROM window, close it.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK to close the Insert Disk dialog box.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 copies the printer files and creates the shared printer. An icon for the HP LaserJet 5Si printer appears in the Printers window.</p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 displays an open hand under the printer icon. This indicates that the printer is shared. Notice also the check mark just above the printer, which indicates that the printer is the default printer.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="409"><H3>Exercise 2: Taking a Printer Offline and Printing a Test Document</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will take the printer that you created offline. Taking a printer offline causes documents that you send to this printer to be held on the computer while the print device is not available. Doing this will eliminate error messages about unavailable print devices in later exercises. Windows 2000 will display such error messages when it attempts to send documents to a print device that isn't connected to the computer.</p>

<p><li><b>To take a printer offline</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the Printers window, click the HP LaserJet 5Si icon.</li></p>

<p><li>On the File menu, click Use Printer Offline.</li></p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 changes the icon to reflect that the printer is not available, and that the Status of the printer states Use Printer Offline.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To print a test document</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the Printers window, double-click the HP LaserJet 5Si icon.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the list of documents to be sent to the print device is empty.</p>

<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Notepad.</li></p>

<p><li>In Notepad, type any text that you want.</li></p>

<p><li>Arrange Notepad and the HP LaserJet 5Si window so that you can see the contents of each.</li></p>

<p><li>In Notepad, on the File menu, click Print.</li></p>

<p>The Print dialog box appears, allowing you to select the printer and print options.</p>

</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol start=6>
<p>The Print dialog box displays the location and comment information that you entered when you created the printer, and it shows that the printer is currently offline. You can also use this dialog box to search Active Directory directory services for a printer.</p>

<p>Notice that HP LaserJet 5Si is selected as the printer.</p>

<p><li>Click Print.</li></p>

<p>Notepad briefly displays a message, stating that the document is printing on your computer. On a fast computer, you might not be able to see this message.</p>

<p>In the HP LaserJet 5Si window, you will see the document waiting to be sent to the print device. Windows 2000 holds the document because you took the printer offline. Otherwise, Windows 2000 would have sent the document to the print device.</p>

<p><li>Close Notepad and click No when prompted to save changes to your document.</li></p>

<p><li>Because we don't want to print the document sitting in the print queue, select the document in the HP LaserJet 5Si window, and select Cancel All Documents from the Printer menu.</li></p>

<p>A Printers dialog box appears asking if you are sure you want to cancel all the documents.</p>

<p><li>Click Yes.</li></p>

<p>The document is removed from the HP LaserJet 5Si window.</p>

<A NAME="410"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that to set up and share a printer for a local print device or for a network-interface print device, you use the Add Printer wizard in the Printers folder. Sharing a local printer makes it possible for multiple users on the network to print to it.</p>

<p>You also learned that users of client computers running Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows 98, or Windows 95 need to make a connection only to the shared printer to be able to print. The client computer automatically downloads the appropriate printer driver, as long as a copy of it exists on the print server. For client computers running other Microsoft operating systems (such as Windows 3.<i>x</i> or MS-DOS) to print to a shared Windows 2000-based printer, you must manually install a printer driver on the client computer. You can get the appropriate printer driver for a Windows-based client computer from the installation disks for that client computer or from the printer manufacturer. To enable users of client computers running non-Microsoft operating systems to print, the print server must have additional services installed on it.</p>

<A NAME="884"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> What is the major difference between a workgroup and a domain?</li></p>


<p><b>The major difference between a workgroup and a domain is where the user account information resides for user logon authentication. For a workgroup, user account information resides in the local security database on each computer in the workgroup. For the domain, the user 
account information resides in the Active Directory database.</b></p>

<p><li> What are Active Directory directory services, and what do they provide?</li></p>


<p><b>Active Directory directory services comprise the Windows 2000 directory service. A directory service consists of a database that stores information about network resources, such as computers and printers, and the services that make this information available to users and applications. 
Active Directory directory services also provide administrators with the capability to control access to resources.</b></p>


<p><li> What information must a user provide when he or she logs on to a computer?</li></p>


<p><b>A user name and a password.</b></p>


<p><li> What happens when a user logs on locally to a computer?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 authenticates the user during the logon process by comparing the user's logon information to the user's information in the local database and verifies the identity of the user. Only valid users can gain access to resources and data on a computer.</b></p>


<p><li> How do you use the Windows 2000 Security dialog box?</li></p>

<p><b>The Windows 2000 Security dialog box provides easy access to important security options, which include the ability to lock a computer, change a password, log off of a computer, stop programs that aren't responding, and shut down the computer.</b></p>

<p><li> You are installing Windows 2000 Server on a computer that will be a client in an existing Windows 2000 domain. You want to add the computer to the domain during installation. What information do you need, and which computers must be available on the network before you run the Setup program?</li></p>


<p><b>You need the DNS domain name of the domain that you are joining. You must also make sure that a computer account for the client exists in the domain, or you must have the user name and password of a user account in the domain with the authority to create computer accounts in the 
domain. A server running the DNS service and a domain controller in 
the domain you are joining must be available on the network.</b></p>


<p><li> You are using a CD-ROM to install Windows 2000 Professional on a computer that was previously running another operating system. How should you configure the hard disk to simplify the installation process?</li></p>

<p><b>Use a disk partitioning tool to remove any existing partitions, and then create and format a new partition for the Windows 2000 installation.</b></p>


<p><li> You are installing Windows 2000 Professional over the network. Before you install to a client computer, what must you do?</li></p>


<p><b>Locate the path to the shared installation files on the distribution server. Create a 500-MB FAT partition on the target computer (1 GB recommended). Create a client disk with a network client so that you can connect from the computer, without an operating system, to the distribution server.</b></p>

<A NAME="897"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> What is the registry and what does it do?</li></p>


<p><b>The registry is a hierarchical database that stores Windows 2000 hardware and software settings. The registry controls the Windows 2000 
operating system by providing the appropriate initialization information to start applications and load components, such as device drivers and network protocols. The registry contains a variety of different types of data, including the hardware installed on the computer, the installed 
device drivers, applications, network protocols, and network adapter card settings.</b></p>


<p><li> What is a hive?</li></p>


<p><b>A hive is a discrete body of keys, subkeys, and entries. Each hive has 
a corresponding registry file and a .LOG file located in <i>systemroot</i>\System32\Config. Windows 2000 uses the .LOG file to record changes and to ensure the integrity of the registry.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the recommended editor for viewing and modifying the registry?</li></p>


<p><b>Regedt32.exe is the recommended editor for viewing and modifying the registry.</b></p>


<p><li> What option should you enable when you are viewing the contents of the registry? Why?</li></p>

<p><b>Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, systemwide problems that could require reinstallation of Windows 2000. When using 
Registry Editor to view data, save a backup copy of the registry file 
before viewing and click Read Only Mode on the Options menu to prevent accidental updating or deleting of configuration data.</b></p>

What is the problem and how would you resolve it?</li></p>

<p><b>You can create striped volumes only on dynamic disks. The option to 
create a partition rather than a volume indicates that the disk you are trying to use is a basic disk. You will need to upgrade all of the disks

</ol>

<A NAME="914"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> Your computer running Windows 2000 Client for Microsoft Networks was configured manually for TCP/IP. You can connect to any host on your own subnet, but you can't connect to or even ping any host on a remote subnet. What is the likely cause of the problem and how would you fix it?</li></p>


<p><b>The default gateway might be missing or incorrect. You specify the 
default gateway in the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog 
box (under Network And Dial-Up Connections in My Network Places). Other possibilities are that the default gateway is offline or that the subnet mask is incorrect.</b></p>


<p><li> Your computer running Windows 2000 Professional can communicate with some, but not all, of the NetWare servers on your network. Some of the NetWare servers are running frame type 802.2 and some are running 802.3. What is the likely cause of the problem?</li></p>


<p><b>Although the NWLink implementation in Windows 2000 can automatically detect a frame type for IPX/SPX-compatible protocols, it can automatically detect only one frame type. This network uses two frame types; you must manually configure the additional frame type (802.3).</b></p>


<p><li> What are the limitations of the NetBEUI protocol?</li></p>


<p><b>NetBEUI can't be routed and therefore is not suitable for WANs. 
Since NetBEUI isn't routable, you must connect computers running 
Windows 2000 and NetBEUI by using bridges instead of routers.</b></p>

<p><b>The NetBEUI protocol relies on broadcasts for many of its functions, such as name registration and discovery, so it creates more broadcast traffic than other protocols.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the primary function of the DLC protocol?</li></p>

<p><b>DLC provides connectivity to IBM mainframes and to LAN print devices that are directly attached to the network.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the significance of the binding order of network protocols?</li></p>


<p><b>You specify the binding order to optimize network performance. For 
example, a computer running Windows 2000 Workstation has NetBEUI, NWLink IPX/SPX, and TCP/IP installed. However, most of the servers

<ol>
<p><li> What is the function of the following DNS components?</li></p>


<p>Domain name space</p>

<p><b>The domain name space provides the hierarchical structure for the DNS distributed database.</b></p>

<p>Zones</p>

<p><b>Zones are used to divide the domain name space into administrative units.</b></p>

<p>Name servers</p>

<p><b>Name servers store the zone information and perform name resolution for their authoritative domain name spaces.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you want to have multiple name servers?</li></p>


<p><b>Installing multiple name servers provides redundancy, reduces the load on the server that stores the primary zone database file, and allows for faster access speed for remote locations.</b></p>


<p><li> What's the difference between a forward lookup query and a reverse lookup query?</li></p>


<p><b>A forward lookup query resolves a name to an IP address. A reverse lookup query resolves an IP address to a name.</b></p>


<p><li> When would you configure your connection to obtain a DNS server address automatically?</li></p>

<p><b>Configure your connection to obtain a DNS server address automatically only if you have a functioning DHCP server on the network that can provide the IP address of functioning DNS servers on the network.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> What are four major features of Active Directory directory services?</li></p>


<p><b>Active Directory directory services offer simplified administration, scaleability, open standards support, and support for standard name 
formats.</b></p>


<p><li> What are sites and domains, and how are they different?</li></p>


<p><b>A site is a combination of one or more IP subnets that should be connected by a high-speed link.</b></p>

<p><b>A domain is a logical grouping of servers and other network resources organized under a single name.</b></p>

<p><b>A site is a component of Active Directory directory services' physical structure, while a domain is a component of the logical structure.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the schema, and how can you extend it?</li></p>


<p><b>The schema contains a formal definition of the contents and structure 
of Active Directory directory services, including all attributes, classes, and class properties. You can extend the schema by using the Schema Manager snap-in or the Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI).</b></p>


<p><li>Which Windows 2000 products provide Active Directory directory services?</li></p>


<p><b>Only the Windows 2000 Server products, which include Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter, provide Active Directory directory services. Windows 2000 Professional doesn't provide Active Directory directory services, but clients running Windows 2000 Professional that are members of a domain can use Active Directory directory services.</b></p>

<A NAME="917"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> Where does Windows 2000 create local user accounts?</li></p>


<p><b>When you create a local user account, Windows 2000 creates the account only in that computer's security database.</b></p>


<p><li> What different capabilities do domain user accounts and local user accounts provide to users?</li></p>

<p><b>A domain user account allows a user to log on to the domain from any computer in the network and to gain access to resources anywhere in 
the domain, provided the user has permission to access these resources. 
A local user account allows the user to log on at and gain access to 
resources on only the computer where you create the local user account.</b></p>


<p><li> What should you consider when you plan new user accounts?</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li><b>A naming convention that ensures unique but consistent user account names.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Whether you or the user will determine the user account password.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Whether the user account should be disabled.</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> What information is required to create a local user account?</li></p>


<p><b>A user name.</b></p>


<p><li> What are built-in user accounts and what are they used for?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 automatically creates accounts called built-in accounts. Two commonly used built-in accounts are Administrator and Guest. You use the built-in Administrator account to manage the overall computer (for example, creating and modifying user accounts and groups, and 
setting account properties on user accounts). You use the built-in Guest account to give occasional users the ability to log on and gain access to resources.</b></p>

<A NAME="918"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> Why should you use groups?</li></p>


<p><b>Use groups to simplify administration by granting rights and assigning permissions once to the group rather than multiple times to each individual member.</b></p>


<p><li> How do you create a local group?</li></p>


<p><b>Start the Computer Management snap-in and expand Local Users And Groups. Right-click Groups, and then click New Group. Fill in the appropriate fields and then click Create.</b></p>


<p><li> Are there any consequences to deleting a group?</li></p>


<p><b>When you delete a group, the unique identifier that the system uses to represent the group is lost. Even if you create a second group with the same name, the group will not have the same identifier, so you must grant the group any permissions or rights that it once had, and you must add back the users who need to be a member of that group.</b></p>


<p><li> What's the difference between built-in local groups and local groups?</li></p>


<p><b>You create local groups and assign the appropriate permissions to them.</b></p>

<p><b>Windows 2000 Professional comes with precreated built-in local groups. You can't create built-in local groups. Built-in local groups give rights

<A NAME="919"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> What's the difference between a printer and a print device?</li></p>


<p><b>A printer is the software interface between the operating system and 
the print device. The print device is the hardware device that produces printed documents.</b></p>


<p><li> A print server can connect to two different types of print devices. What are these two types of print devices, and what are the differences?</li></p>


<p><b>The two types are local and network-interface print devices. A local 
print device is connected directly to a physical port of the print server. 
A network-interface print device is connected to the print server through the network. Also, a network-interface print device requires a network interface card.</b></p>


<p><li> You have added and shared a printer. What must you do to set up client computers running Windows 2000 so that users can print, and why?</li></p>


<p><b>You (or the user) must make a connection to the printer from the client computer. When you make a connection to the printer from the client computer, Windows 2000 automatically copies the printer driver to the client computer.</b></p>


<p><li> What advantages does connecting to a printer by using http://<i>server_name</i>/printers provide for users?</li></p>


<p><b>It allows a user to make a connection to a printer without having to use the Add Printer wizard. It makes a connection to a Web site, which displays all of the printers for which the user has permission. The Web site also provides information on the printers to help the user make the correct selection. Also, a Web designer can customize this Web page, such as by displaying a floor plan that shows the location of print devices, which makes it easier for users to choose a print device.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you connect multiple printers to one print device?</li></p>


<p><b>To set priorities between the printers so that users can send critical documents to the printer with the highest priority. These documents will always print before documents that are sent from printers with lower priorities.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you create a printer pool?</li></p>


<p><b>To speed up printing. Users can print to one printer that has several print devices so that documents do not wait in the print queue. It also simplifies administration; it's easier to manage one printer for several print devices than it is to manage one printer for each print device.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> User101 is a member of Group1, Group2, and Group3. Group1 has Read permission and Group3 has Full Control permission for FolderA. Group2 has no permissions assigned for FolderA. What are User101's effective permissions for FolderA?</li></p>


<p><b>Since User101 gets the permissions of all groups, User101's effective permission for FolderA is Full Control, which also includes all capabilities of the Read permission.</b></p>


<p><li> User101 is also a member of the Sales group, which has the Read permission for FolderB. User101 has been denied the shared folder permission Full Control for FolderB as an individual user. What are User101's effective permissions for FolderB?</li></p>


<p><b>User101 has no access to FolderB. Even though User101 is a member of the Sales group, which has Read permission for FolderB, User101 has been denied Full Control access to FolderB. Denied permissions override all other permissions.</b></p>

<A NAME="942"><H3>Lesson 4: Combining Shared Folder Permissions and NTFS Permissions</H3></A>

<A NAME="943"><H3>Practice: Managing Shared Folders</H3></A>

<A NAME="944"><H3>Exercise 1: Combining Permissions </H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li> In the first example, the Data folder is shared. The Sales group has the shared folder Read permission for the Data folder and the NTFS Full Control permission for the Sales subfolder.</li></p>


<p>What are the Sales group's effective permissions for the Sales subfolder when they gain access to the Sales subfolder by making a connection to the Data shared folder?</p>

<p><b>The Sales group has the Read permission for the Sales subfolder because when shared folder permissions are combined with NTFS permissions, the more restrictive permission applies.</b></p>


<p><li> In the second example, the Users folder contains user home folders. Each user home folder contains data that is accessible only to the user for whom the folder is named. The Users folder has been shared, and the Users group has the shared folder Full Control permission for the Users folder. User1 and User2 have the NTFS Full Control permission for <i>only</i> their home folder and no NTFS permissions for other folders. These users are all members of the Users group.</li></p>


<p>What permissions does User1 have when he or she accesses the User1 subfolder by making a connection to the Users shared folder? What are User1's permissions for the User2 subfolder?</p>

<p><b>User1 has the Full Control permission for the User1 subfolder because both the shared folder permission and the NTFS permission allow Full Control. User1 can't access the User2 subfolder because she or he has no NTFS permissions to gain access to it.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="945"><H3>Exercise 2: Planning Shared Folders</H3></A>

<p>Record your answers in the table.</p>

<p><b>You have two choices for permissions. You can rely entirely on NTFS permissions and assign Full Control for all shared folders to the Everyone group, or you can use shared folder permissions according to resource needs. The following suggested shared folders include required permissions if you decide to assign shared folder permissions.</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Share Management Guidelines as MgmtGd. Assign the Full Control permission to the Managers group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Data as Data. Assign the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Data\Customer Service as CustServ. Assign the Change permission to the Customer Service group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Data\Public as Public. Assign the Change permission to the Users built-in group.</b></li></p>


<p><li><b>Share Applications as Apps. Assign the Read permission to the Users built-in group and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Project Management as ProjMan. Assign the Change permission to the Managers group and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Database\Customers as CustDB. Assign the Change permission to the CustomerDBFull group, the Read permission to the CustomerDBRead group, and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></li></p>

<p><li><b>Share Users as Users. Create a folder for every employee below this folder. Assign the Full Control permission to each employee for his or her own folder. Preferably, have Windows 2000 create the folder and assign permissions automatically when you create each user account.</b></li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="946"><H3>Exercise 4: Assigning Shared Folder Permissions</H3></A>


<p><li><b>To assign Full Control to the Administrators group</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="3"> Click OK.</li></p>


<p>Windows 2000 adds Administrators to the list of names with permissions.</p>

<p>Which type of access does Windows 2000 assign to Administrators by 
default?</p>

<p><b>The Read permission.</b></p>


<p><li> In the Permissions box, under Allow, click the Full Control check box.</li></p>


<p>Why did Windows Explorer also select the Change permission for you?</p>

<p><b>Full Control includes both the Change permission and the Read 
permission.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="947"><H3>Exercise 5 (Optional): Connecting to a Shared Folder</H3></A>


<p><li><b>To connect a network drive to a shared folder by using the Map Network Drive command</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="5"> To complete the connection, click Finish.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the MktApps On 'PRO1' (P:) window.</p>

<p>How does Windows Explorer indicate that this drive points to a remote shared folder?</p>

<p><b>Windows Explorer uses an icon that shows a network cable attached to the drive. The network cable icon indicates a mapped network drive.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="948"><H3>Exercise 8 (Optional): Testing NTFS and Shared Folder Permissions</H3></A>


<p><li><b>To test permissions for the Manuals folder when a user logs on locally</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="3"> In the Manuals folder, attempt to create a file.</li></p>


<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>No. Only Administrators have the NTFS permission to create and modify files in the Manuals folder.</b></p>
</ol>


<p><li><b>To test permissions for the Manuals folder when a user makes a connection over the network</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="7"> In the Manuals window, attempt to create a file.</li></p>


<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>No. Although the Users group has the Full Control shared folder permission for \\PRO1\MktApps, only Administrators have the NTFS permission to create and modify files in the Manuals folder.</b></p>
</ol>


<p><li><b>To test permissions for the Manuals folder when a user logs on over the network as Administrator</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="4"> In the Manuals window, attempt to create a file.</li></p>


<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>Yes. Administrator has the Full Control NTFS permission for the folder and Full Control Shared folder permissions for \\PRO1\MktApps\Manuals.</b></p>
</ol>


<p><li><b>To test permissions for the Public folder when a user makes a connection over the network</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="5"> In the Public window, attempt to create a file.</li></p>


<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>Yes. User1 has the Full Control NTFS permission for the folder and Full Control Shared folder permissions for \\PRO1\MktApps\Public.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="949"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> When a folder is shared on a FAT volume, what does a user with the Full Control shared folder permissions for the folder have access to?</li></p>


<p><b>All folders and files in the shared folder.</b></p>


<p><li>What are the shared folder permissions?</li></p>


<p><b>Full Control, Change, and Read.</b></p>


<p><li> By default, what are the permissions that are assigned to a shared folder?</li></p>


<p><b>The Everyone group is assigned the Full Control permission.</b></p>

<p><li> When a folder is shared on an NTFS volume, what does a user with the Full Control shared folder permissions for the folder have access to?</li></p>


<p><b>Only the folder, but not necessarily any of the folder's contents. The user would also need NTFS permissions for each file and subfolder in the shared folder to gain access to those files and subfolders.</b></p>


<p><li> When you share a public folder, why should you use centralized data folders?</li></p>


<p><b>Centralized data folders enable data to be backed up easily.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the best way to secure files and folders that you share on NTFS partitions?</li></p>


<p><b>Put the files that you want to share in a shared folder and keep the 
default shared folder permission (the Everyone group with the Full 
Control permission for the shared folder). Assign NTFS permissions to users and groups to control access to all contents in the shared folder or to individual files.</b></p>
</ol>

<h1>Chapter 16</h1>


<A NAME="950"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> What two tasks must you perform to audit access to a file?</li></p>


<p><b>Set the audit policy for object access and configure the file for the type of access to audit.</b></p>


<p><li> Who can set up auditing for a computer?</li></p>

<p><b>By default, only members of the Administrators group can set up and 
administer auditing. You can also give other users the Manage Auditing and Security log user right, which is required to configure an audit policy and review audit logs.</b></p>


<p><li> When you view a security log, how do you determine whether an event failed or succeeded?</li></p>

<p><b>Successful events appear with a key icon; unsuccessful events appear with a lock icon.</b></p>


<p><li> If you click the Do Not Overwrite Events option in the Properties dialog box for an audit log, what happens when the log file becomes full?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 will stop. You must clear the log manually.</b></p>

<A NAME="952"><H3>Lesson 1: Configuring Account Policies</H3></A>

<A NAME="953"><H3>Practice: Configuring Account Policies</H3></A>

<A NAME="954"><H3>Exercise 2: Configuring and Testing Additional Account Policies Settings </H3></A>


<p><li><b>To configure Account Policies settings</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Use the Group Policy snap-in to configure the following Account Policies settings:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li>A user should have at least five different passwords before he or she accesses a previously used password.</li></p>

<p><li>After changing a password, a user must wait 24 hours before he or she can change it again.</li></p>

<p><li>A user should change his or her password every three weeks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Which settings did you use for each of the three listed items?</p>

<p><b>Set Enforce Password History to 5 so that a user must have at least five different passwords before he or she can access a previously used password.</b></p>

<p><b>Set Minimum Password Age to one day so that a user must wait 24 hours 
before he or she can change it again.</b></p>

<p><b>Set Maximum Password Age to 21 days so that a user must change his/her password every three weeks.</b></p>
</ol>


<p><li><b>To test Account Policies settings</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2"> Change your password to <i>waters.</i></li></p>

<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>You were successful because the minimum password length is set to 6, and the password <i>waters</i> contains six characters.</b></p>


<p><li> Change your password to <i>papers.</i></li></p>


<p>Were you successful? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>You weren't successful because you must wait 24 hours (one day) before you can change your password a second time. A Change Password dialog box appeared indicating that you can't change the password at this time.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="955"><H3>Exercise 3: Configuring Account Lockout Policy</H3></A>


<p><li><b>To configure the Account Lockout Policy settings</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="5"> Use Account Lockout Policy settings to do the following:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li>Lock out a user account after four failed logon attempts.</li></p>

<p><li>Lock out user accounts until the administrator unlocks the user account.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Which Account Lockout Policy settings did you use for each of the two 
conditions?</p>

<p><b>Set Account Lockout Threshold to 4 to lock out a user account after four failed logon attempts. When you set one of the three Account Lockout Policy options and the other two options have not been set, a dialog box appears indicating that the other two options will be set to default values.</b></p>

<p><b>Set Account Lockout Duration to 0 to have locked accounts remain locked until the administrator unlocks them.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="956"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>

<ol>
<p><li> Why would you want to force users to change passwords?</li></p>

<p><b>Forcing users to change passwords regularly will decrease the chances of an unauthorized person breaking into your computer. If a user account and password combination for your computer falls into unauthorized hands, forcing users to change their passwords regularly will cause the user account and password combination to fail and secure the computer.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you want to control the length of the passwords used on your computers?</li></p>

<p><b>Longer passwords are more difficult to figure out because there are more characters to discover. In general, you want to do what you can to make it difficult to get unauthorized access to your computers.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you want to lock out a user account?</li></p>


<p><b>If a user forgets his or her password, he or she can ask the administrator to reset the password. If someone repeatedly enters an incorrect password, the person is probably trying to gain unauthorized access to your computer. Setting a limit on the number of failed logon attempts and locking out any user account that exceeds this number makes it more 
difficult for someone to gain unauthorized access to your computers.</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you want to force users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete before they can log on to your computers?</li></p>


<p><b>To increase security on your computers, you can force users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete before they can log on. This key combination is recognized only by Windows and ensures that only Windows is receiving the password and not a Trojan horse program waiting to capture your password.</b></p>


<p><li> How do you prevent the last user name from being displayed in the Windows Security or Log On To Windows dialog box?</li></p>


<p><b>To prevent the last user name from being displayed in the Windows Security or Log On To Windows dialog box, click the Local Policies node in the console tree of the Local Security Settings window, and then click 
Security Options. In the details pane, right-click Do Not Display Last User Name In Logon Screen, click Security, and then disable this feature.</b></p>

<p><b>To create and manage shares on a remote folder, use the MMC to create a custom console and add the Shared Folders snap-in to it. When you add the Shared Folders snap-in, you specify the remote computer on which you want to create and manage shares. When adding the Shared Folders snap-in to the console, you can also select the Allow The Selected Computer To Be Changed When Launching From The Command Line check box so that you can choose the remote computer on which you want to create and manage shares.</b></p>

<p><li> What are the advantages of using L2TP over using PPTP?</li></p>


<p><b>L2TP supports more types of internetworks, it supports header compression, and it cooperates with IPSec for encryption.</b></p>


<p><li> While you're using the Network Connection wizard, you must configure two new settings regarding sharing the connection. Describe the difference between these two settings.</li></p>


<p><b>The settings are whether you want to allow others that use the computer to use the connection (access to the connection) and whether you want to allow other computers to access resources through this port (sharing the connection once it is established).</b></p>


<p><li> What is callback and when might you want to enable it?</li></p>


<p><b>The callback feature causes the remote server to disconnect and call back the client attempting to access the remote server. By using callback, you can have the bill for the phone call charged to your phone number rather than to the phone number of the user who called in. You can also use callback to increase security by specifying the callback number. Even if an unauthorized user calls in, the system calls back at the number you specified, not the number of the unauthorized user.</b></p>

<p><li> What are the five major phases of the boot process for Intel-based computers?</li></p>


<p><b>The boot process for Intel-based computers includes the preboot sequence, boot sequence, kernel load, kernel initialization, and logon phases.</b></p>


<p><li> What are the various Safe Mode advanced boot options for booting Windows 2000, and how do they differ?</li></p>


<p><b>The Safe Mode option loads only the basic devices and drivers required to start the system, including the mouse, keyboard, mass storage devices, base video, and the standard/default set of system services.</b></p>

<p><b>The Safe Mode With Networking option loads the devices and drivers loaded with the Safe Mode option, but it also loads the services and drivers required for networking.</b></p>

<p><b>The Safe Mode With Command Prompt option is identical to the Safe Mode option, but it launches a command prompt instead of Windows 
Explorer.</b></p>


<p><li> What are the two sections of the Boot.ini file, and what information does each section contain?</li></p>


<p><b>The two sections of the Boot.ini file are [boot loader] and [operating systems]. The [boot loader] section of Boot.ini specifies the default operating system and provides a timeout value.</b></p>

<p><b>The [operating systems] section of Boot.ini contains the list of operating systems that appear in the Boot Loader Operating System Selection menu. Each entry includes the path to the operating system and the name that appears in the Boot Loader Operating System Selection menu (the text between the quotation marks). Each entry can also contain optional parameters.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> How do you install the Windows 2000 deployment tools, such as the Setup Manager Wizard and the System Preparation tool?</li></p>


<p><b>To install the Windows 2000 Setup Tools, display the contents of the Deploy.cab file, which is located in the Support\Tools folder on the 
Windows 2000 CD-ROM. Select all the files you want to extract, right-click a selected file, and then select Extract from the menu. You will be prompted for a destination, the location and name of a folder, for the 
extracted files.</b></p>


<p><li> Which five resources are required to use Remote Installation Services to install Windows 2000 Professional?</li></p>


<p><b>A Windows 2000 Server with RIS installed, a DNS server available on 
the network, a DHCP server available on the network, a Windows 2000 domain to provide Active Directory directory services, and client computers that meet the Net PC specification or have a boot floppy to connect to the RIS server.</b></p>


<p><li> Which utility is provided to create boot floppies and how do you access it?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 ships with the Windows 2000 Remote Boot Disk Generator, rbfg.exe, which is used to create boot disks. It is found on the RIS Server in the folder where the Windows 2000 Professional installation files are stored. The path is RemoteInst\Admin\i386\rbfg.exe.</b></p>


<p><li> You are planning on installing 45 computers with Windows 2000 Professional. You have determined that these 45 computers have seven different network adapter cards. How can you determine whether these seven different types of network adapter cards are supported by the boot floppies you created?</li></p>


<p><b>The boot floppies created using Rbfg only support the PCI-based network adapters listed in the Adapters List. Start Rbfg.exe and then click the Adapter List button to see the list of supported adapters.</b></p>


<p><li> You have a laptop running Windows 95 and you want to upgrade it to Windows 2000. The computer has 16 MB of RAM, and this can be upgraded to 24 MB. Can you upgrade this computer to Windows 2000? If not, how would you make it so this computer was able to access Active Directory directory services?</li></p>


<p><b>No, Windows 2000 Professional requires at least 32 MB of memory. You can install the Directory Service Client for Windows 95 or 98. The laptop would then be able to access Active Directory directory services.</b></p>


<p><li> Name at least two problems the System Preparation tool resolves that makes creating and copying a master disk image to other computers much simpler to do.</li></p>


<p><b>The System Preparation tool adds a system service to the master image that will create a unique local domain security ID (SID) the first time the computer to which the master image is copied is started.</b></p>

<p><b>The System Preparation tool adds a Mini-Setup wizard to the master disk image that runs the first time the computer to which the master 
image is copied is started. It guides the user through entering the user-specific information such as the end-user license agreement, the Product ID, user name, company name, and time zone selection.</b></p>

<p><b>The System Preparation tool causes the master image to force the computer on which the master image is copied to run a full Plug and Play 
device detection, so that peripherals, such as the network adapter, the video adapter, and sound cards on the computer on which the disk image was copied need not be identical to the ones on the computer on which the image was generated.</b></p>

<p><li>A friend of yours just installed Windows 2000 Professional on his home computer. He called you to help him configure APM, and when you told him to double-click Power Options in Control Panel and click on the APM tab, he told you he did not have an APM tab. What is the most likely reason there is no APM tab?</li></p>


<p><b>The most likely reason there is no APM is that his computer does not have an APM-based BIOS installed. When Windows 2000 does not detect an APM-based BIOS, Setup does not install APM and there is no APM tab in the Power Options Properties dialog box.</b></p>


<p><li> A user calls the help desk in a panic. She spent 15 hours editing a proposal as an offline file at her house. Over the weekend, her boss came in and spent about four hours editing the same proposal. She needs to synchronize the files, but she doesn't want to lose her edits or those made by her boss. What can she do?</li></p>


<p><b>If both her cached offline copy of the file and the network copy of the file are edited, she should rename her version of the file so that both copies will exist on her hard disk and on the network. She could then compare the two and edit her version, adding any edits made by her boss.</b></p>


<p><li> Many commercial airlines require you to turn off portable computers during certain portions of a flight. Does placing your computer in Hibernate mode comply with these airline requirements? Why or why not?</li></p>


<p><b>No. Hibernate mode makes your computer appear to be turned off, but it is not. You must shut down your computer to comply with these airline requirements.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Your boss has started to manually assign resource settings to all devices, including Plug and Play devices, and wants you to finish the job. What should you do?</li></p>


<p><b>Explain to your boss that it is not a good idea to manually change or 
assign resource settings for Plug and Play devices. Windows 2000 arbitrates resources, but if you manually assign them, then Windows 2000 will not be able to arbitrate the assigned resources if requested by 
another Plug and Play device.</b></p>

<p>Once you have convinced your boss that this is not a good idea, start Device Manager. Plug and Play devices have a Resources tab on their Properties page. You can free the resource settings that were manually assigned and 
allow Windows 2000 to again arbitrate the resources by selecting the Use 
Automatic Settings check box on the Resources tab.</p>


<p><li> What benefits do you gain by Microsoft digitally signing all system files?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 drivers and operating system files are digitally signed 
by Microsoft to ensure the files have not been tampered with. Some 
applications overwrite existing operating files as part of their installation process. These files may cause system errors that are difficult to troubleshoot. Device Manager allows you to look at the Driver tab and verify that the digital signer of the installed driver is correct. This can save you many frustrating hours of trying to resolve problems caused by a file that replaced one or more original operating system drivers.</b></p>


<p><li> What are three ways Microsoft has provided to help you make sure the files on your system have the correct digital signature?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 provides Device Manager, which allows you to verify that the digital signer of the installed driver is correct. Windows 2000 also provides two utilities to verify the digital signatures. The first utility is the File Signature Verification utility, sigverif. Windows 2000 also provides System File Checker (SFC), a command-line utility that you can use to check the digital signature of files.</b></p>


<p><li> You receive a call at the Help desk from a user who is trying to configure their fax settings, and she tells you that she does not have an Advanced Options tab. What could the problem be?</li></p>



<p><b>For the Advanced Options tab to display, the user must be logged on as Administrator or have administrator privileges.</b></p>

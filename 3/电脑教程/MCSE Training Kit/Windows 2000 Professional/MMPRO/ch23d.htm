<A NAME="792"><H1>Lesson 3: Performing Remote Installations</H1></A>

<p>The most efficient method of deploying Windows 2000 Professional is to use 
remote installation. You can perform remote installations of Windows 2000 
Professional if you have a Windows 2000 Server infrastructure in place and the computers in your network support remote boot.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe how to deploy Windows 2000 using Remote Installation Services.</li></p>

<p><li>Install Remote Installation Services.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a boot floppy.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>To be able to install Remote Installation Services and to create a boot floppy for network interface cards that are not equipped with a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM, or for systems with BIOSs that don't support starting from the PXE boot ROM, you must have a computer running one 
of the Windows 2000 Server family of products. You must also have either the 
CD-ROM or access to a network source of files used to install the Server product. For more information, see the section &quot;<A HREF="ch23d.htm#795">Examining the Prerequisites</A>.&quot;</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="793"><H2>Understanding Remote Installation</H2></A>

<p><i>Remote installation</i> is the process of connecting to a server running Remote 
Installation Services, called the RIS server, and then starting an automated installation of Windows 2000 Professional on a local computer. Remote installation enables administrators to install Windows 2000 Professional on client computers throughout a network from a central location. This reduces the time administrators spend visiting all the computers in a network, thereby reducing the cost of deploying Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>RIS provides the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Enables remote installation of Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>

<p><li>Simplifies server image management by eliminating hardware-specific images and by detecting Plug and Play hardware during setup.</li></p>

<p><li>Supports recovery of the operating system and computer in the event of computer failure.</li></p>

<p><li>Retains security settings after restarting the destination computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Reduces TCO by allowing either users or technical staff to install the operating system on individual computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="794"><H2>Installing and Configuring Remote Installation Services</H2></A>

<p>Before beginning a rollout of Windows 2000 Professional using RIS, become 
familiar with the prerequisites for the service and install the service using the 
Remote Installation Services Setup wizard.</p>

<A NAME="795"><H3>Examining the Prerequisites</H3></A>

<p>RIS is available only on computers running one of the Windows 2000 Server family of products. The RIS server can be a domain controller or a member server. Table 23.2 lists the network services required for RIS and their RIS function. These network services don't have to be installed on the same computer as RIS, but they must be available somewhere on the network.</p>

<p><b>Table 23.2</b> <i>Network Services Required for RIS</i></p>
<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">
<tr>
<th>Network service</th>
<th>RIS function</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">DNS Service</td>
<td valign="top">RIS relies on the DNS server for locating both the directory 
 service and client computer accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">DHCP Service</td>
<td valign="top">Client computers that can perform a network boot receive an 
 IP address from the DHCP server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Active Directory directory services</td>
<td valign="top">RIS relies on the directory services based on Active Directory 
 technology in Windows 2000 for locating existing client 
 computers as well as existing RIS servers.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Remote installation requires that RIS (included on the Windows 2000 Server 
CD-ROM) be installed on a volume that is shared over the network. This shared volume must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The shared volume can't be on the same drive that is running Windows 2000 Server.</li></p>

<p><li>The shared volume must be large enough to hold the RIS software and the various Windows 2000 Professional images.</li></p>

<p><li>The shared volume must be formatted with the Microsoft Windows 2000 File System (NTFS).</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="796"><H3>Using the Remote Installation Services Setup Wizard</H3></A>

<p>When your network meets the prerequisites for RIS, you can run the Remote 
Installation Services Setup wizard, which does the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Installs the RIS software</li></p>

<p><li>Creates the remote installation folder and copies the Windows 2000 Professional installation files to the server</li></p>

<p><li>Adds .SIF files, which are a variation of an Unattend.txt file</li></p>

<p><li>Configures the Client Installation wizard screens that will appear during a remote installation</li></p>

<p><li>Updates the registry</li></p>

<p><li>Starts the required Remote Installation Services</li></p>
</ul>

<p>When installation of RIS is complete, you can configure it using the server's computer object in the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in. For more information on the management of Active Directory objects, see <A HREF="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A>, &quot;Introducing Active Directory Directory Services.&quot;</p>

<p>The RIS server stores the RIS images used to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional on client computers that are enabled for remote boot. The RIS server can be a domain controller or a stand-alone server that is a member of a domain containing Active Directory directory services.</p>

<A NAME="800"><H2>Understanding Client Requirements for Remote Installation</H2></A>

<p>Client computers that support remote installation must have one of the following configurations:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A configuration meeting the Net PC specification</li></p>

<p><li>A network interface card with a PXE boot ROM and BIOS support for starting from the PXE boot ROM</li></p>

<p><li>A supported network interface card and a remote installation boot disk</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="801"><H2>Net PCs</H2></A>

<p>The Net PC is a highly manageable platform with the ability to perform a network boot, manage upgrades, and prevent users from changing the hardware or operating system configuration. Additional requirements for the Net PC are the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The network adapter must be set as the primary boot device within the system BIOS.</li></p>

<p><li>The user account that will be used to perform the installation must be assigned the user right &quot;Log on as a batch job.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The Administrator group doesn't have the right to log on to a batch job by default and thus will need to be assigned this right prior to attempting a remote installation.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Users must be assigned permission to create computer accounts in the domain that they are joining. The domain is specified in the advanced settings on the RIS server.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="802"><H2>Computers Not Meeting the Net PC Specification</H2></A>

<p>Computers that don't directly meet the Net PC specification can still interact with the RIS server. You can enable remote installation on a computer that doesn't meet the Net PC specification by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Install a network interface card with a PXE boot ROM.</li></p>

<p><li> Set the BIOS to start from the PXE boot ROM.</li></p>

<p><li> Assign the user right &quot;Log on as a batch job&quot; to the user account that will be used to perform the installation.</li></p>

<p><li> Assign users permission to create computer accounts in the domain that they are joining. You specify the domain in the advanced settings on the RIS server.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="803"><H2>Creating Boot Floppies</H2></A>

<p>If the network interface card in a client isn't equipped with a PXE boot ROM or the BIOS doesn't allow starting from the network interface card, create a remote installation boot disk. The boot disk simulates the PXE boot process. Windows 2000 ships with the Windows 2000 Remote Boot Disk Generator that allows you to easily create a boot disk (see Figure 23.2).</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 23.2</b> <i>The Windows 2000 Remote Boot Disk Generator dialog box</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>You start the Windows 2000 Remote Boot Disk Generator by running Rbfg.exe. The Rbfg.exe file is located in the RemoteInstall\admin\i386 folder on the Remote Installation Server. These boot floppies support only the PCI-based network adapters listed in the Adapters List. To see the list of the supported network adapters, click the Adapter List button shown in Figure 23.2. A partial listing of the supported network adapter cards is shown in Figure 23.3.</p>

</p>

<p>You will also need to set the user rights and permissions. The user account that will be used to perform the installation must be assigned the user right &quot;Log 
on as a batch job.&quot; The users must be assigned permission to create computer 
accounts in the domain that they are joining. The domain is specified in the 
advanced settings on the RIS server.</p>

<A NAME="805"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that if you have a Windows 2000 Server infrastruc- 
ture in place, and the computers in your network support remote boot, the most 
efficient method of deploying Windows 2000 Professional is to use remote installation. Remote installation is the process of connecting to an RIS server and

This reduces the time that administrators spend visiting all the computers in a network, thereby reducing the cost of deploying Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>You also learned that client computers that support remote installation must have one of the three following configurations: a configuration meeting the Net PC specification, and the network interface card must be set as the primary boot 
device within the system BIOS; a network interface card with a PXE boot ROM and BIOS support for starting from the PXE boot ROM; or a supported network interface card and a remote installation boot disk.</p>

<p>Finally, you saw that the user account that will be used to perform the installation must be assigned the user right &quot;Log on as a batch job,&quot; and users must be 
assigned permission to create computer accounts in the domain that they are 
joining. The domain is specified in the advanced settings on the RIS server.</p>

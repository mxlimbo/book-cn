<A NAME="726"><H1>Lesson 3: Configuring Outbound Connections</H1></A>

<p>You can configure all outbound connections in Windows 2000 with the Network Connection wizard. Much of the work of configuring protocols and services is automated when you use this process. Understanding the options available in the wizard will help you to configure connections efficiently.</p>

<p>Three basic types of outbound connections exist:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Dial-up connections</li></p>

<p><li>Connections to a VPN</li></p>

<p><li>Direct connections to another computer through a cable</li></p>
</ul>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure outbound connections in Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="727"><H2>Dial-up Connections</H2></A>

<p>Dial-up connections include outbound dial-up connection to either a private network or to an ISP. To create and configure an outbound dial-up connection, use the Network Connection wizard. On the Network Connection Type page, select Dial-Up To Private Network to create a connection to a private network, or select Dial-Up To The Internet to create a connection to an ISP.</p>

<A NAME="728"><H3>The Dial-Up To A Private Network Option</H3></A>

<p>If you select the Dial-Up To Private Network option and click Next, you will be prompted to enter the phone number of the computer or network to which you want to connect; this can be an ISP for an Internet connection or the modems for your private network. Enter the phone number, click Next, and you will be prompted to specify who can use this connection. If you want this connection 
to be made available to all users of this computer, click For All Users, and then click Next. If you want to reserve the connection for yourself, click Only For Myself. When you click Next, you will be prompted to type a name for the connection. If you would like a shortcut to appear on your desktop, select the Add A Shortcut To My Desktop check box. Click Finish to create the connection.</p>

<A NAME="729"><H3>The Dial-Up To The Internet Option</H3></A>

<p>If you have selected the Dial-Up To The Internet option and then you click Next, the Welcome To The Internet Connection Wizard starts (see Figure 21.4). The wizard presents the following three options:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b> I Want To Sign Up For A New Internet Account.</b> If you select this option, the wizard will present a three-step procedure for choosing an ISP, specifying your address and billing information, and setting up your e-mail account.</li></p>

<p><li><b> I Want To Transfer My Existing Internet Account To This Computer.</b> If you already have an account with an ISP and have obtained all the necessary connection information, you can select this option to connect to your account using your phone line. If you select this option and click Next, you will be prompted to enter the telephone number you dial to connect to your ISP or the modem for your private network. To complete the wizard, you will be prompted for the user name and password that you use to log on to your ISP, and you will be prompted to type a name for the dial-up connection.</li></p>

<p><li><b> I Want To Set Up My Internet Account Manually, Or I Want To Connect Through A Local Area Network (LAN).</b> If you select this option, you have a choice of specifying that you connect to the Internet through a phone line and modem or through a LAN. You will be prompted for a proxy server and other settings.</li></p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>To configure Internet connection sharing, ensure that Enable Internet 
Connection Sharing For This Connection is selected on the Sharing tab of the connection's properties dialog box.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="730"><H2>Connections to a Virtual Private Network</H2></A>

<p>A VPN is a network that is created by using tunneling protocols such as PPTP or L2TP to create secure connections across an untrusted network. To create a new VPN connection, you also use the Network Connection wizard. On the Network Connection Type page, click Connect To A Private Network Through The Internet, click Next, and then do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you need to establish a connection with your ISP or some other network before connecting to the VPN, click Automatically Dial This Initial Connection, select a connection on the list, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>If you don't want to automatically establish an initial connection, click Do Not Dial The Initial Connection, and then click Next.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You will be prompted to type the host name or IP address of the computer or network to which you are connecting, and then click Next. If you want this connection to be made available to all users of this computer, click For All Users, and then click Next. If you want to reserve the connection for yourself, click Only For Myself. When you click Next, you will be prompted to type a name for the connection, and then click Finish. If you would like a shortcut to appear on your desktop, select the Add A Shortcut To My Desktop check box. Click Finish to create the connection.</p>

<A NAME="731"><H2>Direct Connections to Another Computer Through a Cable</H2></A>

<p>You can also use the Network Connection wizard to create a direct cable connection to another computer. On the Network Connection Type page, click Connect Directly To Another Computer, click Next, and then do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If your computer will be the host for the connection, click Host, and then click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>If your computer will be the guest for the connection, click Guest, and then click Next.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>After specifying Host or Guest, you select the port that is connected to the other computer and then click Next. You must specify the users who can access this connection and then click Next. You will be prompted to type a name for the connection. If you would like a shortcut to appear on your desktop, select the Add A Shortcut To My Desktop check box. Click Finish to create the connection.</p>

</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If your computer is on a network and there is a valid address that you can use to test your outbound connection, use that address instead of 192.168.1.202.

<ol>
<p><li value="8"> On the Connection Availability page, select Only For Myself, and click Next.</li></p>

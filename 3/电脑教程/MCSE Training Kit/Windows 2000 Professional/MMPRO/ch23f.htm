<p>With previous versions of Windows, you installed the Windows operating system and then applied each required service pack separately. Also, in the earlier versions of Windows, when service packs were applied to existing systems, many previously installed components had to be reinstalled. For example, applying a service pack to a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4 would cause 
services such as IPX or RAS to have to be reinstalled. Windows 2000 Professional eliminates the need to reinstall components after applying a service pack and allows you to apply a service pack at the same time that you install Windows 2000. This is one of the many ways that Windows 2000 reduces your TCO.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Deploy service packs.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 5 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="821"><H2>Slipstreaming Service Packs</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional supports service-pack slipstreaming, so service packs can be integrated with the Windows 2000 Professional installation files. This allows you to keep one master image of the operating system. When 
Windows 2000 Professional is installed from this master source, the appropriate files from the service pack are also installed. This saves you the time of having to manually apply service packs after each Windows 2000 installation.</p>

<p>To apply a new service pack, run Update.exe with the /slip switch. This will 
replace the existing Windows 2000 files with the appropriate files from the service pack. Some of the key Windows 2000 files that are replaced when you apply a service pack include the following: Layout.inf, Dosnet.inf, Txtsetup.sif, and if any drivers have changed, a new Driver.cab file.</p>

<A NAME="822"><H2>Deploying Service Packs After Installing Windows 2000</H2></A>

<p>To apply a service pack to a computer running Windows 2000, run Update.exe. Running Update.exe replaces the existing Windows 2000 files with the appropriate new files from the service pack.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of Windows, if you applied a service pack to your computer, each time you changed the system state by adding or removing services, you had to reapply any service packs. Windows 2000 automatically recognizes that a service pack has been applied to the system and which files have been replaced or updated. Whenever you add or remove services from a computer running Windows 2000, the system copies the required files from either the Windows 2000 installation 
files or from the service pack install location, so you don't have to reapply the 
service pack.</p>

<A NAME="823"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>As you learned in this lesson, Windows 2000 Professional simplifies the installation and maintenance of service packs and supports service-pack slipstreaming, so service packs can be integrated with the Windows 2000 installation files. As you install Windows 2000, the appropriate files from the service pack(s) are automatically applied during the installation.</p>

<p>This lesson also explained that when you apply a service pack to a computer running Windows 2000, and you later decide to add or remove services, you don't need to reapply the service pack. Windows 2000 automatically recognizes that a service pack has been applied to the system and copies the required files from either the Windows 2000 installation files or from the service pack install location. This frees you from having to reapply the service pack every time services are added or removed from a computer.</p>

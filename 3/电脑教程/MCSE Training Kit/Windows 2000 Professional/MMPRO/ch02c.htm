<ul>
<p><li>Run the Setup program.</li></p>

<p><li>Run the Setup wizard.</li></p>

<p><li>Install Windows networking.</li></p>

<p><li>Complete the Setup program.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>After you learn about these four stages, you will install Windows 2000 on your computer.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Install Windows 2000 Professional from a CD-ROM.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 90 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="71"><H2>The Windows 2000 Setup Program</H2></A>

<p>Installing Windows 2000 is a four-stage process (see Figure 2.4). You begin by running the Setup program that prepares the hard disk and copies files. Setup then runs a wizard that provides informational pages, which you use to complete the rest of the installation. The four stages of the installation process are described as follows:</p>

<!-- caption --><b>Figure 2.4</b> <i>Windows 2000 installation steps</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>Installing Windows 2000 from a CD-ROM to a clean hard disk consists of these four stages:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Run the Setup program.</li></p>

<p>The Setup program prepares the hard disk for later stages of the installation and copies the necessary files to run the Setup wizard. This is the text mode portion of setup.</p>

<p><li>Run the Setup wizard.</li></p>

<p>The Setup wizard requests setup information about the computer, which includes names, passwords, regional settings, and so on. This is the graphics mode portion of setup.</p>

<p><li>Install Windows networking.</li></p>

<p>After gathering information about the computer, the Setup wizard prompts you for networking information and then installs the networking components so that the computer can communicate with other computers on the network.</p>

<p><li>Complete the Setup program.</li></p>

<p>To complete the installation, Setup copies files to the hard disk, registers components, and configures the computer. The system restarts after installation is complete.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="72"><H2>Running the Setup Program</H2></A>

<p>To start Setup, use the Setup boot disks. Insert the disk labeled Setup Boot Disk (Disk 1) into drive A, and then turn on, or restart, the computer. If your computer supports booting from a CD-ROM drive, you can also start the installation by using the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.</p>

<p>The following steps describe running the Setup program on a clean disk drive. (See Figure 2.5.)</p>

<ol>
<p><li>After the computer starts, a minimal version of Windows 2000 is copied into memory. This version of Windows 2000 starts the Setup program.</li></p>

<p><li>Setup starts the text-based version of the Setup program. This version of Setup prompts you to read and accept a licensing agreement.</li></p>

<p><li>Setup prompts you to select the partition on which to install Windows 2000. You can select an existing partition or create a new partition by using unpartitioned space on the hard disk. You can even delete a partition, if necessary, to reconfigure the hard disk's partitions.</li></p>

<p><li>After you create the installation partition, Setup prompts you to select a file system for the new partition. Then Setup formats the partition with the selected file system.</li></p>

<p><li>After formatting the Windows 2000 partition, Setup copies files to the hard disk and saves configuration information.</li></p>

<p><li>Setup restarts the computer and then starts the Windows 2000 Setup wizard. By default, the Windows 2000 operating system files are installed in the C:\Winnt folder.</li></p>
</ol>

</p>

<A NAME="73"><H2>Running the Setup Wizard</H2></A>

<p>The graphical user interface (GUI)-based Windows 2000 Setup wizard leads you through the next stage of the installation process. It gathers information about you, your organization, and your computer.</p>

<p>After installing Windows 2000 security features and installing and configuring devices, the Windows 2000 Setup wizard asks you to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Regional settings.</b> Customize language, locale, and keyboard settings. You can configure Windows 2000 to use multiple languages and regional settings.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Name and organization.</b> Enter the name of the person and the organization to which this copy of Windows 2000 Professional is licensed.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Your Product Key.</b> Enter the 25-character Product Key that is on the sticker affixed to the back of your CD case.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Computer name.</b> Enter a computer name of up to 15 characters. The computer name must be different from other computer, workgroup, or domain names on the network. The Windows 2000 Setup wizard displays a default name, using the organization name that you entered earlier in the setup process.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Password for the Administrator account.</b> Specify a password for the Administrator user account, which the Windows 2000 Setup wizard creates during installation. The Administrator account provides administrative privileges that are required to manage the computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Modem dialing information.</b> Select the country or region where the computer is located. Often this is already completed, based on the selected regional setting. You also must enter the area (or city) for the computer's location as well as the number for obtaining an outside line, if relevant. Finally, select whether your phone system is tone dialing or pulse dialing.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
You won't be prompted to enter modem dialing information during installation if a modem isn't attached to the computer on which you are installing Windows 2000 Professional.
</blockquote></div></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Date and time settings.</b> If necessary, set the current date and time and select the correct time zone for your computer's location. These settings will most likely already be set correctly. You can also select whether to have Windows 2000 automatically adjust the computer's clock setting for daylight saving changes.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>After you complete this stage in the installation, the Windows 2000 Setup wizard starts to install the Windows networking components.</p>

<A NAME="74"><H2>Installing Windows Networking Components</H2></A>

<p>After gathering information about your computer, the Windows 2000 Setup program automatically installs the network software.</p>

<p>The following list describes the steps in which Windows 2000 Professional installs networking components:</p>

<ol>
<p><li><b>Detect network adapter cards.</b> The Windows 2000 Setup wizard detects and configures any network adapter cards that are installed on the computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Install networking components.</b> Windows 2000 installs (copies) files that allow your computer to connect to other computers, networks, and the Internet. Then the Setup program prompts you to choose whether to use typical settings or customized settings to configure the following networking components:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Client for Microsoft Networks.</b> This component allows your computer to gain access to network resources.</li></p>

<p><li><b>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.</b> This component allows other computers to gain access to file and print resources on your computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>TCP/IP.</b> This protocol is the default networking protocol that allows your computer to communicate over local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You can install other clients, services, and network protocols (such as NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface [NetBEUI], AppleTalk, and NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS-compatible transport) any time after you install Windows 2000.</p>

<p><li><b>Join a workgroup or domain.</b> If you create a computer account in the domain for your computer during the installation, the Windows 2000 Setup wizard prompts you for the name and password.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Install components.</b> The Windows 2000 Setup wizard installs and configures the Windows networking components that you selected.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="75"><H2>Completing the Installation</H2></A>

<p>After installing the networking components, the Windows 2000 Professional Setup wizard copies additional files to configure Windows 2000 Professional. Then the Setup program automatically starts the fourth step in the installation process to perform a set of final tasks. (See Figure 2.6.)</p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 2.6</b> <i>The final steps in completing the installation</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>The following list describes the tasks that Setup performs to complete the installation stage:</p>

<ol>
<p><li><b>Installs Start-menu items.</b> The Setup program sets up shortcuts that will appear on the Start menu.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Registers components.</b> Setup applies the configuration settings that you specified in the Windows 2000 Setup wizard.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Saves the configuration.</b> Setup saves your configuration settings to the local hard disk. The next time that you start Windows 2000, the computer will use this configuration automatically.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Removes temporary files.</b> To save hard disk space, Setup deletes any files that it installed for use only during installation.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Restarts the computer.</b> After completing the preceding steps, Setup restarts the computer. This finishes the installation of Windows 2000 Professional on a client or stand-alone system from a CD-ROM.</li></p>
</ol>

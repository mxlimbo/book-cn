<A NAME="1"><H1>About This Book</H1></A>

<p>Welcome to <i>MCSE Training Kit&#8212;Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional</i>. This 
kit introduces you to the Windows 2000 family of products and prepares you to install, configure, administer, and support Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>This kit introduces the various tools for administering and configuring Windows 2000 including the Microsoft Management Console, Task Scheduler, Control Panel, and the registry. You will learn about the network protocols and services that ship with Windows 2000. This kit concentrates on Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), the network protocol of choice for Windows 2000. It also introduces you to the Domain Name System (DNS), which is an Internet and TCP/IP standard name service, and is required for Windows 2000 domains and directory services based on Active Directory technology.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 domains and Active Directory directory services are also introduced in this course, but both these features are available only with the Windows 2000 Server family of products. Active Directory directory services integrate the Internet concept of a namespace with Windows 2000 directory service. Active Directory directory services use DNS as its domain naming and location service so Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS names. In fact, the core unit of logical structure in Active Directory directory services is the domain.</p>

<p>Each chapter in this book is divided into lessons. Most lessons include hands-on procedures that allow you to practice or demonstrate a particular concept or 
skill. Each lesson ends with a short summary and each chapter ends with a set 
of review questions to test your knowledge of the chapter material.</p>

<p>The &quot;<A HREF="abouta.htm#10">Getting Started</A>&quot; section of this chapter provides important setup instructions that describe the hardware and software requirements to complete the 
procedures in this course. It also provides information about the networking configuration necessary to complete some of the hands-on procedures. Read through this section thoroughly before you start the lessons.</p>

<p><li><A HREF="ch13a.htm">Chapter 13</A>, &quot;Administering Network Printers,&quot; presents the four major types of tasks involved with administering network printers: managing printers, managing documents, troubleshooting printers, and performing tasks that require the Manage Printers permission. This chapter also explains how Microsoft Windows 2000 allows you to control printer usage and administration by assigning permissions. In the hands-on practices, you assign forms to paper trays, set up a separator page, and take ownership of a printer. You also print a document, set a notification for a document, change the priority for a document, and then cancel a document.</li></p>


<p><li><A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Securing Resources with NTFS Permissions,&quot; introduces the NTFS folder and file permissions and explains how to assign them to user accounts and groups. It explains how moving or copying files and folders affects NTFS file and folder permissions. It also explains how to troubleshoot common resource access problems. In the hands-on practices, you plan and apply NTFS permissions for folders and files based on business scenarios, and then test them. You also observe the effects of taking ownership of a file, and determine the effects of permission and ownership when you copy or move files.</li></p>


<p><li><A HREF="ch15a.htm">Chapter 15</A>, &quot;Administering Shared Folders,&quot; explains how to share folders so that the folders and their contents are accessible over the network. This chapter also explains how sharing folders provides another way to secure file resources, one that can be used on FAT or FAT32 partitions. In the hands-on exercises, you share a folder, determine the current permissions for the shared folder and assign shared folder permissions to groups, and stop sharing a folder. In the optional hands-on exercises, you connect to a shared folder and test the combined effects of shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions.</li></p>


<p><li><A HREF="ch16a.htm">Chapter 16</A>, &quot;Auditing Resources and Events,&quot; introduces the Microsoft Windows 2000 Local Security Policy and Group Policy. One of the features controlled by Local Security Policy or Group Policy is auditing. Auditing is a tool for maintaining network security that allows you to track user activities and systemwide events. This chapter also introduces audit policies and what you need to consider before you set one up, as well as how to set up auditing on resources and how to maintain security logs. In the hands-on practices, you plan an audit policy for your computer, set up an audit policy by enabling auditing on certain events, view the security log file, and configure Event Viewer to overwrite events when the log file is filled.</li></p>


<p><li><A HREF="ch17a.htm">Chapter 17</A>, &quot;Configuring Group Policy and Local Security Policy,&quot; explains how to use the Windows 2000 Local Security Policy or Group Policy snap-in to improve the security on your computer.

<p><li><A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Managing Data Storage,&quot; introduces data storage management on NTFS-formatted volumes. Data management includes using compression, using disk quotas, increasing the security of files and folders on your computer by using the Encrypting File System (EFS), and defragmenting a disk. In the hands-on practice, you compress files and folders, display the compressed files and folders in a different color, uncompress a file, and test the effects that copying and moving files have on compression. You also configure default quota management settings to limit the amount of data users can store on a drive and configure a custom quota setting for a user account. You test the disk quota and then turn off quota management. Finally, you encrypt a file and then attempt to access it.</li></p>

<p><li><A HREF="ch19a.htm">Chapter 19</A>, &quot;Backing Up and Restoring Data,&quot; introduces the Windows Backup tool that allows you to back up and restore data. It explains the five types of backup&#8212;normal, copy, incremental, differential, and daily&#8212;and how these can be combined to meet your backup needs. In the hands-on practices, you use the Backup Wizard to back up some files to your hard disk, and you create a backup job to perform a backup operation later by using Task Scheduler. You then restore some of the files you backed up.</li></p>

<p><li><A HREF="ch20a.htm">Chapter 20</A>, &quot;Monitoring Access to Network Resources,&quot; prepares you to monitor network resources. You learn about the Shared Folders snap-in and how to use it to view and create shares.

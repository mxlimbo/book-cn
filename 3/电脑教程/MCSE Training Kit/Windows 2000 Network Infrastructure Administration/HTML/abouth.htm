<A NAME="18"><H3>Installing Windows 2000 Server</H3></A>

<p>To complete the exercises in this course, you should install Windows 2000 Server on a computer with no formatted partitions. During installation, you can use the Windows 2000 Server Setup program to create a partition on your hard disk, on which you install Windows 2000 Server as a stand-alone server in a workgroup.</p>

<p>Complete the following procedure on a computer running MS-DOS or any version of Windows with access to the Bootdisk directory on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM. If your computer is configured with a bootable CD-ROM drive, you can install Windows 2000 without using the Setup disks. To complete this exercise as outlined, bootable CD-ROM support must be disabled in the BIOS.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><HR>This procedure requires four formatted 1.44-MB disks. If you use diskettes that contain data, the data will be overwritten without warning.</blockquote></div></p>

<p><li><b>To create Windows 2000 Server Setup diskettes</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Label the four blank, formatted 1.44-MB diskettes as follows:</li></p>

<ul>

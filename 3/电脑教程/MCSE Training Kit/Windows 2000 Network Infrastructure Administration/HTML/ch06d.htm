<A NAME="262"><H1>Lesson 3: The Hosts File</H1></A>

<p>Now that you have learned the concepts of how host names are resolved using different methods, you will look at the HOSTS file. In this lesson, you modify the HOSTS file so that host names are resolved correctly.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure and use the HOSTS file</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="263"><H2>Understanding the Hosts File</H2></A>

<p>The HOSTS file is a static file used to map host names to IP addresses. This file provides compatibility with the UNIX HOSTS file. The HOSTS file is used by PING and other TCP/IP applications to resolve a host name to an IP address. The HOSTS file can be used to resolve NetBIOS names (Microsoft TCP/IP-32-specific).</p>

<p>A HOSTS file must reside on each computer. A single entry consists of an IP 
address corresponding to one or more host names. By default, the host name localhost is an entry in the HOSTS file. The HOSTS file is parsed whenever a host name is referenced. Names are read in a linear fashion. The most commonly used names should be near the beginning of the file.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>The HOSTS file can be edited with any text editor. It is located in the \systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc directory. Each host entry is limited to 255 characters, and entries in the HOSTS file are not case-sensitive.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Figure 6.4 shows an example of the contents of the HOSTS file.</p>

<p>Within the HOSTS file</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Multiple host names can be assigned to the same IP address. Note that the server at the IP address 172.16.94.97 can be referred to by its fully qualified domain name (rhino.microsoft.com) or a nickname (rhino). This allows the user at this computer to refer to this server using the nickname rhino rather than typing the entire FQDN.</li></p>

<p><li>Entries can be case-sensitive depending on the platform. Entries in the HOSTS file for some UNIX operating systems are case-sensitive. Entries in the HOSTS file for Windows 2000 and Windows 2000-based computers are not case-sensitive.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="264"><H2>Advantage of Using a Hosts File</H2></A>

<p>The advantage of using a HOSTS file is that it is customizable for the user. Each user can create whatever entries he or she wants, including easy-to-remember nicknames for frequently accessed resources. However, the individual maintenance of the HOSTS file does not scale well to storing large numbers of FQDN mappings.</p>

<A NAME="265"><H2>Practice: Working with the HOSTS File and DNS</H2></A>

<p>In this procedure, you configure and use the HOSTS file, configure Windows 2000 to use DNS, and identify problems associated with host name and domain name resolution. In the first part of the procedure, you add host name/IP address mappings to your HOSTS file and then use the file to resolve host names.</p>

<p>In this procedure, you determine the local host used for TCP/IP applications, such as PING.</p>

<p><li><b>To determine the local host name</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open a command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>Type <b>hostname</b> and then press the Enter key.</li></p>

<p>The local host name is displayed.</p>
</ol>

<p>In this procedure, you PING the name of the local host to verify that your system can resolve local host names without entries in the HOSTS file.</p>

<p><li><b>To ping your local host name</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Type <b>ping Server1</b> (where Server1 is the name of your computer) and then press the Enter key.</li></p>

<p>What was the response?</p>
</ol>


<p>Perform the following procedure from Server1 to attempt to ping a local 
computer name.</p>

<p><li><b>To ping a local computer name</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Type <b>ping computertwo</b> and then press the Enter key.</li></p>

<p>What was the response?</p>
</ol>


<p><li><b>To add an entry to the HOSTS file on Server1</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Change to the following directory by typing:</li></p>
<p><b>cd %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc</b></p>

<p><li>Use a text editor to modify a file called HOSTS by typing:</li></p>

<p><b>notepad hosts</b></p>

<p><li>Add an entry in the HOSTS file for computertwo. This will be the IP address, followed by a space, and then the host name.</li></p>

<p><li>Save the file, then exit Edit.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To use the HOSTS file for name resolution</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Type <b>ping computertwo</b> and then press the Enter key.</li></p>

<p>What was the response?</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="266"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The HOSTS file is a text file that you can edit with any text editor (such as Notepad). The HOSTS file maps host names to IP addresses and provides 
compatibility with the UNIX HOSTS file. If your network uses HOSTS files for host name resolution and you cannot connect to the other computer using its host name, there may be an invalid entry in your HOSTS file. Search your HOSTS file for the host name of the other computer, verify that there is only one entry per host name, and then verify that the entry for the host name of the other 
computer is valid. For more information on the HOSTS file, see the sample HOSTS file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.</p>

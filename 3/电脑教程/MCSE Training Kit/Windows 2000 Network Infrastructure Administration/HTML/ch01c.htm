<A NAME="47"><H2>Operating System Considerations</H2></A>

<p>When planning your Windows 2000 network, you should consider operating systems based on the needs of your users and business requirements. For example, if your network servers run demanding memory- and processor-intensive applications, implementing a Windows 2000 Advanced Server is your best choice. You should review specific Windows 2000 technology features to determine which technologies are most important for your organization, while considering your organization's short-term, mid-term, and long-term objectives. The following sections describe the different Windows 2000 operating systems.</p>

<A NAME="48"><H3>Windows 2000 Professional</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is a desktop operating system that provides advanced features of Windows NT, including security and fault tolerance, with the easy- 
to-use features of Windows 98, including plug and play and device support. 
Windows 2000 Professional can be upgraded from Windows NT Workstation 3.51 and greater, or Windows 98. The minimum system requirements for running Windows 2000 Professional include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>133 MHz or higher Pentium-compatible CPU.</b> Windows 2000 Professional supports single and dual CPU systems.</li></p>

<p><li><b>64 megabytes (MB) of RAM.</b> More memory generally improves responsiveness.</li></p>


<p><li><b>2 GB hard disk.</b> Your hard disk must have a minimum of 650 MB of free space to install Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="49"><H3>Windows 2000 Server</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Server builds on the powerful features of the Windows NT Server 4.0 operating system. Windows 2000 Server integrates standards-based directory, Web, application, communications, file, and print services with high reliability, efficient management, and support for the latest advances in networking hardware to provide the best foundation for integrating your business with the Internet. These features include:</p>

<p><li>Network (TCP/IP) Load Balancing</li></p>

<p><li>Up to 8 GB main memory on Intel Page Address Extension (PAE) systems</li></p>

<p><li>Support of up to eight processors</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Be sure to schedule enough time to install a Windows 2000 server, as it can take several hours.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="51"><H3>Windows 2000 Datacenter Server</H3></A>

<p>Another Windows 2000 operating system that builds upon the features of 
Windows 2000 Advanced Server is the Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, which supports 32 processors and more RAM than the other Windows 2000 Server 
operating systems. Physical memory support includes</p>

<ul>
<p><li>32 GB of RAM on Alpha-based computers</li></p>

<p><li>64 GB of RAM on Intel-based computers</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Consider installing Windows 2000 Datacenter Server if you must support intensive online transaction processing (OLTP), large data warehouses, and large Internet and application service providers (ISPs and ASPs).</p>

<A NAME="52"><H2>Phases of Deployment</H2></A>

<p>The purpose of your Windows 2000 network planning process is to ensure that your network performs the required activities. When planning your Windows 2000 network deployment, you should follow a process, or life cycle. The phases of this project life cycle should include the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li><b>Analysis.</b> During the analysis phase, determine IT goals and objectives. This will help you to design a network to support bandwidth, meet security needs, measure cost versus benefits, and provide deliverables appropriate to your organization.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Design.</b> During the design phase, evaluate the Windows 2000 Infrastructure design. This includes features such as DNS, WINS, DHCP, and network protocols. Your design will be based on your analysis, interoperability issues, and desired features.</li></p>


<p><li><b>Testing.</b> During the testing phase, conduct a pilot project to test the Windows 2000 network you designed in a production environment with a low number of users. You might have to adjust your designs based upon pilot-testing results to achieve a completely functional and stable network environment.</li></p>


<p><li><b>Production.</b> The production phase is the final phase of Windows 2000 deployment. The network has been tested using the pilot program based on your designs, and you are ready to deploy Windows 2000 throughout your enterprise. During this phase, create a disaster recovery plan and provide training material for user and helpdesk personnel.</li></p>

</ol>

<A NAME="53"><H2>Hardware Considerations</H2></A>

<p>Compatibility issues with devices and programs can compromise reliability and quality. You can check hardware and software compatibility with Windows 2000 at <i><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/default.asp" TARGET="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/default.asp</A></i>.</p>

<p>Before deploying Windows 2000, you should record hardware and software 
inventories of all servers and client computers in use on your network, and 
include basic input/output system (BIOS) settings. You should also record the configuration of peripheral devices, driver versions, service packs, and other software and firmware information. In addition, establish standard configurations for your clients and servers. This includes guidelines for minimum and recommended values for CPU, RAM, hard disks, and accessories such as CD-ROM drives and uninterruptible power supplies.</p>

<p>Make sure that network devices, such as hubs and cabling, are fast enough for your needs. If your organization transfers voice and video over your network, the cabling and switches must be capable of handling the bandwidth demand of those services. Some remote users do not generate much network traffic. For 
example, a remote user who works with Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel files does not generate as much network traffic to a routing and remote access server as databases and accounting systems. Therefore, a Category 3 10-Mbps cable matched with the same speed hubs might be acceptable for some situations, whereas Category 5 100-Mbps devices and cabling might be required for applications generating considerably more network traffic. Try to record available bandwidth during the course of low, normal, and high network utilization.</p>

<A NAME="54"><H2>Interaction with Legacy Systems</H2></A>

<p>Many networks are heterogeneous, which means that there are a mix of operating systems and network protocols. For example, your Windows 2000 computers might interact with mainframe hosts, UNIX systems, or other network operating systems. You should concentrate on the interoperability issues that are most 
important to your organization during planning.</p>

<p>In addition, Windows 2000 Server offers gateway services to other operating 
systems allowing you to access network resources. Gateway Service for NetWare, for example, allows your Windows 2000 network clients to navigate Novell 
Directory Services (NDS) hierarchies, use Novell version 4.2 or later logon scripts, and authenticate with a Novell server.</p>

<A NAME="55"><H2>Network Protocol Considerations</H2></A>

<p>Some networks use a variety of protocols based on their needs. For example, a small Ethernet network could use NetBEUI as the LAN protocol, while using TCP/IP for Internet connectivity. In addition, networks that include both Novell NetWare and Windows NT servers might use both IPX/SPX and TCP/IP. Always identify the protocols in use on your current network, and consider whether any of these protocols can be replaced or eliminated by Windows 2000. For example, if you upgrade clients that use IPX/SPX with Windows 2000 Professional, it's possibe to eliminate the use of IPX/SPX on your network.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 contains a TCP/IP protocol suite with more functionality than previous versions of Windows. You must use TCP/IP to use Active Directory and to utilize advanced features of Windows 2000; therefore, you should consider simplifying your network by using only TCP/IP.</p>

<p>You can obtain network settings and protocol information in Windows NT by right-clicking on the My Network Places icon on your desktop and choosing Properties.</p>

<A NAME="56"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You should plan your deployment carefully to obtain the greatest benefit from Windows 2000, and be aware of the different Windows 2000 operating systems. An enterprise network deployment consists of different phases of a project life cycle: analysis, design, testing, and production. Before deploying Windows 2000, record hardware and software inventories of all servers and client computers in use on your network. Additionally, consider interoperability issues and decide which protocols best meet your needs.</p>

<A NAME="143"><H1>Lesson 3: Using Client Service for NetWare</H1></A>

<p>Microsoft network clients can access the NetWare server through the 
Windows 2000 server running Gateway Service for NetWare. A Windows 2000-based computer can access resources on the NetWare server as a client through the integrated Client Service for NetWare component. In this lesson, you will learn how to install and use the Client Service for NetWare.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote><b>
After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Install Client Service for NetWare</li></p>

<p><li>List advantages and disadvantages of using Client Service for Netware</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="144"><H2>NetWare Connectivity</H2></A>

<p>Client Service for NetWare provides client-based NetWare connectivity, and Gateway Service for NetWare acts as a gateway through which multiple clients can access NetWare resources. Both depend on and work with the NWLink 
protocol, which is automatically installed with the redirector. Client Service for NetWare uses a subset of Gateway Service for NetWare code.</p>

<p>When a drive is mapped to a NetWare volume, the computer running 
Windows 2000 Professional uses a NetWare account to create a validated 
connection to the NetWare server. For example, it would be used to create a connection from computer A (running Client Service) to the Novell NDS volume \\T\Volname.Orgunit.Org\Folder, where T is the name of the Novell NDS tree, Volname.Orgunit.Org is the path to the volume name in the Novell NDS tree, and Folder is a subfolder on the Volname volume. In Windows Explorer, select Tools, then click Map Network Drive. You can also use the net use command line utility and specify the path \\B\Volname.Orgunit.Org\Folder for the NetWare resource. When using the net use command, after the mapped connection is established, it is disconnected only if the computer running Windows 2000 Professional is shut down, if the drive is manually disconnected, or if a network problem prevents access to the NetWare server. The mapped drive is then reestablished when the user logs on to the network.</p>

<A NAME="145"><H3>Choosing Between Client Service for NetWare and Gateway Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>If you intend to create or indefinitely maintain a heterogeneous environment 
containing both servers running Windows 2000 and servers running NetWare, consider using Client Service for NetWare. If you intend to migrate gradually from NetWare to Windows 2000 or if you want to reduce administration, 
consider using Gateway Service for NetWare.</p>

<A NAME="146"><H3>Advantages of Client Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>Client Service provides the following advantages over Gateway Service:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Client Service allows for user-level security rather than share-level security.</b> With Client Service for NetWare, you can allow users access to individual user home directories (directories where individual user data resides) that are stored on NetWare volumes. Users can then map to their home directories and any additional volumes to which they have been granted user-level security. To allow users access to individual home directories with Gateway Service, you need to give each user a separate drive letter.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Client Service performs better than Gateway Service.</b> Client Service communicates directly with NetWare servers, avoiding latency caused by requests moving through a Gateway Service for NetWare server.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="147"><H3>Disadvantages of Client Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>Client Service has the following disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Client Service requires you to manage multiple user accounts for each user.</b> For each user, you must create and manage separate user accounts for both Windows 2000 and NetWare. However, you do not need to do so if you are using an additional product, such as Novell Client for Windows 2000. In Windows NT 4.0, Directory Service Manager eliminates the need to create separate user accounts on bindery-based servers.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Client Service requires more installation and management overhead.</b> With Client Service, you must install and maintain additional Client Service software on each computer running Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Client Service requires you to add IPX to your entire network.</b> Servers running Windows 2000 and servers running NetWare 5.0 use TCP/IP as the native protocol. However, Client Service requires you to use IPX (through NWLink), and may require enabling IPX routing throughout the entire network.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="148"><H2>Configuring Client Service for NetWare</H2></A>

<p>When you install Client Service for NetWare on Windows 2000 Professional, 
the NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol is automatically 
installed. To install Client Service for NetWare, you need Administrator rights to the computer running Windows 2000 Professional. Microsoft Unattended Setup Mode can be used for large deployments of Windows 2000 Professional and 
Client Service for NetWare. Refer to the Custom and Automated Installations in this book for more information.</p>

<p><li><b>To install Client Service for NetWare</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Network and Dial-Up Connections Control Panel applet.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click the local area connection for which you want to install Client Service for NetWare, then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the General tab, click Install.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click Client, then click Add.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Client Service For NetWare, then click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="149"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 includes client software to support connections to servers running NetWare. With the Client Service for NetWare in Windows 2000 and the Gateway Service for NetWare in Windows 2000 Server, users can use file and print 
resources on servers running NetWare.</p>

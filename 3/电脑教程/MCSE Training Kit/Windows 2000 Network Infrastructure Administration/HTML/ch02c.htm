<A NAME="87"><H1>Lesson 2: Internet Protocol Addressing</H1></A>

<p>A unique IP address is required for each host and network component that communicates using TCP/IP. TCP/IP networks are usually categorized into three main classes that have predefined sizes. Each network can be divided into smaller 
subnetworks by system administrators by using a subnet mask to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs. Each TCP/IP host is identified by a logical IP address. The IP address is a network layer address and has no dependence on the data-link layer address (such as a media access control address of a network interface card). In this lesson, you will learn how IP addressing works in a TCP/IP network.</p>

<A NAME="88"><H2>The IP Address</H2></A>

<p>An IP address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a host (computer or other device, such as a printer or router) on a TCP/IP network. IP addresses are normally expressed in dotted-decimal format, with four numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.123.132.</p>

<p>For a TCP/IP WAN to work efficiently as a collection of networks, the routers that pass packets of data between networks do not need to know the exact location of a host for which a packet of information is destined. Routers only know what network the host is a member of and use information stored in their route table to determine how to get the packet to the destination host's network. After the packet is delivered to the destination's network, the packet is delivered to the appropriate host. For this process to work, an IP address has two parts: a network ID and a host ID.</p>

<A NAME="89"><H3>The Network ID</H3></A>

<p>The network ID identifies the TCP/IP hosts that are located on the same physical network. All hosts on the same physical network must be assigned the same network ID to communicate with each other. If routers connect your networks, as illustrated in Figure 2.2, a unique network ID is required for each wide area 
connection. For example, in the following illustration:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Networks 1 and 2 represent two routed networks.</li></p>

<p><li>Network 3 represents the WAN connection between the routers.</li></p>

<p><li>Network 3 requires a network ID so that the interfaces between the two routers can be assigned unique host IDs.</li></p>

</ul>

This will guarantee IP network ID uniqueness. For domain name registration and IP network number assignment, contact your Internet service provider.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="90"><H3>The Host ID</H3></A>

<p>The host ID identifies a host within a network. The host ID must be unique to 
the network designated by the network ID. An IP address identifies a system's location on the network in the same way a street address identifies a house on a city block, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.</p>

<A NAME="91"><H2>Dotted Decimal Notation</H2></A>

<p>There are two formats for referencing an IP address&#8212;binary and dotted decimal notation. As illustrated in Figure 2.4, each IP address is 32 bits long and is 
composed of four 8-bit sections. These 8-bit sections are known as octets. The example IP address 192.168.123.132 becomes 11000000.10101000.01111011. 10000100 in binary format. The decimal numbers separated by periods in the dotted decimal notation are the octets converted from binary to decimal notation. The octets represent a decimal number ranging from zero to 255, and the entire 32 bits of the IP address are allocated to the network and host IDs as illustrated in Figure 2.4.</p>

</p>

<A NAME="92"><H2>IP Address Conversion from Binary to Decimal</H2></A>

<p>To administer TCP/IP on your network, you should be able to convert bit values in an octet from binary code to a decimal format. In binary format, each bit in an octet has an assigned decimal value. A bit that is set to 0 always has a zero value, and a bit that is set to 1 can be converted to a decimal value. The low-order bit represents a decimal value of one. The high-order bit represents a decimal value of 128. The highest decimal value of an octet is 255&#8212;that is, when all bits are set to 1, as illustrated in Figure 2.5.</p>

<A NAME="93"><H2>Address Classes</H2></A>

<p>Internet addresses are allocated by the InterNIC (<i><A HREF="http://www.internic.net" TARGET="_window2">http://www.internic.net</A></i>), the organization that administers the Internet. These IP addresses are divided into classes. The most common of these are Classes A, B, and C. Classes D and E 
exist, but are not generally used by end users. Each of the address classes has a different default subnet mask. You can identify the class of an IP address by looking at its first octet. Following are the ranges of Class A, B, and C Internet addresses, each with an example address:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Class A addresses are assigned to networks with a very large number of hosts. Class A networks use a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and have 0-126 as their first octet. The address 10.52.36.11 is a Class A address. Its first octet is 10, which is between 1 and 126, inclusive.</li></p>

<p><li>Class B addresses are assigned to medium-sized to large-sized networks. Class B networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and have 128-191 as their first octet. The address 172.16.52.63 is a Class B address. Its first octet is 172, which is between 128 and 191, inclusive.</li></p>

<p><li>Class C addresses are used for small LANs. Class C networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and have 192-223 as their first octet. The address 192.168.123.132 is a Class C address. Its first octet is 192, which is between 192 and 223, inclusive.</li></p>

</ul>



<p>The class of address defines which bits are used for the network ID and which bits are used for the host ID, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. The class also defines the possible number of networks and the number of hosts per network.</p>

<A NAME="94"><H2>IP Address Guidelines</H2></A>

<p>Although there are no rules for how to assign IP addresses, be sure to assign valid network IDs and host IDs. There are several general guidelines you should follow when assigning network IDs and host IDs:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The network ID cannot be 127. This ID is reserved for loopback and diagnostic functions.</li></p>

<p><li>The network ID and host ID bits cannot all be &quot;1&quot;s. If all bits are set to 1, the address is interpreted as a broadcast rather than a host ID.</li></p>

<p><li>The network ID and host ID bits cannot all be &quot;0&quot;s. If all bits are set to 0, the address is interpreted to mean &quot;this network only.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>The host ID must be unique to the local network ID.</li></p>

<p><li>A unique network ID is required for each network and wide area connection. If you are connecting to the public Internet, you are required to obtain a network ID.</li></p>

<p><li>All TCP/IP hosts, including interfaces to routers, require unique host IDs. The host ID of the router is the IP address configured as a workstation's default gateway.</li></p>


<p><li>Each host on a TCP/IP network requires a subnet mask&#8212;either a default subnet mask, which is used when a network is not divided into subnets, or a custom subnet mask, which is used when a network is divided into subnets. A subnet mask is a 32-bit address used to block or &quot;mask&quot; a portion of the IP address to distinguish the network ID from the host ID. This is necessary so that TCP/IP can determine whether an IP address is located on a local or remote network. The default subnet mask you use depends on the address class, as illustrated in Figure 2.8.</li></p>

<A NAME="95"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Each TCP/IP host is identified by a logical IP address, and a unique IP address is required for each host and network component that communicates using TCP/IP. Each IP address defines the network ID and host ID. An IP address is 32 bits long and is composed of four 8-bit fields, called octets. There are five address classes. Microsoft supports Class A, B, and C addresses assigned to hosts. Each address class can accommodate networks of different sizes.</p>

<p>There are several guidelines you should follow to make sure you assign valid 
IP addresses. All hosts on a given network must have the same network ID to communicate with each other. All TCP/IP hosts, including interfaces to routers, 
require unique host IDs.</p>

<A NAME="250"><H1>Lesson 1: TCP/IP Naming Schemes</H1></A>

<p>When computers connect and share data across a TCP/IP network, they use the specific, assigned IP address that is associated with their host. However, network users can remember text-based names easier than IP addresses. For example, it is much easier for users to remember <i>www.microsoft.com</i> than the specific IP address 
associated with this web site. Although TCP/IP hosts require an IP address to communicate, hosts can be referenced by a name rather than an IP address. 
Because text-based names can be used as aliases for IP addresses, a mechanism must exist for assigning those names to the appropriate IP node. This ensures the name's uniqueness and resolution to its IP address.</p>

<A NAME="251"><H2>Windows 2000 Naming Schemes</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 provides several different types of name resolution, including DNS, WINS, broadcast name resolution, and name resolution using HOSTS or LMHOSTS files. Different naming schemes are used by Microsoft Windows 2000 and other hosts such as UNIX. A Windows 2000 host can be assigned a host name, but the host name is used only with TCP/IP applications. UNIX hosts require only an IP address. Using a host or domain name to communicate is optional.</p>

<p>Before communication can take place, an IP address is required on each TCP/IP host. However, the naming scheme affects the way a host is referenced; for example:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>To perform a NET USE command between two computers running Windows 2000, a user has several choices for how to specify the computer's name.</li></p>

<p>Any of the following three methods can work:</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p>net use x: \\netbios_name\share </p>

<p>net use x: \\10.1.3.74\share</p>

<p>net use x: \\host.domain.com\share</p>


<p>The NetBIOS name or the host name must be resolved to an IP address before Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) can resolve the IP address to a hardware address. If an IP address is used, no name resolution is required.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><li>To reference a UNIX host running TCP/IP, a user specifies either the IP address or the host name. If a host name is used, the name is resolved to an IP address. If the IP address is used, name resolution is not necessary and the IP address is resolved to a hardware address.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="252"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 and UNIX hosts can both be referenced by either an IP address or host name. Windows 2000 and other Microsoft network operating systems also allow naming using a NetBIOS name.</p>

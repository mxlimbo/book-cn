is included in the Macintosh operating system software. It is a collection of protocols that 
correspond to the OSI model. Thus, network 
capabilities are built into every Macintosh. AppleTalk protocols support LocalTalk, Ethernet (EtherTalk), and Token Ring (TokenTalk).</p>

<p><a name="721"></a><b>AppleTalk filing protocol (AFP)</b> Describes how files are stored and accessed on the network. AFP is responsible for the Apple hierarchical filing structure of volumes, folders, and files and 
provides for file sharing between Macintoshes and MS-DOS-based computers. It provides an interface for communication between AppleTalk and other network operating systems, allowing Macintoshes to be integrated into any network that uses an operating system that recognizes AFP.</p>

<p><a name="722"></a><b>application programming interface (API)</b> A set 
of routines that an application program uses to request and carry out lower-level services 
performed by the operating system.</p>

<p><a name="723"></a><b>ArcNet (Attached Resource Computer Network)</b> Developed by Datapoint Corporation in 1977, designed as a baseband, token-passing, bus architecture, transmitting at 2.5 Mbps. A successor to the original ArcNet, ArcNetplus supports data transmission rates of 20 Mbps. A simple, 
inexpensive, flexible network architecture 
designed for workgroup-sized LANs, ArcNet runs on coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cable and supports up to 255 nodes. ArcNet 
technology predates IEEE Project 802 standards but loosely maps to the 802.4 document. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#852">IEEE Project 802.</a></p>

<p><a name="724"></a><b>ARP</b> <i>See</i> <a href="glossa.htm#708">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).</a></p>

<p><a name="725"></a><b>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)</b> A pioneering wide area network (WAN) commissioned by the Department of 
Defense, ARPANET was designed to facilitate the exchange of information between universities and other research organizations. ARPANET, which became operational in the 1960s, is the network from which the Internet evolved.</p>

<p><a name="726"></a><b>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</b> A coding scheme that assigns 
numeric values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and certain other characters. By standardizing the values used for these characters, ASCII enables computers and computer programs to 
exchange information.</p>

<p><a name="727"></a><b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b> A 
recent modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications. These new connections can transmit more than 8 Mbps to the subscriber and up to 1 Mbps from the subscriber. ADSL is recognized as a physical layer transmission protocol for unshielded twisted-pair media.</p>

<p><a name="728"></a><b>asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</b> An advanced implementation of packet switching that provides high-speed data transmission rates to send fixed-size cells over LANs or WANs. Cells are 53 bytes&#8212;48 bytes of data with 5 additional bytes 
of address. ATM accommodates voice, data, fax, real-time video, CD-quality audio, imaging, and multimegabit data transmission. ATM uses switches as multiplexers to permit several computers to put data on a network simultaneously. Most commercial ATM implementations transmit data at about 155 Mbps, but theoretically a rate of 1.2 gigabits per second is possible.</p>

<p><a name="729"></a><b>asynchronous transmission</b> A form of data 
transmission in which information is sent one character at a time, with variable time intervals between characters. Asynchronous transmission does not rely on a shared timer that allows the sending and receiving units to separate characters by specific time periods. Therefore, each transmitted character consists of a number of data bits (that compose the character itself), preceded by 
a start bit and ending in an optional parity bit 
followed by a 1-, 1.5-, or 2-stop bit.</p>

<p><a name="730"></a><b>ATM</b> <i>See</i> <a href="glossa.htm#728">asynchronous transfer mode (ATM).</a></p>

<p><a name="731"></a><b>attenuation</b> The weakening or degrading 
(distorting) of a transmitted signal as it travels farther from its point of origin. This could be a digital signal on a cable or the reduction in 
amplitude of an electrical signal, without the 
appreciable modification of the waveform. 
Attenuation is usually measured in decibels. 
Attenuation of a signal transmitted over a long cable is corrected by a repeater, which amplifies and cleans up an incoming signal before sending it farther along the cable.</p>

<p><a name="732"></a><b>auditing</b> A process that tracks network activities by user accounts and a routine element of network security. Auditing can produce records of list users who have accessed&#8212;or attempted to access&#8212;specific resources; help administrators identify unauthorized activity; and track activities such as logon attempts, connection and disconnection from designated resources, changes made to files and directories, server events and modifications, password changes, and logon parameter changes.</p>

<p><a name="733"></a><b>authentication</b> Verification typically based on user name, password, and time and account 
restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="734"></a><b>authorization</b> A process that verifies that the user has the correct rights or permissions to access a resource.</p>

<A NAME="676"><H3>B</H3></A>

<p><a name="735"></a><b>backbone</b> The main cable, also known as the trunk segment, from which transceiver cables connect to computers, repeaters, and bridges.</p>

<p><a name="736"></a><b>back end</b> In a client/server application, the part of the program that runs on the server.</p>

<p><a name="737"></a><b>backup domain controller (BDC)</b> In a Windows NT Server domain, a computer that receives a copy of the domain's security policy and domain database and authenticates network logons. It provides a backup if the primary domain controller (PDC) becomes unavailable. A domain is not 
required to have a BDC, but it is recommended 
to have a BDC to back up the PDC. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#799">domain</a>, <a href="glossa.htm#800">domain controller</a>, <a href="glossa.htm#933">primary domain 
controller (PDC)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="738"></a><b>bandwidth</b> In communications, the difference 
between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given range. For example, a telephone accommodates a bandwidth of 3000 Hz, or the difference between the lowest (300 Hz) and highest (3300 Hz) frequencies it can carry. In computer 
networks, greater bandwidth indicates faster or greater data-transfer capability.</p>

<p><a name="739"></a><b>baseband</b> A system used to transmit the encoded signals over cable. Baseband uses digital signaling over a single frequency. Signals flow in the 
form of discrete pulses of electricity or light. With baseband transmission, the entire 
communication-channel capacity is used to 
transmit a single data signal.</p>

<p><a name="740"></a><b>basic input/output system (BIOS)</b> On PC-compatible computers, the set of essential 
software routines that test hardware at startup, start the operating system, and support the 
transfer of data among hardware devices. The BIOS is stored in read-only memory (ROM) so that it can be executed when the computer is turned on. Although critical to performance, the BIOS is usually invisible to computer users.</p>

<p><a name="741"></a><b>baud</b> A measure of data-transmission speed named after the French engineer and telegrapher Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. It is a measure of the speed of oscillation of the sound wave on which a bit of data is carried over telephone lines. Because baud was originally used to measure the transmission speed of telegraph equipment, the term sometimes refers to the data-transmission speed of a modem. However, current modems can send at a speed higher than 1 bit per oscillation, so baud is being replaced by the more accurate bps (bits per second) as a measure of modem speed.</p>

<p><a name="742"></a><b>baud rate</b> Refers to the speed at which a modem can transmit data. Often confused with bps (the number of bits per second transmitted), baud rate actually measures the number of events, or signal changes, that occur in one second. Because one event can actually encode more than one bit in high-speed digital communication, baud rate and bps are not always synonymous, and the latter is the more accurate term to apply to modems. For example, the 9600-baud modem that encodes 4 bits per event actually operates at 2400 baud, but transmits at 9600 bps (2400 events times 4 bits per event), and thus should be called a 9600-bps modem.</p>

<p><a name="743"></a><b>BDC</b> <i>See</i> <a href="glossa.htm#737">backup domain controller (BDC).</a></p>

<p><a name="744"></a><b>bind</b> To associate two pieces of information with one another.</p>

<p><a name="745"></a><b>binding</b> A process that establishes the communication channel between a protocol driver and a NIC driver.</p>

Digital Network (BISDN)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="748"></a><b>bisync (binary synchronous communications protocol)</b> A communications protocol developed by IBM. Bisync transmissions are encoded in 
either ASCII or EBCDIC. Messages can be of any length and are sent in units called frames, optionally preceded by a message header. Because bisync uses synchronous transmission, in which message elements are separated by a specific time interval, each frame is preceded and followed by special characters that enable the sending and 
receiving machines to synchronize their clocks.</p>

<p><a name="749"></a><b>bit</b> Short for binary digit: either 1 or 0 in the 
binary number system. In processing and storage, a bit is the smallest unit of information handled by a computer. It is represented physically by an element such as a single pulse sent through a 
circuit or small spot on a magnetic disk capable of storing either a 1 or 0. Eight bits make a byte.</p>

<p><a name="750"></a><b>bits per second (bps)</b> A measure of the speed at which a device can transfer data. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#742">baud rate.</a></p>

receive and store a bit.</p>

<p><a name="752"></a><b>boot</b> <b>partition</b> The partition that contains the Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system and its support files. The boot partition can be, but does not have to be, the same as the system partition.</p>

<p><a name="753"></a><b>bottleneck</b> The limiting factor when analyzing performance of a system or network. Poor 
performance results when a device uses noticeably more CPU time than it should, consumes too much of a resource, or lacks the capacity to handle the load. Potential bottlenecks can be found in the CPU, memory, NIC, and other components.</p>

<p><a name="754"></a><b>bps</b> <i>See</i> <a href="glossa.htm#750">bits per second (bps).</a></p>

<p><a name="755"></a><b>Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN)</b> A consultative committee for the CCITT that recommends definitions for voice, data, and video in the megabit-gigabit range. BISDN is also a single ISDN network that can handle voice, data, and video services. BISDN works with an optical cable transport network called Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching service. Switched Multimegabit Data Services (SMDS) is a BISDN service that offers high bandwidth to WANs. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#1003">Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)</a>, <a href="glossa.htm#728">asynchronous transfer mode (ATM).</a></p>

<p><a name="756"></a><b>broadband network</b> A type of LAN on which transmissions travel as analog (radio-frequency) signals over separate inbound and outbound channels. Devices on a broadband network are connected by coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and signals flow across the physical medium in the form of electromagnetic or optical waves. A broadband system uses a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a range of 
frequencies from 50 Mbps to 600 Mbps. These networks can simultaneously accommodate 
television, voice, data, and other services over multiple transmission channels.</p>

<p><a name="757"></a><b>built-in groups</b> One of several group accounts used by Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000. Built-in groups, as the name implies, are included with the network operating system. Built-in groups have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular user. For example, if a domain user account 
belongs to the built-in Administrators group, 
logging on with that account gives a user 
administrative capabilities over the domain and the servers in the domain. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#1032">user account.</a></p>

<p><a name="758"></a><b>byte</b> A unit of information consisting of 8 bits. 
In computer processing or storage, a byte is equivalent to a single character, such as a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. Because a byte represents only a small amount of information, amounts of computer memory are usually given in kilobytes (1024 bytes or 2 raised to the 10th power), megabytes (1,048,576 bytes or 2 raised to the 20th power), gigabytes (1024 megabytes), terabytes (1024 gigabytes), petabytes (1024 terabytes), or exabytes (1024 petabytes).</p>

<p><a name="759a"></a><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision 
avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method</b> An access method by which each computer signals its intent to transmit before it actually transmits data, thus avoiding possible transmission collisions.</p>

<p><a name="759b"></a><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision 
detection (CSMA/CD) access method</b> An access method generally used with bus topologies. Using CSMA/CD, a station &quot;listens&quot; to the physical 
medium to determine whether another station is currently transmitting a data frame. If no other station is transmitting, the station sends its data. A station &quot;listens&quot; to the medium by testing the medium for the presence of a carrier, a specific level of voltage or light&#8212;thus the term carrier-sense. The multiple access indicates that there are multiple stations attempting to access or put data on the cable at the same time. The collision 
detection indicates that the stations are also 
listening for collisions. If two stations attempt to transmit at the same time and a collision occurs, the stations must wait a random period of time before attempting to transmit.</p>

<p><a name="762"></a><b>Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)</b> A communication standard that uses very fast technology, similar to that of cellular telephones, to offer computer data transmissions over existing analog voice networks between voice calls, when the system is not occupied with voice communication.</p>

<p><a name="763"></a><b>certificate</b> A collection of data used for authentication and secure exchange of information on nonsecured networks, such as the Internet. A 
certificate securely binds a public key to the 
entity that holds the corresponding private key. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing CA and can be managed for a user, computer, or 
service. The most widely accepted format for 
certificates is defined by ITU-T X.509 international standards.</p>

<p><a name="764"></a><b>certificate authority (CA)</b> An entity responsible for establishing the authenticity of public keys belonging to users or other CAs.

<p><a name="768"></a><b>console</b> Collections of administrative tools.</p>

<p><a name="769"></a><b>contention</b> Competition among stations on a network for the opportunity to use a communication line or network resource. Two or more computers attempt to transmit over the same cable at the same time, thus causing a collision on the cable. Such a system needs regulation to eliminate data collisions on the cable that can destroy data and bring network traffic to a halt. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossa.htm#759b">carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method.</a></p>

<p><a name="770"></a><b>CRC</b> <i>See</i> <a href="glossa.htm#774">cyclical redundancy check (CRC).</a></p>

<p><a name="771"></a><b>crosstalk</b> Signal overflow from an adjacent wire. When a second faint telephone conversation is heard in the background while one is making a phone call, crosstalk is occurring.</p>

<p><a name="772"></a><b>cryptography</b> The processes, art, and science of keeping messages and data secure. Cryptography is used to enable and ensure confidentiality, data integrity, authentication (entity and data origin), and nonrepudiation.</p>

<p><a name="774"></a><b>cyclical redundancy check (CRC)</b> A form of error checking in transmitting data. The sending packet includes a number produced by a mathematical calculation made at the transmission source. When the packet arrives at its destination, the 
calculation is redone. If the two figures are the same, this indicates that the data in the packet has remained stable. If the calculation at the destination differs from the calculation at the source, this indicates that the data has changed during the transmission. In that case, the CRC routine either drops the packet or signals the source computer to retransmit the data.</p>

In addition, a DBMS permits centralized control of security and data integrity requirements.</p>

<p><a name="776"></a><b>Data Communications Equipment (DCE)</b> One of two types of hardware connected by an RS-232 serial connection, the other being a data terminal equipment (DTE) device. A DCE device takes input from a DTE device and often acts as an 
intermediary device, transforming the input 
signal in some way before sending it to the actual recipient. For example, an external modem is a DCE device that accepts data from a microcomputer (DTE), modulates it, then sends the data along a telephone connection. In communication, an RS-232 DCE device receives data over line 2 and transmits over line 3. In contrast, a DTE

<p><a name="1029"></a><b>uninterruptible power supply (UPS)</b> A device 
connected between a computer or another piece of electronic equipment and a power source, such as an electrical outlet. The UPS ensures that the electrical flow to the computer is not interrupted because of a blackout and, in most cases, protects the computer against potentially damaging events such as power surges and brownouts. Different UPS models offer different levels of protection. All UPS units are equipped with a battery and loss-of-power sensor. If the sensor detects a loss of power, it immediately switches over to the 
battery so that users have time to save their work and shut off the computer. Most higher-end models have features such as power filtering, sophisticated surge protection, and a serial port so that an operating system capable of communicating with a UPS (such as Windows NT) can work with the UPS to facilitate automatic system shutdown.</p>

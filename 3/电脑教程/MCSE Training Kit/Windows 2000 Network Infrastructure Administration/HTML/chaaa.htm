<A NAME="639"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>You are currently configuring TCP/IP manually for new computers and computers moving from one subnet to another. You want to simplify management of TCP/IP addresses and assign them automatically. Which Windows 2000 network service should you use?</li></p>


<p><b>Use DHCP to automate and centrally manage TCP/IP addresses.</b></p>


<p><li>You have an Alpha server with 8 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs. You want to provide file services to over 400 people in your company. Which Windows 2000 operating system would be most appropriate to deploy, and why?</li></p>



<p><b>In this case, deploy Windows 2000 Advanced Server because it provides network load balancing and enterprise memory architecture. Windows 2000 Server only supports 2 GB of RAM, so it would not satisfy the 
necessary requirements.</b></p>


<p><li>You want a Windows 2000 server to connect to and provide routing for AppleTalk-based Macintosh networks. What protocol should you install?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 supports an AppleTalk protocol stack and AppleTalk routing software so that the Windows 2000 server can connect to and provide routing for AppleTalk-based Macintosh networks.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="641"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>What is TCP/IP?</li></p>


<p><b>TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that provide routing in WANs, and 
connectivity to a variety of hosts on the Internet.</b></p>


<p><li>Which TCP/IP utilities are used to verify and test a TCP/IP configuration?</li></p>


<p><b>PING and Ipconfig.</b></p>


<p><li>What is the purpose of a subnet mask?</li></p>


<p><b>To mask a portion of the IP address so IP can distinguish the network ID from the host ID.</b></p>


<p><li>What is the minimum number of areas in an OSPF internetwork?</li></p>


<p><b>An OSPF internetwork always has at least one area called the backbone, whether or not it is subdivided into areas.</b></p>


<p><li>What is an internal router?</li></p>


<p><b>An internal router is a router with all interfaces connected to the same area.</b></p>


<p><li>What is a border router?</li></p>


<p><b>A border router, or ABR, is a router with interfaces connected to 
different areas.</b></p>


<p><li>What Windows 2000 administrative tool can you use to manage internal and border routers?</li></p>

<p><b>Routing and Remote Access.</b></p>

<A NAME="643"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>What is NWLink and how does it relate to Windows 2000?</li></p>


<p><b>NWLink is the Microsoft implementation of IPX/SPX. You must use 
this protocol if you want to use Gateway Service for NetWare or Client Service for NetWare to connect to NetWare servers.</b></p>


<p><li>What is SPX?</li></p>


<p><b>SPX is a transport protocol that offers connection-oriented services over IPX. SPX is used by utilities that require a continuous connection, and provides reliable delivery using sequencing and acknowledgments and verifies successful packet delivery to any network destination by requesting verification from the destination on receipt of the data. SPX also provides a packet burst mechanism that allows the transfer of multiple data packets without requiring that each packet be sequenced and acknowledged 
individually.</b></p>


<p><li>What is Gateway Service for NetWare?</li></p>


<p><b>Gateway Service for NetWare allows you to create a gateway through which Microsoft client computers without Novell NetWare client software can access NetWare file and print resources.</b></p>


<p><li>When choosing between using Client Service for NetWare and Gateway Service for NetWare, what should you consider?</li></p>



<p><b>If you intend to create or indefinitely maintain a heterogeneous environment composed of both servers running Windows 2000 and servers running NetWare, consider using Client Service for NetWare. If you intend to migrate gradually from NetWare to Windows 2000 or if you want to reduce administration, consider using Gateway Service for NetWare.</b></p>


<p><li>What is the NWLink Auto Detect feature?</li></p>


<p><b>The Windows 2000 NWLink Auto Detect feature detects the frame type and network number that are configured on NetWare server(s) on the same network. NWLink Auto Detect is the recommended option for configuring both the network number and the frame type. If the Auto Detect feature selects an inappropriate frame type and network number for a particular adapter, you can manually reset an NWLink frame type or network number for that given adapter.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="644"><H2>Chapter 4</H2></A>

<A NAME="645"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>What is the purpose of analyzing frames with Network Monitor?</li></p>


<p><b>Analyzing frames allows you to identify client-to-server connection problems, find a computer that makes a disproportionate number of requests, and isolate Application Layer problems.</b></p>


<p><li>What kind of data does a frame contain?</li></p>


<p><b>Each frame contains the source address of the computer that sent the message, the destination address of the computer that the frame was sent to, headers from each protocol used within the frame, and the payload being sent.</b></p>


<p><li>What is a capture filter, and what is it used for?</li></p>


<p><b>A capture filter functions like a database query. You can use it to specify the types of network information you want to monitor. For example, to see only a specific subset of computers or protocols, you can create an 
address database, use the database to add addresses to your filter, and then save the filter to a file. By filtering frames, you save both buffer 
resources and analysis time. Later, if necessary, you can load the capture filter file and use the filter again.</b></p>

<A NAME="648"><H3>Lesson 3: Customizing IPSec Policies and Rules</H3></A>

<A NAME="649"><H3>Practice: Building a Custom IPSec Policy</H3></A>

<p>At this point, you still have not configured your custom rule. Only the default response rule properties have been configured.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the default response rule?</p>

<p><b>The default response rule enables negotiation with computers requesting IPSec. A default response rule is added to each new policy you create, but it is not automatically activated. A default response rule can be used for any computer that does not require security, but must be able to appropriately respond when another computer requests secured communications. It can also be used as a template for defining custom rules.</b></p>

<A NAME="650"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>IPSec is defined by what standards group?</li></p>


<p><b>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) IP Security working group.</b></p>


<p><li>Define the difference between secret and public key cryptography.</li></p>

<p><b>Secret key cryptography uses a single preshared key. Public key cryptography uses a key pair, one for encrypting data and verifying digital signatures and the second for decrypting data and creating digital signatures.</b></p>

<p><li>ISAKMP/Oakley provides what functionality?</li></p>


<p><b>ISAKMP/Oakley establishes a secure channel between two computers for communication and establishes an SA.</b></p>


<p><li>What are rules comprised of?</li></p>


<p><b>Rules are comprised of IP filters, negotiation policies, authentication methods, IP tunneling attributes, and adapter types.</b></p>


<p><li>When would a public key certificate be used?</li></p>


<p><b>A public key certificate allows a nontrusted domain computer to use IPSec to communicate with a trusted domain computer.</b></p>


<p><li>What is an IP filter used for?</li></p>


<p><b>IP filters check datagrams for a match against each filter specification. This allows for filtering based on the source and destination address, DNS name, protocol, or protocol ports.</b></p>

<A NAME="658"><H3>Lesson 3: Planning a DNS Implementation</H3></A>

<p><b>Scenario 1: Designing DNS for a Small Network</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>How many DNS domains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>One (or zero, if they have an ISP to manage the name server).</b></p>


<p><li>How many subdomains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Zero.</b></p>


<p><li>How many zones will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>One (or zero, if they have an ISP to manage the name server).</b></p>


<p><li>How many primary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>One (or zero, if they have an ISP to manage the name server).</b></p>


<p><li>How many secondary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>One (or zero, if they have an ISP to manage the name server).</b></p>


<p><li>How many DNS cache-only servers will you need to configure?</li></p>

<p><b>Zero.</b></p>
</ol>

<p><b>Scenario 2: Designing DNS for a Medium-Size Network</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>How many DNS domains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>You will need at least one DNS domain that can contain both hosts 
(computers or services) and subdomains.</b></p>


<p><li>How many subdomains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Three. Your DNS domain includes multiple sites, so you should subdivide the domain to create three subdomains that reflect these groupings.</b></p>


<p><li>How many zones will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Four. You can distribute administrative tasks to different groups in the primary sites by configuring four zones. This will also provide more 
efficient data distribution.</b></p>


<p><li>How many primary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Four. Primary sites will maintain their own equipment and the equipment of the branch offices connected to them. Therefore, you must configure four primary name servers.</b></p>


<p><li>How many secondary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>

<p><b>Branch offices have between 25 and 250 users needing access to all four of the primary sites. When a secondary server is configured for a zone, clients can still resolve names for that zone even if the primary server for the zone goes down; therefore, you should configure four secondary name servers.</b></p>

<p><li>How many DNS cache-only servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>You should configure 10 cache-only servers (one per branch office). This will speed the performance of DNS resolution, reduce DNS-related query traffic, and improve reliability.</b></p>


<p><li>Use the following mileage chart to design a zone/branch office configuration based on the geographical proximity between each primary site and branch office. Branch offices should be in the same zone as the nearest primary site.</li></p>

<p><b>Scenario 3: Designing DNS for a Large Network</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>How many DNS domains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Zero (the domain for this company is in Geneva, Switzerland).</b></p>


<p><li>How many subdomains will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Eleven. Remember that you want to give control of the equipment to each subsidiary, and to have a resource domain in each subsidiary.</b></p>


<p><li>How many zones will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Each of the regional headquarters' subsidiaries will maintain total control of users within their areas. Therefore, you should configure 11 zones.</b></p>


<p><li>How many primary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>

<p><b>One of the requirements defined in this scenario is that line of business applications running on your computers will be configured as servers within the domains. Therefore, you should configure 11 primary 
name servers.</b></p>


<p><li>How many secondary name servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>You can configure servers to host as many different primary or secondary zones as is practical. In this case, line of business applications need to be available to all sites within their areas, as well as the other regional headquarters. Therefore, you should configure 11 secondary name servers for redundancy. When a secondary server is configured for a zone, clients can still resolve names for that zone even if the primary server for the zone goes down.</b></p>


<p><li>How many DNS cache-only servers will you need to configure?</li></p>


<p><b>Three or more. At least one per regional headquarter.</b></p>

<A NAME="659"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>Name the three components of the DNS.</li></p>


<p><b>Resolver, name servers, and domain name space.</b></p>


<p><li>Describe the differences among primary, secondary, and master name servers.</li></p>


<p><b>A primary name server has zone information in locally maintained zone files. A secondary name server downloads zone information. A master name server is the source of the downloads for a secondary name server (which could be a primary or secondary name server).</b></p>


<p><li>List three reasons to have a secondary name server.</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> <b>It operates as a redundant name server (you should have at least one redundant name server for each zone).</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>If you have clients in remote locations, you should have a secondary name server to avoid communicating across slow links.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>A secondary name server reduces the load on the primary name server.</b></li></p>
</ul>


<p><li>Describe the difference between a domain and a zone.</li></p>


<p><b>A domain is a branch of the DNS name space. A zone is a portion of a 
domain that exists as a separate file on the disk storing resource records.</b></p>


<p><li>Describe the difference between recursive and iterative queries.</li></p>


<p><b>In a recursive query, the client instructs the DNS server to respond with either the requested information or an error that the information was not found. In an iterative query, the DNS server responds with the best 
answer it has, typically a referral to another name server that can help resolve the request.</b></p>


<p><li>List the files required for a Windows 2000 DNS implementation.</li></p>


<p><b>Database file, cache file, and reverse lookup file.</b></p>


<p><li>Describe the purpose of the boot file.</li></p>


<p><b>The boot file is used in the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon implementation to start up and configure the DNS server.</b></p>

<A NAME="661"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>How many zones can a single DNS server host?</li></p>


<p><b>A single DNS server can be configured to host zero, one, or multiple zones.</b></p>


<p><li>What benefits do DNS clients obtain from the dynamic update feature of Windows 2000? </li></p>


<p><b>Dynamic update enables DNS client computers to register and dynamically update their resource records with a DNS server whenever changes occur. This reduces the need for manual administration of zone records, especially for clients that frequently move or change locations and use DHCP to obtain an IP address.</b></p>


<p><li>Name one benefit and one disadvantage of a caching-only server.</li></p>


<p><b>The benefit provided by caching-only servers is that they do not generate zone transfer network traffic because they do not contain any zones. A disadvantage of a caching-only server is that when the server is initially started, it has no cached information and must build up this information over time as it services requests.</b></p>


<p><li>List and describe three DNS performance counters.</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> <b>Dynamic update and secure dynamic update counters, for measuring registration and update activity generated by dynamic clients</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Memory usage counters, for measuring system memory usage and memory allocation patterns created by operating the server computer as a Windows 2000 DNS server</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Recursive lookup counters, for measuring queries and responses when the DNS Server service uses recursion to look up and fully resolve DNS names on behalf of requesting clients</b></li></p>

<A NAME="665"><H3>Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li>What is DHCP?</li></p>


<p><b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol simplifies the administrative 
management of IP address configuration by automating address 
configuration for network clients.</b></p>


<p><li>Describe the integration of DHCP with DNS.</li></p>


<p><b>A DHCP server can enable dynamic updates in the DNS name space 
for any DHCP clients that support these updates. Scope clients can then use DNS with dynamic updates to update their computer name-to-IP 
address mapping information whenever changes occur to their DHCP-assigned address.</b></p>

<p><li>What is a DHCP client?</li></p>


<p><b>The term client is used to describe a networked computer that requests and uses the DHCP services offered by a DHCP server.</b></p>


<p><li>What is IP autoconfiguration in Windows 2000?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000-based clients can automatically configure an IP address and subnet mask if a DHCP server is unavailable at system start time.</b></p>


<p><li>Why is it important to plan an implementation of DHCP for a network?</li></p>


<p><b>Either WINS or DNS (or possibly both) is used for registering dynamic name-to-address mappings on your network. To provide name resolution services, you must plan for interoperability of DHCP with these services. Most network administrators implementing DHCP also plan a strategy for implementing DNS and WINS servers.</b></p>


<p><li>What tool do you use to manage DHCP servers in Windows 2000?</li></p>


<p><b>The primary tool that you use to manage DHCP servers is DHCP 
Manager, which is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) component that is added to the Administrative Tools menu when you install the DHCP service.</b></p>


<p><li>What is the symptom of most DHCP-related problems?</li></p>


<p><b>Most DHCP-related problems are identified as a client IP configuration failure. These failures are most often discovered by clients in one of the following ways:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>The client might be configured to use an IP address not provided by the server.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The server sends a negative response back to the client, and the client displays an error message or popup indicating that a DHCP server could not be found.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The server leases the client an address but the client appears to have other network configuration-based problems, such as the inability to register or resolve DNS or NetBIOS names, or to perceive computers beyond its same subnet.</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><li>Demand-dial filters can screen traffic based on what fields of a packet?</li></p>


<p><b>Source and destination IP address, IP protocol identifier, source and 
destination ports, ICMP type, and ICMP code.</b></p>


<p><li>True or false: When setting dial-in user permissions (Allow Access, Deny Access) through the User Property page, RAPs are not used.</li></p>



<p><b>False. In the user interface it appears that RAP is not used. In actuality, the dial-in user settings work in conjunction with RAP.</b></p>


<p><li>True or False: DHCP packets are never sent over Routing and Remote Access links.</li></p>



<p><b>False. Routing and Remote Access clients do not use DHCP to get an 
address, but may use DHCPINFORM packets to get other configuration options. The DHCP relay agent must be installed and using the &quot;internal&quot; interface for this to work.</b></p>


<p><li>What is the function of BAP?</li></p>


<p><b>To bring up or drop modem or ISDN links as needed for bandwidth 
on demand.</b></p>

<p><li>What is the purpose of NAT?</li></p>


<p><b>NAT allows computers on a small network, such as a home office, to share a single Internet connection.</b></p>


<p><li>What are the components of NAT?</li></p>


<p><b>The translation component is the router on which NAT is enabled. The addressing component provides IP address configuration information to the other computers on the home network. The name resolution component becomes the DNS server for the other computers on the home network. When name resolution requests are received by the NAT computer, it forwards the name resolution requests to the Internet-based DNS server for which it is configured and returns the responses to the home network computer.</b></p>


<p><li>If a small business is using the 10.0.0.0 private network for its intranet and has been granted the public IP address of 198.200.200.1 by its ISP, to what public IP address does NAT map all private IP addresses being used on network 10.0.0.0?</li></p>

<p><b>The NAT maps (using static or dynamic mappings) all private IP 
addresses being used on network 10.0.0.0 to the public IP address of 198.200.200.1.</b></p>


<p><li>What must you do to allow Internet users to access resources on your private network?</li></p>



<p><b>You must configure a static IP address configuration on the resource server including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server. You should exclude the IP address being used by the resource computer from the range of IP addresses being allocated by the NAT computer. Next, you configure a special port, which is a static mapping of a public address and port number to a private address and port number.</b></p>

<p><li>What are certificates, and what is their purpose?</li></p>


<p><b>A certificate (digital certificate, public key certificate) is a digital document that attests to the binding of a public key to an entity. The main purpose of a certificate is to generate confidence that the public key contained in the certificate actually belongs to the entity named in the certificate.</b></p>


<p><li>What is a certificate authority (CA), and what does it do?</li></p>

<p><b>Certificates are issued by a CA, which can be any trusted service or entity willing to vouch for the identities of those to whom it issues certificates, and their association with specific keys.</b></p>


<p><li>What are the four types of Microsoft certificate authorities?</li></p>


<p><b>Enterprise root CA, enterprise subordinate CA, stand-alone root CA, and stand-alone subordinate CA.</b></p>


<p><li>Name one reason for a certificate revocation.</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> <b>Compromise, or suspected compromise, of an entity's private key</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Fraud in obtaining the certificate</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Change in status</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>What are some potential security risks you should identify in your security plan?</li></p>



<p><b>It could be possible for competitors to gain access to proprietary product information, or unauthorized users could attempt to maliciously modify Web pages or overload computers so that they are unusable.</b></p>


<p><li>What is authentication and how can you implement it?</li></p>


<p><b>Authentication is the process of identifying users who attempt to connect to a network. When users are authenticated on your network, they can utilize network resources based on their access permissions. To provide authentication to network users, you establish user accounts.</b></p>


<p><li>What are some security features of Windows 2000?</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> <b>Security templates</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Kerberos authentication</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Public key infrastructure (PKI)</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>IPSec management</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>NT file system encryption</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><li>How can you secure a connection between your network and the Internet?</li></p>


<p><b>To secure your organization's network for access to and from the Internet, you can put a firewall between the two networks. The firewall provides connectivity for network users to the Internet while minimizing the risks that connectivity introduces. It also prevents access to computers on your network from the Internet, except for those computers authorized to have such access.</b></p>


<p><li>What are some remote access protocols you can implement for security?</li></p>


<p><b>Routing and Remote Access can use a secure user authentication 
method including:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</b></li></p>

<p><li><b> Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)</b></li></p>

<p><li><b> Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP)</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</b></li></p>
</ul>


<p><li>Name two forms of encryption available for demand-dial connections.</li></p>


<p><b>Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) and Internet Protocol 
Security (IPSec).</b></p>


<p><li>How do System Monitor and Network Monitor provide the ability to monitor security on your network?</li></p>

<p><b>System Monitor is used to monitor anything from hardware to software, and can also monitor security events such as Errors Access Permissions, Errors Granted Access, Errors Logon, and IIS Security. Network Monitor focuses exclusively on network activity to allow you to understand the traffic and behavior of your network components. If you install the full version available from Systems Management Server, you can capture and view every packet on the network.</b></p>

<p><li>How is Event Viewer used to monitor security?</li></p>


<p><b>Although you can use Event Viewer to gather information about hardware and software problems, it can also be used to monitor Windows 2000 
security events such as valid and invalid logon attempts. The security log can also contain events related to resource use, such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects.</b></p>


<p><li>How do you enable remote access logging in Windows 2000?</li></p>


<p><b>You can enable event logging in the Event Logging tab on the properties of a remote access server in Routing and Remote Access.</b></p>

<A NAME="499"><h1>Lesson 5: Configuring Dfs to Gain Access to Network Resources</h1></A>
<p>The Microsoft distributed file system (Dfs) for Windows 2000 Server provides users with 
convenient access to shared folders that are distributed throughout a network. A single Dfs 
shared folder serves as an access point to other shared folders in the network. This lesson 
introduces you to Dfs.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure Dfs for Windows 2000 Server to provide user access to shared folders</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="500"><h2>Understanding Dfs</h2></A>
<p>The Microsoft Dfs for Windows 2000 Server allows system administrators to make it easy for 
users to access and manage files that are physically distributed across a network. With Dfs, 
you can make files distributed across multiple servers appear to users as if they reside in 
one place on the network.</p>

<p>Dfs organizes shared folders that can reside on different computers, as shown in Figure 
10.12. Dfs provides users with easy navigation to these shared folders. Users do not need to 
know where a resource is on a network to gain access to it. Dfs facilitates administering 
multiple shared folders.</p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 10.12</b> <i>Overview of Dfs</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p>To share file resources across the network, Dfs does the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Organizes resources in a hierarchy.</b> Dfs uses a hierarchy of server shares called 
a <i>Dfs share</i>. To create a Dfs share, you must first create a Dfs root. A <i>Dfs root</i> 
is a container for files and Dfs links. Each Dfs root can have multiple links beneath it, each 
of which points to a shared folder. The links of the Dfs root represent shared folders that can 
be physically located on different file servers. Table 10.9 describes the two types of Dfs 
roots.</li></p>

<p><b>Table 10.9</b> <i>Types of Dfs Roots</i></p>
<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Type of Dfs Root</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain</td>
<td valign="top">Stores the Dfs topology in Active Directory. Allows links to point to 
multiple identical shared folders for fault tolerance. Supports Domain Name System (DNS), 
multiple-level Dfs links, and file replication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Standalone</td>
<td valign="top">Stores the Dfs topology on a single computer, not in Active Directory. 
Provides no fault tolerance if the computer that stores the Dfs topology or any of the 
shared folders that Dfs uses fails. Supports only one level of Dfs links.</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p><li><b>Facilitates network navigation.</b> A user who navigates a Dfs-managed shared 
folder does not need to know the name of the server on which the folder is shared. This 
simplifies network access because users no longer need to locate the network server on 
which a specific resource is located. After connecting to a Dfs root, users can browse and 
gain access to all resources below the root, regardless of the location of the server on 
which the resource is located.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Facilitates network administration.</b> Dfs also simplifies network administration. 
If a server fails, you can move a link from one server to another without users being aware 
of the change. All that is required to move a link is to modify the Dfs folder to refer to the 
new server location of the shared folders. Users continue to use the same Dfs path for the 
link.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Preserves network permissions.</b> A user can gain access to a shared folder through 
Dfs as long as the user has the required permission to gain access to the shared folder. If 
further restrictions are necessary, NTFS permissions can be set.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Only client computers with Dfs client software can gain access to Dfs resources. Computers 
running Windows NT 4.0 and later or Windows 98 include a Dfs client. You must download and 
install a Dfs client for Windows 95.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="501"><h2>Reasons for Using Dfs</h2></A>
<p>You should consider implementing Dfs if</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Users who access shared folders are distributed across a site or sites</li></p>

<p><li>Most users require access to multiple shared folders</li></p>

<p><li>Server load balancing could be improved by redistributing shared folders</li></p>

<p><li>Users require uninterrupted access to shared folders</li></p>

<p><li>Your organization has Web sites for either internal or external use</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="502"><h2>Dfs Topology</h2></A>
<p>A Dfs topology consists of a Dfs root, one or more Dfs links, and one or more Dfs shared 
folders (also known as replicas), to which each Dfs link points.</p>

<p>For domain-based Dfs, the domain server on which a Dfs root resides is known as a host 
server. You can replicate a Dfs root by creating roots on other servers in the domain. This 
provides file availability if the host server becomes unavailable.</p>

<p>To users, a Dfs topology provides a unified and transparent access to the network resources 
they need. To system administrators, a Dfs topology is a single DNS namespace. With domain-based 
Dfs, the DNS names for the Dfs roots resolve to the host servers for the Dfs root.</p>

<p>Because the host server for a domain-based Dfs is a member server within a domain, the Dfs 
topology is automatically published to Active Directory by default, thus providing 
synchronization of Dfs topologies across host servers. This in turn provides fault tolerance for 
the Dfs root and supports optional replication of Dfs shared folders.</p>

<A NAME="503"><h2>Creating a Dfs</h2></A>
<p>The tasks for creating a Dfs are:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Create a Dfs root.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a Dfs link.</li></p>

<p><li>Add Dfs shared folders (optional).</li></p>

<p><li>Set replication policy.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="504"><h2>Creating a Dfs Root</h2></A>
<p>You can create a Dfs root on Windows 2000 FAT or NTFS partitions. However, the FAT file 
system does not offer the security advantages of NTFS. When setting up a Dfs root, you have 
the option of establishing either a domain or a standalone Dfs root.</p>

<p><li><b>To create a Dfs root</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Distributed 
File System.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Action menu, click New Dfs Root to start the New Dfs Root Wizard. Table 10.10 
describes the wizard options that you can configure.</li></p>

</table></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="505"><h2>Creating a Dfs Link</h2></A>
<p>In a network environment, it might be difficult for users to keep track of the physical 
locations of shared resources. When you use Dfs, the network and file system structures become 
transparent to users. This enables you to centralize and optimize access to resources based on 
a single tree structure. Users can browse the links under a Dfs root without knowing where the 
referenced resources are physically located.</p>

<p>After you create a Dfs root, you can create Dfs links. Currently, the maximum number of Dfs 
links that you can assign to a Dfs root is 1000.</p>

<p><li><b>To create a Dfs link</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Distributed 
File System.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Dfs root to which you will attach a Dfs link. In the Action menu, click New 
Dfs Link.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Create A New Dfs Link dialog box (see Figure 10.13), in the Link Name box, type 
a name that users will see when they connect to Dfs.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 10.13</b> <i>Create A New Dfs Link dialog box</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p><li>In the Send The User To This Shared Folder box type or browse for the UNC name for the 
actual location of the shared folder to which the link refers.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Comment box, type optional additional information to help keep track of the shared 
folder (for example, the actual name of the shared folder).</li></p>

<p><li>In the Clients Cache This Referral For <i>X</i> Seconds box, enter the length of time for 
which clients cache a referral to a Dfs link. After the referral time expires, a client queries 
the Dfs server about the location of the link, even if the client has previously established a 
connection with the link.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>The link appears below the Dfs root volume in the Distributed File System console.</p>

<A NAME="506"><h2>Adding a Dfs Shared Folder</h2></A>
<p>For each Dfs link, you can create a set of Dfs shared folders to which the Dfs link points. 
Within a set of Dfs shared folders, you add the first folder to the set when you create the Dfs 
link, using the Distributed File System console. Subsequent folders are added using the console's 
Add A New Replica dialog box. The maximum number of Dfs shared folders allowed in a set of shared 
folders is 32.</p>

<p>When you add Dfs shared folders, you can choose which folders will participate in replication. 
If you set folders to participate in replication, you must then set the replication policy for the 
shared folders, described later in this lesson.</p>

<p><li><b>To add a Dfs shared folder</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Distributed File 
System.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Dfs console tree, right-click the Dfs link to which you want to assign a shared 
folder, then click New Replica.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Add A New Replica dialog box (see Figure 10.14), enter or browse for the name of the 
new shared folder in the Send The User To This Shared Folder box.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 10.14</b> <i>Add A New Replica dialog box</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p><li>In the Replication Policy box</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Click Manual Replication to prevent the files located in the folder from participating in 
replication.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Automatic Replication to cause the files located in the folder to participate in replication. Automatic replication is not available for standalone 
distributed file systems and can only be used for files stored on NTFS volumes on Windows 2000 
servers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="507"><h2>Setting Replication Policy</h2></A>
<p>You can ensure that the content of folders is always available to users by replicating that 
content to other roots or Dfs shared folders in the domain. You can replicate both Dfs roots and 
Dfs shared folders. Replication copies the content of one Dfs root to another, or from one Dfs 
shared folder to another Dfs shared folder.</p>

<A NAME="508"><h3>Replicating a Dfs Root</h3></A>
<p>Replicating a Dfs root to another server in the domain ensures that if the host server becomes 
unavailable for any reason, the Dfs associated with that Dfs root is still available to domain 
users.</p>

<p><li><b>To replicate a Dfs root</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Distributed File 
System.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Dfs console tree, right-click the existing Dfs root that you want to replicate and 
select New Root Replica.</li></p>

<p><li>The New Dfs Root Wizard guides you through the process of replicating the Dfs root.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="509"><h3>Setting Replication Policy for Dfs Shared Folders</h3></A>
<p>When replicating a Dfs shared folder, Dfs stores a duplicate copy of the contents of the 
original shared folder in another shared folder.</p>

<p>Replicating a Dfs shared folder is a two-step process. First, you add the Dfs shared folder to a 
Dfs link, specifying that the folder will participate in replication. Then, you set the replication 
policy for the set of Dfs shared folders associated with that link. Replication of Dfs shared 
folders can be done either manually or automatically, as described in the following sections. Do 
not mix automatic and manual replication within a set of Dfs shared folders. Using one method of 
replication exclusively ensures that the contents of the Dfs shared folders remain 
synchronized.</p>

<A NAME="510"><h5>Automatic Replication</h5></A>
<p>For domain Dfs roots only, you can enable Dfs to automatically replicate the contents of a Dfs 
shared folder to other folders in the set of Dfs shared folders. This keeps the content of the Dfs 
shared folders synchronized as changes to one or more of the Dfs shared folders occurs. Automatic 
replication is not available for standalone Dfs and can only be used for files stored on NTFS 
volumes on Windows 2000 servers. Other types of files, such as FAT files, must be replicated 
manually.</p>

<p>Although invisible to users and administrators, Dfs uses the File Replication Service (FRS) 
to perform this function. Within a set of Dfs folders, FRS manages updates across any folders that 
are targeted for replication. By default, FRS synchronizes the contents of the Dfs shared folders 
at 15-minute intervals.</p>

<p>When you set replication policy, you select one of your Dfs shared folders as the initial 
master, which then replicates its contents to the other Dfs shared folders in the set of Dfs shared 
folders.</p>

<A NAME="511"><h5>Manual Replication</h5></A>
<p>For domain Dfs, if you do not enable FRS management of Dfs shared folders, you must maintain the 
same content in all of the Dfs shared folders manually.</p>

<p><li><b>To set replication policy for shared folders</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Distributed File 
System.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Dfs console tree, right-click the Dfs link containing the shared folders for which 
you want to set a replication policy and select Replication Policy.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Replication Policy dialog box (see Figure 10.15), click a Dfs shared folder that you 
want to use as the master folder for replication, then click Set Master.</li></p>

<A NAME="513"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that the Microsoft distributed file system (Dfs) for Windows 2000 
Server provides users with convenient access to shared folders that are distributed throughout a 
network. A Dfs share uses a tree structure containing a root and links. The links of the Dfs root 
represent shared folders that can be physically located on different file servers.</p>

<p>It might be difficult for users to keep track of the physical locations of shared 
resources in a network environment. When you use Dfs, the network and file system structures become 
transparent to users. A user who navigates a Dfs-managed shared folder does not need to know the 
name of the server on which the folder is shared, or the actual file name.</p>

<p>After connecting to a Dfs root, users can browse and gain access to all resources below the 
root, regardless of the location of the server on which the resource is located. If a server fails, 
you can move a link from one server to another without users being aware of the change. All that is 
required to move a link is a modification of the Dfs folder to refer to the new server location of 
the shared folders. Users continue to use the same Dfs path for the link.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson you shared some existing folders, created some new 
share folders, created a Dfs root, and then created some Dfs links.</p>

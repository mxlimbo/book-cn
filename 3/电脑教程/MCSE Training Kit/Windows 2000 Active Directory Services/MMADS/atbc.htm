<A NAME="12"><h1>Getting Started</h1></A>
<p>This self-paced training course contains hands-on procedures to help you learn about Windows 2000 Active Directory. To complete these procedures, you must have the following:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> One computer running Windows 2000 Server</li></p>

</ul>

<p>There are a few optional practices and exercises in this book that require two computers. Using a second computer is optional; it is not required to meet the lesson objectives. If you have only one computer, read through the steps and 
familiarize yourself with the procedure as best you can.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you set up the server on its own network specifically for this self-paced training because, to complete the lessons in this book, you will need to set up a domain controller and make changes to the domain controller that can affect other network users. However, you can use a domain controller on an existing network.</p>

<p>
<div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr>
Several exercises may require you to make changes to your servers. This may have undesirable results if you are connected to a larger network. Check with your network administrator before attempting these exercises.

<p><b>Installing Windows 2000 Server</b></p>

<p>To complete the exercises in this course, you should install Windows 2000 Server on a computer with no formatted partitions. During installation, you can use the Windows 2000 Server Setup program to create a partition on your hard disk, on which you install Windows 2000 Server as a stand-alone server in a workgroup.</p>

<p><b><li>To create Windows 2000 Server Setup Diskettes</li></b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Complete this procedure on a computer running MS-DOS or any version of Windows with access to the Bootdisk directory on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM. If your computer is configured with a bootable CD-ROM drive, you can install Windows 2000 without using the Setup disks. To complete this exercise as outlined, bootable CD-ROM support must be disabled in the BIOS.</li></p>

</ul>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
This procedure requires four formatted 1.44-MB disks. If you use diskettes that contain data, the data will be overwritten without warning.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>

<p><li> Label the four blank, formatted 1.44-MB diskettes as follows:</li></p>

<ul>

<p><li> Windows 2000 Server Setup Disk #1</li></p>

<p><li> Windows 2000 Server Setup Disk #2</li></p>

<p><li> Windows 2000 Server Setup Disk #3</li></p>

<p><li> Windows 2000 Server Setup Disk #4</li></p>

<p>Setup displays the Windows 2000 Server Setup screen, prompting you to 
select an area of free space or an existing partition on which to install 
Windows 2000. This stage of setup provides a way for you to create and 
delete partitions on your hard disk.</p>

<p>If your computer does not contain any disk partitions (as required for this 
exercise), you will notice that the hard disk listed on the screen contains an existing unformatted partition.</p>

<p><li> Make sure that the Unpartitioned space partition is highlighted and then type <b>c.</b></li></p>

<p>Setup displays the Windows 2000 Setup screen, confirming that you've chosen to create a new partition in the unpartitioned space and informing you of the minimum and maximum sizes of the partition you might create.</p>

<p><li> Specify the size of the partition you want to create (at least 2 GB) and press Enter to continue.</li></p>

<p>Setup displays the Windows 2000 Setup screen, showing the new partition as C: New (Unformatted).</p>

</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Although you can create additional partitions from the remaining unpartitioned space during setup, it is recommended that you perform additional partitioning tasks after you install Windows 2000. To partition hard disks after installation, use the Disk Management console.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="328"><h1>Lesson 4: Creating User Profiles</h1></A>
<p>A <i>user profile</i> is a collection of folders and data that stores the user's current desktop environment, application settings, and personal data. A user profile also contains all of the network connections that are established when a user logs on to a computer, such as Start menu items and mapped drives to network servers. User profiles maintain consistency for users in their desktop environments by providing each user with the same desktop environment that he or she had the last time that he or she logged on to the computer. This lesson introduces user profiles and explains the differences between local user profiles, roaming user profiles, and mandatory user profiles.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li> Explain the difference between a local user profile, a roaming user profile, and a mandatory user profile</li></p>

<p><li> Configure a local user profile</li></p>

<p><li> Create a roaming user profile</li></p>

</p>

<A NAME="329"><h2>User Profiles</h2></A>
<p>On computers running Windows 2000, user profiles automatically create and maintain the desktop settings for each user's work environment on the local 
computer. A user profile is created for each user when he or she logs on to a computer for the first time.</p>

<p>User profiles provide several advantages to users:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> More than one user can use the same computer, and each receives desktop settings when he or she logs on.</li></p>


<p><li> When users log on to their workstation, they receive the desktop settings as they existed when they logged off.</li></p>

<p><li> Customization of the desktop environment by one user does not affect another user's settings.</li></p>



<p><li> User profiles can be stored on a server so that they can follow users to any computer running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 on the network. These are called <i>roaming user profiles</i>.</li></p>

<p><li> Application settings are retained for applications that are Windows 2000-certified.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>As an administrative tool, user profiles provide these options:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> You can create a default user profile that is appropriate for the user's tasks.</li></p>

<p><li> You can set up a <i>mandatory user profile</i>, a profile that does not save changes made by the user to the desktop settings. Users can modify the desktop settings of the computer while they are logged on, but none of these changes is saved when they log off. The mandatory profile settings are downloaded to the local computer each time the user logs on.</li></p>

<p><li> You can specify the default user settings that will be included in all of the individual user profiles.</li></p>

</ul>

<A NAME="330"><h3>Profile Types</h3></A>
<p>There are three types of user profiles:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Local user profile.</b> A local user profile is created the first time you log on to a computer and is stored on a computer's local hard disk. Any changes made to your local user profile are specific to the computer on which you make the changes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Roaming user profile.</b> A roaming user profile is created by your system administrator and is stored on a server. This profile is available every time you log on to any computer on the network. Changes made to your roaming user profile are updated on the server.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Mandatory user profile.</b> A mandatory user profile is a roaming profile that can be used to specify particular settings for individuals or an entire group of users. Only system administrators can make changes to mandatory user profiles.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="331"><h3>Settings Saved in a User Profile</h3></A>
<p>A user profile contains configuration preferences and options for each user&#8212;a snapshot of a user's desktop environment.</p>

<p>Table 7.14 shows the settings contained in a user profile.</p>

<p>Using the My Documents folder centralizes all user settings and personal documents into a single folder that is part of the user profile. Windows 2000 automatically sets up the My Documents folder and it is the default location for storing users' data for Microsoft applications. Home directories can also contain files and 
programs for a user. Home directories are covered in the next lesson.</p>

<A NAME="333"><h2>Local User Profiles</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 creates a local user profile the first time that a user logs on at a computer, storing the profile on that computer. The local user profile is stored in the C:\Documents and Settings\<i>user_logon_name</i> folder, where C:\ is the name of your system drive and <i>user_logon_name</i> is the name the user enters when 
logging on to the system. When a user logs on to the client computer running Windows 2000, the user always receives his or her individual desktop settings and connections, regardless of how many users share the same client computer.</p>

<p>A user changes his or her local user profile by changing desktop settings. For 
example, a user may make a new network connection or add a file to My Documents. Then, when a user logs off, Windows 2000 incorporates the changes into the user profile stored on the computer. The next time that the user logs on, the new network connection and the file are present.</p>

<A NAME="334"><h2>Roaming User Profiles</h2></A>
<p>To support users who work at multiple computers, you can set up roaming user profiles. A roaming user profile is a user profile that you set up on a network server so that the profile is available to the user no matter where the user logs on in the domain. The user always receives his or her individual desktop settings and connections, in contrast to a local user profile, which only resides on one client computer.</p>

<p>When a user logs on, Windows 2000 copies the roaming user profile from the network server to the client computer and applies the roaming user profile settings to that computer. The first time that a user logs on at a computer, Windows 2000 copies all documents to the local computer. Thereafter, when the user logs on to the computer, Windows 2000 compares the locally stored user profile files and the roaming user profile files. It copies only the files that have changed since the last time that the user logged on at the computer, which makes the logon 
process shorter.</p>

<p>When a user logs off, Windows 2000 copies changes that were made to the local copy of the roaming user profile back to the server where the profile is stored.</p>

<A NAME="335"><h3>Standard Roaming User Profiles</h3></A>
<p>You can create a standard roaming user profile for a group of users by configuring the desired desktop environment and then copying the standard profile to the user's roaming user profile location.</p>

<p>You use standard roaming user profiles for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> To provide a standard desktop environment for multiple users with similar job responsibilities. These users require the same network resources.</li></p>

<p><li> To provide users with the work environment that they need to perform their jobs and to remove connections and applications that they do not require.</li></p>

<p><li> To simplify troubleshooting. Technical support would know the exact baseline setup of the desktops and could easily find a deviation or a problem.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="336"><h3>Creating Roaming User Profiles</h3></A>
<p>You should create roaming user profiles on a file server that you frequently back up, so that you have copies of the latest roaming user profiles. To improve logon performance for a busy network, place the roaming user profile folder on a member server instead of a domain controller. The copying of roaming user profiles between the server and client computers can use a lot of system resources, such as bandwidth and computer processing. If the profiles are on the domain controller, this can delay the authentication of users by the domain controller.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
To successfully create roaming user profiles and assign home directories for user accounts, you must have permission to administer the object in which the user accounts reside.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><li><b> To set up a roaming user profile</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> On a server, create a shared folder and use a path with the following format: <i>\\server_name\shared_folder_name</i></li></p>

<p><li> On the Profile tab in the Properties dialog box (see Figure 7.10) for the user account, provide the path to the shared folder in the Profile Path box (such as <i>\\server_name\shared_folder_name\logon_name</i>).</li></p>
</ol>

<p>You can type the variable <b>%username%</b> instead of the user's logon name. When you use this variable, Windows 2000 automatically replaces the variable with the user account name for the roaming user profile, which is useful when copying template accounts.</p>

<A NAME="337"><h3>Creating a Standard Roaming User Profile</h3></A>
<p>The following checklist provides an overview of the tasks required to implement a standard roaming user profile for a group of users.</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Create a user profile template with the appropriate configuration. Do this by creating a user account using the Active Directory Users and Computers console and then configuring the appropriate desktop settings.</li></p>

<p><li> Create a shared folder on the server, which will be used to allow users to access the profile template from a remote computer.</li></p>


<p><li> Copy the user profile template to the shared folder on the server and specify the users who are permitted to use the profile in the User Profile tab in the System Properties dialog box in the Control Panel (see Figure 7.11).</li></p>

<p><li> Specify the path to the profile template in the Profile tab in the User Properties dialog box (see Figure 7.10).</li></p>

<A NAME="338"><h2>Mandatory User Profiles</h2></A>
<p>A mandatory user profile is a read-only roaming user profile. Users can modify the desktop settings of the computer while they are logged on, but none of these changes is saved when they log off. The next time that the user logs on, the profile is the same as the last time that he or she logged on. The mandatory profile settings are downloaded to the local computer each time the user logs on.</p>

<p>You can assign one mandatory profile to multiple users who require the same desktop settings, such as bank tellers. By changing only one profile, you can change the desktop environment for several users.</p>

<A NAME="339"><h3>Creating a Mandatory User Profile</h3></A>
<p>A hidden file in the profile (for example, \\SERVER1\<i>share</i>\<i>user_logon_name</i>) called NTUSER.DAT contains that section of the Windows 2000 system settings that applies to the individual user account and contains the user environment 
settings, such as desktop appearance. This is the file that you make read-only by changing its name to NTUSER.MAN.</p>

<A NAME="342"><h3>Exercise 2: Defining a Standard Roaming User Profile</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise you create a shared folder in which a standard roaming user 
profile can reside. You create a user account named Profile Template, which will be the model for a standard roaming user profile. You configure the settings for the template profile. Then, you copy the Profile Template user profile to the shared folder for User2. Finally, you specify the path to the profile for User2. Optionally, you can test the standard roaming profile if you have access to two computers on the same network.</p>

<A NAME="343"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that a user profile is a collection of folders and data that stores the user's current desktop environment and application settings, as well as personal data. A user profile also contains all of the network connections that are established when a user logs on to a computer, such as Start menu items and mapped drives to network servers.</p>

<p>You learned that there are three types of user profiles: local user profiles, roaming user profiles, and mandatory user profiles. A local user profile is created the first time you log on to a computer and is stored on a computer's local hard disk. Any changes made to your local user profile are specific to the computer on which you make the changes. A roaming user profile is created by your system administrator and is stored on a server. This profile is available every time you log on to any computer on the network. Changes made to your roaming user profile are updated on the server. A mandatory user profile is a roaming profile that can be used to specify particular settings for individuals or an entire group of users. Only system administrators can make changes to mandatory 
user profiles.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you created a local user account and profile and then viewed, defined, and tested the profile. You also created a standard roaming user profile, which included creating a user account model for use as a profile template, copying the profile template to a shared folder in the server, and specifying the path to the profile for the user.</p>

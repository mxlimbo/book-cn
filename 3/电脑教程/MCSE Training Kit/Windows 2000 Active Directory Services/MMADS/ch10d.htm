<A NAME="479"><h1>Lesson 3: Sharing Folders</h1></A>
<p>You can share resources with others by sharing folders containing those resources. To share a 
folder, you must be a member of one of several groups, depending on the role of the computer where 
the shared folder resides. When you share a folder, you can control access to the folder by 
limiting the number of users who can simultaneously gain access to it, and you can also control 
access to the folder and its contents by assigning permissions to selected users and groups. After 
a shared folder is created, you may need to modify folder sharing properties. You can stop sharing 
a folder, change its share name, and change user and group permissions to gain access to it. To 
access a shared folder, users must first have appropriate permissions and then make a connection to 
it. This lesson explains how to create and modify shared folders and how to connect to a shared 
folder.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Create and modify shared folders</li></p>

<p><li>Make a connection to a shared folder</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="480"><h2>Requirements for Sharing Folders</h2></A>
<p>In Windows 2000, members of the built-in Administrators, Server Operators, and Power Users 
groups are able to share folders. The groups that can share folders and the machines on which they 
can share folders depend on the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>In a Windows 2000 domain, the Administrators and Server Operators groups can share folders 
residing on any machines in the domain. The Power Users group is a local group and can only share 
folders residing on the stand-alone server or computer running Windows 2000 Professional where the 
group is located.</li></p>

<p><li>In a Windows 2000 workgroup, the Administrators and Power Users groups can share folders on 
the stand-alone server or the computer running Windows 2000 Professional on which the group 
exists.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If the folder to be shared resides on an NTFS volume, users must also have at least the Read 
permission for that folder to be able to share it.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="481"><h2>Administrative Shared Folders</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 automatically shares certain folders for administrative purposes. These shares are 
appended with a dollar sign ($). The $ hides the shared folder from users who browse the computer. 
The root of each volume, the system root folder, and the location of the printer drivers are all 
hidden shared folders that you can access from across the network.</p>

<p>Table 10.3 describes the purpose of the administrative shared folders that Windows 2000 
automatically provides.</p>

<p><b>Table 10.3</b> <i>Windows 2000 Administrative Shared Folders</i></p>
<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Share</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">C$, D$, E$, and so on</td>
<td valign="top">The root of each volume on a hard disk is automatically shared, and the share name 
is the drive letter appended with a dollar sign ($). When you connect to this folder, you have 
access to the entire volume. You use the administrative shares to remotely connect to the computer 
to perform administrative tasks. Windows 2000 assigns the Full Control permission to the 
Administrators group.

<p>Windows 2000 also automatically shares CD-ROM drives and creates the share name by appending the 
$ to the CD-ROM drive letter.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Admin$</td>
<td valign="top">The systemroot folder, which is C:\Winnt by default, is shared as Admin$. 
Administrators can gain access to this shared folder to administer Windows 2000 without knowing the 
folder in which it is installed. Only members of the Administrators group have access to this 
share. Windows 2000 assigns the Full Control permission to the Administrators group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Print$</td>
<td valign="top">When you install the first shared printer, the <i>systemroot</i>\ 
System32\Spool\Drivers folder is shared as Print$. This folder provides access to printer driver 
files for clients. Only members of the Administrators, Server Operators, and Print Operators groups 
have the Full Control permission. The Everyone group has the Read permission.</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>Hidden shared folders are not limited to those that the system automatically creates. You can 
share additional folders and append a $ to the end of the share name. Then, only users who know the 
folder name and posess proper permissions can gain access to the folder.</p>

<A NAME="482"><h2>Sharing a Folder</h2></A>
<p>When you share a folder, you can give it a share name, provide comments to describe the folder 
and its content, limit the number of users who have access to the folder, assign permissions, and 
share the same folder multiple times.</p>

<p><li><b>To share a folder</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Right-click the folder that you want to share, then click Sharing.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Sharing tab of the Properties dialog box (see Figure 10.5), click Share This 
Folder.</li></p>

<p>

</p><p>
<caption><b>Figure 10.5</b> <i>The Sharing tab of the properties dialog box for a 
folder</i></caption>
</p>

<p><li>Type the name that users from remote locations use to make a connection to the shared folder 
in the Share Name box.</li></p>

<p><li>Optionally, type a description for the share name in the Comment box. The comment appears in 
addition to the share name when users at client computers browse the server for shared folders, and 
can be used to identify contents of the shared folder.</li></p>

<p><li>In the User Limit area, enter the number of users who can concurrently connect to the shared 
folder. If you click Maximum Allowed as the user limit, Windows 2000 Professional supports up to 10 
connections total for all shares, services, etc. Windows 2000 Server can support an unlimited 
number of connections, but the number of client access licenses that you purchased limits the 
connections.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="483"><h2>Assigning Shared Folder Permissions</h2></A>
<p>After you share a folder, the next step is to specify which users have access to the shared 
folder by assigning shared folder permissions to selected user accounts and groups.</p>

<p><li><b>To assign permissions to user accounts and groups for a shared folder</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the Sharing tab of the Properties dialog box for the shared folder, click 
Permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Permissions For dialog box for the shared folder (see Figure 10.6), ensure that the 
Everyone group is selected and then click Remove.</li></p>

object. Repeat this step for all user accounts and groups to which you want to assign 
permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Permissions dialog box for the shared folder, click the user account or group, and 
then, under Permissions, select the Allow or the Deny check box of the appropriate permissions for 
the user account or group.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
In the Select Users, Computers, Or Groups dialog box, use the Look In list to see other domains or 
the local computer from which you can select user account and group names for assigning 
permissions. You can also search Active Directory for user accounts and groups by selecting Entire 
Directory from the Look In list.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="484"><h2>Modifying Shared Folders</h2></A>
<p>You can modify shared folders. You can stop sharing a folder, add or remove the share name, 
and modify shared folder permissions.</p>

<p><li><b>To modify a shared folder</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click the Sharing tab in the Properties dialog box of the shared folder.</li></p>

<p><li>To complete the appropriate task, use the steps in Table 10.5.</li></p>

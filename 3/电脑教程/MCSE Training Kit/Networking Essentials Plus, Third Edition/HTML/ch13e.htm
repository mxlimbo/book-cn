<A NAME="722"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="723"><h3>Understanding the Problem</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>It is essential to take a structured approach to troubleshooting in order to resolve network problems.</li></p>

<p><li> Collecting information lays the foundation for isolating a problem.</li></p>

<p><li>Asking the users the right questions will provide the most information. Use open-ended questions.</li></p>

<p><li>The troubleshooting process includes five steps: defining the problem, isolating the cause, making the repair, confirming the solution, and documenting the outcome.</li></p>

<p><li> If a problem is not obvious, it will be necessary to divide the network into logical
groups such as clients, adapters, hubs, cabling and connectors, servers, connectivity
components, and protocols.</li></p>

<p><li> Repairing network problems sometimes requires working on several problems at once.
Because it is not possible to repair everything at the same time, you will need to establish
priorities.</li></p>

<p><li>The network administrator should establish the priorities that affect the integrity of the network.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="724"><h3>Troubleshooting Tools</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Hardware tools are used to identify network problems, network-performance trends, and to help isolate network malfunctions.</li></p>

<p><li> The most common tool for troubleshooting hardware is the digital voltmeter.</li></p>

<p><li>A time-domain reflectometer (TDR) can be used to find breaks, shorts, or imperfections in network cabling.</li></p>

<p><li>Some advanced cable test equipment can display message-frame counts, excess collisions, late collisions, error-frame counts, congestion errors, and beaconing.</li></p>

<p><li>Oscilloscopes are used with TDRs to display precise measurements of voltage and time.</li></p>

<p><li>Network monitors track all or a selected part of network traffic, while protocol analyzers perform real-time network traffic analysis.</li></p>

<p><li> Network General Sniffer can decode and interpret frames from 14 protocols.</li></p>

<p><li> Novell's LANanalyzer works like Sniffer, but is limited to NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li>The scope of a network management program depends on the size of the network, the capability of the staff, the organizational budget, and the expectations of the users.</li></p>

<p><li>Several monitoring utilities are available to manage network performance. Among these are performance monitors, network monitors, and network management protocols.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="725"><h3>Where to Find Help</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Network technology is constantly evolving. Knowing when and where to get help is an important part of being an effective network administrator.</li></p>

<p><li>Useful sources of help include bulletin board services, user groups, and periodicals.</li></p>

<p><li> Joining a local users group can provide the contacts needed to solve problems.</li></p>

<p><li> Internet services include WWW, FTP, e-mail, news, and Telnet.</li></p>

<p><li>Dial-up lines and ISDN connections are two methods by which to physically connect to the Internet.</li></p>
</ul>

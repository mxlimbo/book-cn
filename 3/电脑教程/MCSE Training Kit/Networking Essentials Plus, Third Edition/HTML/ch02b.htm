<A NAME="96"><h2>Primary Cable Types</h2></A>
<p>The vast majority of networks today are connected by some sort of wiring or cabling that
acts as a network transmission medium that carries signals between computers. Many cable types
are available to meet the varying needs and sizes of networks, from small to large.</p>

<p>Cable types can be confusing. Belden, a leading cable manufacturer, publishes a catalog that
lists more than 2200 types of cabling. Fortunately, only three major groups of cabling connect
the majority of networks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Coaxial cable</li></p>

<p><li> Twisted-pair (unshielded and shielded) cable</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber-optic cable</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The next part of this lesson describes the features and components of these three major
cable types. Understanding their differences will help you determine which type of cabling is
appropriate in a given context.</p>

<A NAME="97"><h3>Coaxial Cable</h3></A>
<p>At one time, coaxial cable was the most widely used network cabling. There were a couple of
reasons for coaxial cable's wide usage: it was relatively inexpensive, and it was light,
flexible, and easy to work with.</p>

<p>In its simplest form, <i>coaxial cable</i> consists of a core of copper wire surrounded by
insulation, a braided metal shielding, and an outer cover. Figure 2.1 shows the various
components that make up a coaxial cable.</p>

<p>The term <i>shielding</i> refers to the woven or stranded metal mesh (or other material)
that surrounds some types of cabling. Shielding protects transmitted data by absorbing stray
electronic signals, called <i>noise</i>, so that they do not get onto the cable and distort the
data. Cable that contains one layer of foil insulation and one layer of braided metal shielding
is referred to as <i>dual shielded</i>. For environments that are subject to higher
interference, quad shielding is available. <i>Quad shielding</i> consists of two layers of foil
insulation and two layers of braided metal shielding.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.1</b> <i>Coaxial cable showing various layers</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The core of a coaxial cable carries the electronic signals that make up the data. This wire
core can be either solid or stranded. If the core is solid, it is usually copper.</p>

<p>Surrounding the core is a dielectric insulating layer that separates it from the wire mesh.
The braided wire mesh acts as a ground and protects the core from electrical noise and
crosstalk. (<i>Crosstalk</i> is signal overflow from an adjacent wire. For a more detailed
discussion of crosstalk, see the section Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable, later in this
lesson.)</p>

<p>The conducting core and the wire mesh must always be kept separate from each other. If they
touch, the cable will experience a <i>short</i>, and noise or stray signals on the mesh will
flow onto the copper wire. An electrical short occurs when any two conducting wires or a
conducting wire and a ground come into contact with each other. This contact causes a direct
flow of current (or data) in an unintended path. In the case of household electrical wiring, a
short will cause sparking and the blowing of a fuse or circuit breaker. With electronic devices
that use low voltages, the result is not as dramatic and is often undetectable. These
low-voltage shorts generally cause the failure of a device; and the short, in turn, destroys
the data.</p>

<p>A nonconducting outer shield&#8212;usually made of rubber, Teflon, or plastic&#8212;surrounds the entire cable.</p>

<p>Coaxial cable is more resistant to interference and attenuation than twisted-pair cabling.
As shown in Figure 2.2, <i>attenuation</i> is the loss of signal strength that begins to occur
as the signal travels farther along a copper cable.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx02.JPG" width=404 height=100 border=0>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.2</b> <i>Attenuation causes signals to deteriorate</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The stranded, protective sleeve absorbs stray electronic signals so that they do not affect
data being sent over the inner copper cable. For this reason, coaxial cabling is a good choice
for longer distances and for reliably supporting higher data rates with less sophisticated
equipment.</p>

<p><b>Types of Coaxial Cable</b></p>

<p>There are two types of coaxial cable:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Thin (thinnet) cable</li></p>

<p><li> Thick (thicknet) cable</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Which type of coaxial cable you select depends on the needs of your particular network.</p>

<p><b>Thinnet Cable</b> <i>Thinnet</i> cable is a flexible coaxial cable about 0.64 centimeters
(0.25 inches) thick. Because this type of coaxial cable is flexible and easy to work with, it
can be used in almost any type of network installation. Figure 2.3 shows thinnet cable
connected directly to a computer's network interface card (NIC).</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx03.JPG" width=274 height=158 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.3</b> <i>Close-up view of thinnet cable showing where it connects to a computer</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Thinnet coaxial cable can carry a signal for a distance of up to approximately 185 meters
(about 607 feet) before the signal starts to suffer from attenuation.</p>

<p>Cable manufacturers have agreed upon specific designations for different types of cable.
(Table 2.1 lists cable types and descriptions.) Thinnet is included in a group referred to as
the <i>RG-58</i> family and has 50ohm impedance. (<i>Impedance</i> is the resistance, measured
in ohms, to the alternating current that flows in a wire.) The principal distinguishing feature of the RG-58 family is the center core of copper. Figure 2.4 shows two examples of RG-58 cable, one with a stranded wire core and one with a solid copper core.</p>

<p><b>Thicknet Cable</b> <i>Thicknet</i> cable is a relatively rigid coaxial cable about 1.27
centimeters (0.5 inches) in diameter. Figure 2.5 shows the difference between thinnet and
thicknet cable. Thicknet cable is sometimes referred to as Standard Ethernet because it was the
first type of cable used with the popular network architecture Ethernet. Thicknet cable's
copper core is thicker than a thinnet cable core.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02xx05x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02xx05.JPG" width=404 height=85 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.5</b> <i>Thicknet cable has a thicker core than thinnet cable</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The thicker the copper core, the farther the cable can carry signals. This means that
thicknet can carry signals farther than thinnet cable. Thicknet cable can carry a signal for
500 meters (about 1640 feet). Therefore, because of thicknet's ability to support data
transfer over longer distances, it is sometimes used as a backbone to connect several smaller
thinnet-based networks.</p>

<p>Figure 2.6 shows a device called a transceiver. A <i>transceiver</i> connects the thinnet
coaxial cable to the larger thicknet coaxial cable. A transceiver designed for thicknet
Ethernet includes a connector known as a <i>vampire tap,</i> or a piercing tap, to make the
actual physical connection to the thicknet core. This connector is pierced through the
insulating layer and makes direct contact with the conducting core. Connection from the
transceiver to the NIC is made using a transceiver cable (drop cable) to connect to the <i>
attachment unit interface</i> (AUI) port connector on the card. An AUI port connector for
thicknet is also known as a <i>Digital Intel Xerox (DIX)</i> <i>connector</i> (named for the
three companies that developed it and its related standards) or as a DB-15 connector.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.6</b> <i>Thicknet cable transceiver with detail of a vampire tap piercing the core</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Thinnet vs. Thicknet Cable</b> As a general rule, the thicker the cable, the more
difficult it is to work with. Thin cable is flexible, easy to install, and relatively
inexpensive. Thick cable does not bend easily and is, therefore, harder to install. This is
a consideration when an installation calls for pulling cable through tight spaces such as
conduits and troughs. Thick cable is more expensive than thin cable, but will carry a signal
farther.</p>

<p><b>Coaxial-Cable Connection Hardware</b></p>

<p>Both thinnet and thicknet cable use a connection component, known as a <i>BNC connector</i>,
to make the connections between the cable and the computers. There are several important
components in the BNC family, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>The BNC cable connector</b> Figure 2.7 shows a BNC cable connector. The BNC cable connector is either soldered or crimped to the end of a cable.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.7</b> <i>BNC cable connector</i><!--/caption-->
</p>



<p><li><b>The BNC T connector</b> Figure 2.8 shows a BNC T connector. This connector joins the network interface card (NIC) in the computer to the network cable.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.8</b> <i>BNC T connector</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><li><b>The BNC barrel connector</b> Figure 2.9 shows a BNC barrel connector. This connector is used to join two lengths of thinnet cable to make one longer length.</li></p>

</p>



<p><li> <b>The BNC terminator</b> Figure 2.10 shows a BNC terminator. A BNC terminator
closes each end of the bus cable to absorb stray signals. Otherwise, as we saw in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>, &quot;Introduction to Networking,&quot; the signal will bounce and all network activity will
stop.</li></p>

<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The origin of the acronym &quot;BNC&quot; is unclear, and there have
been many names ascribed to these letters, from &quot;British Naval Connector&quot; to
&quot;Bayonet Neill-Councelman.&quot; Because there is no consensus on the proper name and
because the technology industry universally refers to these simply as BNC-type connectors, in
this book we will refer to this family of hardware simply as BNC.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Coaxial-Cable Grades and Fire Codes</b></p>

<p>The type of cable grade that you should use depends on where the cables will be laid in your
office. Coaxial cables come in two grades:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) grade</li></p>

<p><li> Plenum grade</li></p>
</ul>

<p><i>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)</i> is a type of plastic used to construct the insulation and
cable jacket for most types of coaxial cable. PVC coaxial cable is flexible and can be easily
routed through the exposed areas of an office. However, when it burns, it gives off poisonous
gases.</p>

<p>A <i>plenum</i> is the shallow space in many buildings between the false ceiling and the
floor above; it is used to circulate warm and cold air through the building. Figure 2.11 shows
a typical office and where to use&#8212;or not use&#8212;PVC and plenum-grade cables. Fire codes
give very specific instructions about the type of wiring that can be routed through this area,
because any smoke or gas in the plenum will eventually blend with the air breathed by everyone
in the building.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02xx11x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02xx11.JPG" width=404 height=392 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.11</b> <i>Plenum-grade cabling is required in the plenum by fire codes</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Plenum-grade cabling contains special materials in its insulation and cable jacket. These
materials are certified to be fire resistant and produce a minimum amount of smoke; this
reduces poisonous chemical fumes. Plenum cable can be used in the plenum area and in vertical
runs (for example, in a wall) without conduit. However, plenum cabling is more expensive and
less flexible than PVC cable.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
You should consult your local fire and electrical codes for specific
regulations and requirements for running networking cable in your office.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Coaxial-Cabling Considerations</b></p>

<p>Consider the following coaxial capabilities when making a decision about which type of
cabling to use.</p>

<p>Use coaxial cable if you need a medium that can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Transmit voice, video, and data.</li></p>

<p><li>Transmit data for greater distances than is possible with less expensive cabling.</li></p>

<p><li> Offer a familiar technology with reasonable data security.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="98"><h3>Twisted-Pair Cable</h3></A>
<p>In its simplest form, <i>twisted-pair cable</i> consists of two insulated strands of copper
wire twisted around each other. Figure 2.12 shows the two types of twisted-pair cable: <i>
unshielded twisted-pair</i> <i>(UTP)</i> and <i>shielded twisted-pair</i> <i>(STP)</i>
cable.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02xx12x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02xx12.JPG" width=404 height=121 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.12</b> <i>Unshielded twisted-pair and shielded twisted-pair cables</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>A number of twisted-pair wires are often grouped together and enclosed in a protective
sheath to form a cable. The total number of pairs in a cable varies. The twisting cancels out
electrical noise from adjacent pairs and from other sources such as motors, relays, and
transformers.</p>

<p><b>Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable</b></p>

<p>UTP, using the 10BaseT specification, is the most popular type of twisted-pair cable and is
fast becoming the most popular LAN cabling. The maximum cable length segment is 100 meters,
about 328 feet.</p>

<p>Traditional UTP cable, as shown in Figure 2.13, consists of two insulated copper wires. UTP
specifications govern how many twists are permitted per foot of cable; the number of twists
allowed depends on the purpose to which the cable will be put. In North America, UTP cable is
the most commonly used cable for existing telephone systems and is already installed in many
office buildings.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx13.JPG" width=313 height=114 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.13</b> <i>UTP cable</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The 568A Commercial Building Wiring Standard of the Electronic Industries Association and
the Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) specifies the type of UTP cable that is
to be used in a variety of building and wiring situations. The objective is to ensure
consistency of products for customers. These standards include five categories of UTP:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Category 1</b> This refers to traditional UTP telephone cable that can carry voice but not data transmissions. Most telephone cable prior to 1983 was Category 1 cable.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Category 2</b> This category certifies UTP cable for data transmissions up to 4 megabits per second (Mbps). It consists of four twisted pairs of copper wire.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Category 3</b> This category certifies UTP cable for data transmissions up to 16 Mbps. It consists of four twisted pairs of copper wire with three twists per foot.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Category 4</b> This category certifies UTP cable for data transmissions up to 20 Mbps. It consists of four twisted pairs of copper wire.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Category 5</b> This category certifies UTP cable for data transmissions up to 100 Mbps. It consists of four twisted pairs of copper wire.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Most telephone systems use a type of UTP. In fact, one reason why UTP is so popular is
because many buildings are prewired for twisted-pair telephone systems. As part of the
prewiring process, extra UTP is often installed to meet future cabling needs. If preinstalled
twisted-pair cable is of sufficient grade to support data transmission, it can be used in a
computer network. Caution is required, however, because common telephone wire might not have
the twisting and other electrical characteristics required for clean, secure, computer data
transmission.</p>

<p>One potential problem with all types of cabling is crosstalk. Figure 2.14 shows crosstalk
between two UTP cables. (As discussed earlier in this lesson, crosstalk is defined as signals
from one line interfering with signals from another line.) UTP is particularly susceptible to
crosstalk, but the greater the number of twists per foot of cable, the more effective the
protection against crosstalk.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.14</b> <i> Crosstalk occurs when signals from one line bleed into another line</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable</b></p>

<p>STP cable uses a woven copper-braid jacket that is more protective and of a higher quality
than the jacket used by UTP. Figure 2.15 shows a two-twisted-pair STP cable. STP also uses a
foil wrap around each of the wire pairs. This gives STP excellent shielding to protect the
transmitted data from outside interference, which in turn allows it to support higher
transmission rates over longer distances than UTP.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx15.JPG" width=286 height=133 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.15</b> <i>STP cable</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Twisted-Pair Cabling Components</b></p>

<p>While we have defined twisted-pair cabling by the number of twists and its ability to
transmit data, additional components are necessary to complete an installation. As it is with
telephone cabling, a twisted-pair cable network requires connectors and other hardware to
ensure proper installation.</p>

<p><b>Connection hardware</b> Twisted-pair cabling uses RJ-45 telephone connectors to connect to
a computer. These are similar to RJ-11 telephone connectors. An RJ-45 connector is shown in
Figure 2.16. Although RJ-11 and RJ-45 connectors look alike at first glance, there are crucial
differences between them.</p>

<p>The RJ-45 connector is slightly larger and will not fit into the RJ-11 telephone jack. The
RJ-45 connector houses eight cable connections, while the RJ-11 houses only four.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx16.JPG" width=258 height=254 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.16</b> <i>RJ-45 connector and jack</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Several components are available to help organize large UTP installations and make them
easier to work with. Figure 2.17 shows various twisted-pair cabling components.</p>

<p><b>Distribution racks and rack shelves</b> Distribution racks and rack shelves can create
more room for cables where there isn't much floor space. Using them is a good way to
organize a network that has a lot of connections.</p>

<p><b>Expandable patch panels</b> These come in various versions that support up to 96 ports and
transmission speeds of up to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p><b>Jack couplers</b> These single or double RJ-45 jacks snap into patch panels and wall
plates and support data rates of up to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p><b>Wall plates</b> These support two or more couplers.</p>

<p><b>Twisted-Pair Cabling Considerations</b></p>

<p>Use twisted-pair cable if:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Your LAN is under budget constraints.</li></p>

<p><li>You want a relatively easy installation in which computer connections are simple.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Do not use twisted-pair cable if:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Your LAN requires a high level of security and you must be absolutely sure of data integrity.</li></p>

<p><li> You must transmit data over long distances at high speeds.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="99"><h3>Fiber-Optic Cable</h3></A>
<p>In <i>fiber-optic cable</i>, optical fibers carry digital data signals in the form of
modulated pulses of light. This is a relatively safe way to send data because, unlike
copper-based cables that carry data in the form of electronic signals, no electrical impulses
are carried over the fiber-optic cable. This means that fiberoptic cable cannot be tapped, and
its data cannot be stolen.</p>

<p>Fiber-optic cable is good for very high-speed, high-capacity data transmission because of
the purity of the signal and lack of signal attenuation.</p>

<p><b>Fiber-Optic Cable Composition</b></p>

<p>An optical fiber consists of an extremely thin cylinder of glass, called the <i>core</i>,
surrounded by a concentric layer of glass, known as the <i>cladding</i>. The fibers are
sometimes made of plastic. Plastic is easier to install, but cannot carry the light pulses for
as long a distance as glass.</p>

<p>Because each glass strand passes signals in only one direction, a cable includes two strands
in separate jackets. One strand transmits and one receives. A reinforcing layer of plastic
surrounds each glass strand, and Kevlar fibers provide strength. See Figure 2.18 for an
illustration of fiber-optic cable. The Kevlar fibers in the fiber-optic connector are placed
between the two cables. Just as their counterparts (twisted-pair and coaxial) are, fiber-optic
cables are encased in a plastic coating for protection.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.18</b> <i>Fiber-optic cable</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Fiber-optic cable transmissions are not subject to electrical interference and are extremely
fast, currently transmitting about 100 Mbps with demonstrated rates of up to 1 gigabit per
second (Gbps). They can carry a signal&#8212;the light pulse&#8212;for many miles.</p>

<p><b>Fiber-Optic Cabling Considerations</b></p>

<p>Use fiber-optic cable if you:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Need to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances in very secure media.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Do not use fiber-optic cable if you:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Are under a tight budget.</li></p>

<p><li>Do not have the expertise available to properly install it and connect devices to it.</li></p>
</ul>




<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Pricing for fiber-optic cable is competitive with high-end copper
cabling. Fiber-optic cable has become increasingly easier to work with, and polishing and
terminating techniques now require fewer parts and less expertise than just a few years
ago.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="100"><h2>Signal Transmission</h2></A>
<p>Two techniques can be used to transmit the encoded signals over cable: baseband and
broadband transmission.</p>

<A NAME="101"><h3>Baseband Transmission</h3></A>
<p><i>Baseband systems</i> use digital signaling over a single channel. Signals flow in
the form of discrete pulses of electricity or light. Figure 2.19 shows a baseband transmission
with a bidirectional digital wave. With baseband transmission, the entire communication channel
capacity is used to transmit a single data signal. The digital signal uses the complete
bandwidth of the cable, which constitutes a single channel. The term <i>bandwidth</i> refers to
the data transfer capacity, or speed of transmission, of a digital communications system as

<p>As the signal travels along the network cable, it gradually decreases in strength and can
become distorted. If the cable length is too long, the received signal can be unrecognizable or
misinterpreted.</p>

<p>As a safeguard, baseband systems sometimes use repeaters to receive incoming signals and
retransmit them at their original strength and definition. This increases the practical length
of a cable.</p>

<A NAME="102"><h3>Broadband Transmission</h3></A>
<p><i>Broadband systems</i>, as shown in Figure 2.20, use analog signaling and a range of
frequencies. With analog transmission, the signals are continuous and nondiscrete. Signals flow
across the physical medium in the form of electromagnetic or optical waves. With broadband
transmission, signal flow is unidirectional.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx20.JPG" width=299 height=63 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.20</b> <i>Broadband transmission showing unidirectional analog wave</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>If sufficient total bandwidth is available, multiple analog transmission systems, such as
cable television and network transmissions, can be supported simultaneously on the same
cable.</p>

<p>Each transmission system is allocated a part of the total bandwidth. All devices associated
with a given transmission system, such as all computers using a LAN cable, must then be tuned
so that they use only the frequencies that are within the allocated range.</p>

<p>While baseband systems use repeaters, broadband systems use amplifiers to regenerate analog
signals at their original strength.</p>

<p>In broadband transmission, signals flow in one direction only, so there must be two paths
for data flow in order for a signal to reach all devices. There are two common ways to do
this:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Through mid-split broadband configuration, the bandwidth is divided into
two channels, each using a different frequency or range of frequencies. One channel transmits
signals; the other receives signals.</li></p>

<p><li>In dual-cable broadband configuration, each device is attached to two cables. One cable is used to send, and the other is used to receive.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="103"><h2>Increasing Bandwidth Performance</h2></A>
<p>Increasing the speed of data transmission is a priority as network sizes and data traffic
increase. By maximizing the use of the data channel, we can exchange more data in less time.
The most basic form of data or information transmission is called <i>simplex</i>. This means
that data is sent in one direction only, from sender to receiver. A simplex transmission is
shown in Figure 2.21. Examples of simplex transmission are radio and television. With simplex
transmission, problems encountered during the transmission are not detected and corrected.
Senders cannot even be sure that the data is received.</p>

<img src="images/F02xx21.JPG" width=236 height=242 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.21</b> <i>A simplex transmission</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>In the next level of data transmission, called <i>half-duplex transmission</i>, data is sent
in both directions, but in only one direction at a time. Examples of technology that uses
half-duplex communication are shortwave radio and walkie-talkies. Figure 2.22 shows a
half-duplex transmission. With half-duplex transmission, you can incorporate error detection
and request that any bad data be resent. Surfing the World Wide Web is a form of half-duplex
data transmission. You send a request for a Web page and then wait while it is being sent back
to you. Most modem connections use half-duplex data transmission.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.22</b> <i>A half-duplex transmission</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The most efficient method of transmitting data is to use a <i>full-duplex transmission</i>,
in which data can be transmitted and received at the same time. A good example is a cable
connection that not only allows you to receive TV channels, but also supports telephone and
Internet connection. A telephone is a full-duplex device because it allows both parties to talk
at the same time. Figure 2.23 shows full-duplex communication. Modems, by design, are
half-duplex devices. They either send or receive data, switching between transmission mode and
receiving mode. You can create a full-duplex modem channel by using two modems and two
telephone lines. The only requirement is that both computers be connected and configured to
support this type of communication.</p>

<A NAME="104"><h2>The IBM Cabling System</h2></A>
<p>IBM has developed its own cabling system, complete with its own numbers, standards,
specifications, and designations. Many of these parameters, however, are similar to non-IBM
specifications.</p>

<p>IBM introduced its cabling system in 1984. The purpose of this system was to ensure that the
cabling and connectors would meet the specifications of their equipment. The IBM specification
includes the following components:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Cable connectors</li></p>

<p><li> Face plates</li></p>

<p><li> Distribution panels</li></p>

<p><li> Cable types</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The one IBM cabling component that is unique is the IBM connector, which is different from
standard BNC or other connectors. These are IBM Type A connectors, known elsewhere as universal
data connectors. They are neither male nor female; you can connect one to another by flipping
either one over. These IBM connectors require special faceplates and distribution panels to
accommodate their unique shape.</p>

<p>The IBM cabling system classifies cable into types. For example, in the IBM system, Category
3 cable (voice-grade UTP cable) is referred to as Type 3. (Table 2.2 compares the IBM
cabling-system type names with standard cable type names.) The cable definitions specify which
cable is appropriate for a given application or environment. The wire indicated in the system
conforms to American Wire Gauge (AWG) standards.</p>

<p><b>AWG: The Standard Cable Measurement</b></p>

<p>Cable measurements are often expressed as numbers, followed by the initials AWG. (<i>AWG</i>
is a measurement system for wire that specifies its thickness.) As the thickness of the wire
increases, the AWG number decreases. Telephone wire is often used as a reference point; it has
a thickness of 22 AWG. A wire of 14 AWG is thicker than telephone wire, and wire of 26 AWG is
thinner than telephone wire.</p>

<A NAME="105"><h2>Selecting Cabling</h2></A>
<p>To determine which cabling is the best for a particular site you need to answer the
following questions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> How heavy will the network traffic be?</li></p>

<p><li> What level of security does the network require?</li></p>

<p><li> What distances must the cable cover?</li></p>

<p><li> What are the cable options?</li></p>

<p><li> What is the budget for cabling?</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The better the cable protects against internal and external electrical noise, the farther
and faster the cable will carry a clear signal. However, the better the speed, clarity, and
security of the cable, the higher the cabling cost.</p>

<A NAME="106"><h3>Cabling Considerations</h3></A>
<p>As with most network components, there are trade-offs with the type of cable you purchase.
If you work for a large organization and choose the least expensive cable, the accountants
might initially be pleased, but you might soon notice that the LAN is inadequate in both
transmission speed and data security.</p>

<p>Which cabling you select will depend on the needs of a particular site. The cabling you
purchase to set up a LAN for a small business has different requirements from those of a larger
organization, such as a major banking institution.</p>

<p>In the rest of this section, we examine some of the considerations that affect cabling price
and performance. 

<p>Table 2.3 provides comparative information on cabling types. </p>

<p><b>Installation Logistics</b></p>

<p>How easy is the cable to install and work with? In a small installation where distances are
short and security isn't a major issue, it does not make sense to choose thick, cumbersome,
and expensive cable.</p>

<p><b>Shielding</b></p>

<p>The level of shielding required will affect cable cost. Almost every network uses some form
of shielded cable. The noisier the area in which the cable is run, the more shielding will be
required. The same shielding in a plenum-grade cable will be more expensive as well.</p>

<p><b>Crosstalk</b></p>

<p>Crosstalk and noise can cause serious problems in large networks where data integrity is
crucial. Inexpensive cabling has low resistance to outside electrical fields generated by power
lines, motors, relays, and radio transmitters. This makes it susceptible to both noise and
crosstalk.</p>

<p><b>Transmission Rates</b></p>

<p>Transmission rates are measured in megabits per second. A standard reference point for
current LAN transmission over copper cable is 100 Mbps. Fiber-optic cable transmits at more
than 1 Gbps.</p>

<p><b>Cost</b></p>

<p>Higher grades of cables can carry data securely over long distances, but they are relatively
expensive; lower-grade cables, which provide less data security over shorter distances, are
relatively inexpensive.</p>

<p><b>Signal Attenuation</b></p>

<p>Different cable types have different rates of attenuation; therefore, cable specifications
recommend specific length limits for the different types. If a signal suffers too much
attenuation, the receiving computer will be unable to interpret it. Most networks have
error-checking systems that will generate a retransmission if the signal is too weak to be
understood. However, retransmission takes time and slows down the network.</p>

<A NAME="108"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Three primary types of cables are used with networks: coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic.</li></p>

<p><li> Coaxial cable comes in two varieties: thinnet and thicknet.</li></p>

<p><li>Thinnet cable is about 0.64 centimeters thick (0.25 inches) and can carry a signal for a distance of up to 185 meters (607 feet).</li></p>

<p><li>Thicknet cable is about 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) in diameter and can carry a signal for a distance of up to 500 meters (1640 feet).</li></p>

<p><li> The BNC connector is used with both thinnet and thicknet cables.</li></p>

<p><li> Coaxial cables come in two grades, classified according to how they will be used:
PVC-grade cable is used in exposed areas; plenum-grade cable has a fire-safety rating and is
used in enclosed areas such as ceilings and walls.</li></p>

<p><li> Twisted-pair cable can be either shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP).</li></p>

<p><li>The number of twists per unit of length and the protective shielding provide protection from interference.</li></p>

<p><li> Twisted-pair cables conform to five standards, called categories. Each category
provides specifications for increasing the speed of data transmission and resistance to
interference.</li></p>

<p><li>Twisted-pair cables use RJ-45 telephone connectors to connect to computers and hubs.</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber-optic cables use light to carry digital signals.</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber-optic cables provide the greatest protection from noise and intrusion.</li></p>

<p><li> Data signals can be either baseband or broadband.</li></p>

<p><li> Baseband transmission uses digital signals over a single frequency.</li></p>

<p><li> Broadband transmission uses analog signals over a range of frequencies.</li></p>

<p><li>IBM uses its own system of cabling and standards, but follows the same basic technology as other cables.</li></p>

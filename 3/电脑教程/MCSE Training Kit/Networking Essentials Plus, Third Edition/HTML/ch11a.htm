<A NAME="594"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons for networking is to be able to share printers among
workstations. Network printers are expensive and draw extensively on electrical resources;
however, a single user is likely to require a printer only intermittently. By sharing the
printer among many users, considerable savings in cost and energy are achieved. In this
chapter, we cover the devices and management of network printers and take a look at fax
modems.</p>

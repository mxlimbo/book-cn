<A NAME="286"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<P>As we have seen in the previous chapters, many software and hardware manufacturers
supply products for linking computers in a network. Networking is fundamentally a form of
communication, so the need for manufacturers to take steps to ensure that their products could
interact became apparent early in the development of networking technology. As networks and
suppliers of networking products have spread across the world, the need for standardization
has only increased. To address the issues surrounding standardization, several independent
organizations have created standard design specifications for computer-networking products.
When these standards are adhered to, communication is possible between hardware and software
products produced by a variety of vendors. This chapter explores these standards in
detail.</P>

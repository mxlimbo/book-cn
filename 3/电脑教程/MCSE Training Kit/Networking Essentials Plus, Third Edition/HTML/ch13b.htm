<A NAME="679"><h1>Lesson 1: Understanding the Problem</h1></A>
<p>This lesson aims to give you the tools you need to become a skilled network problem solver.
If you approach a network problem with a plan of action, the cause and resolution will be
easier to find. Here, you will learn to apply a structured approach to divide a network into
functional units and then identify the problem.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Prepare a plan of action to research a network problem.</li></p>

<p><li> Conduct the research needed to isolate the problem.</li></p>

<p><li> Use a structured approach to identify a network problem.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify the severity of a network problem based on its initial symptoms.</li></p>

<A NAME="680"><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></A>
<p>Troubleshooting is perhaps the most difficult task that computer professionals face. Added
to the need to get to the bottom of a problem afflicting the network is the pressure to do so
as quickly as possible. Computers never seem to fail at a convenient time. Failures occur in
the middle of a job or when there are deadlines, and pressures to fix the problem immediately
are intense.</p>

<p>After a problem has been diagnosed, locating resources and following the procedures required
to correct the problem are straightforward. But before that diagnosis occurs, it is essential
to isolate the true cause of the problem from irrelevant factors.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting is more of an art form than an exact science. However, to be efficient and
effective as a troubleshooter, you must approach the problem in an organized and methodical
manner. Remember that you are looking for the cause, not its symptoms; yet frequently, problems
as originally reported are just symptoms and not the true cause. As a troubleshooter you need
to learn to quickly and confidently eliminate as many alternative causes as possible. This will
allow you to focus on the things that might be the cause of the problem. To do this, you must
take a systematic approach.</p>

<p>The process of troubleshooting a computer network problem can be divided into five
steps.</p>

<A NAME="681"><h3>Step 1: Defining the Problem</h3></A>
<p>The first phase is the most critical, yet most often ignored. Without a complete
understanding of the entire problem, you can spend a great deal of time working on the
symptoms, without getting to the cause. The only tools required for this phase are a pad of paper, a pen (or
pencil), and good listening skills.</p>

<p>Listening to the client or network user is your best source of information. Remember that
while you might know how the network functions and be able to find the technical cause of the
failure, those operating the network on a daily basis were there before and after the problem
started and probably recall the events that led up to the failure. By drawing on their
experience with the problem, you can get a head start on narrowing down the possible causes. To
help identify the problem, list the sequence of events, as they occurred, before the failure.
You might want to create a form with these questions (and others specific to the situation) to
help organize your notes.</p>

<p>Some general questions to ask might include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> When did you first notice the problem or error?</li></p>

<p><li> Has the computer recently been moved?</li></p>

<p><li> Have there been any recent software or hardware changes?</li></p>

<p><li>Has anything happened to the workstation? Was it dropped or was something dropped on it? Were coffee or soda spilled on the keyboard?</li></p>

<p><li>When exactly does the problem or error occur? During the startup process? After lunch? Only on Monday mornings? After sending an e-mail message?</li></p>

<p><li>Can you reproduce the problem or error? If so, how do you reproduce the problem?</li></p>

<p><li> What does the problem or error look like?</li></p>

<p><li>Describe any changes in the computer (such as noises, screen changes, disk activity lights).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Users&#8212;even those with little or no technical background&#8212;can be helpful in
collecting information if they are questioned effectively. Ask users what the network is doing
or not doing that makes them think it's not functioning correctly. User observations that
can be clues to the underlying cause of a network problem include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> &quot;The network is really slow.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> &quot;I cannot connect to the server.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> &quot;I was connected to the server but I lost the connection.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> &quot;One of my applications will not run.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> &quot;I cannot print.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>

<p>As you continue to ask questions, you can begin to narrow your focus, as the following list
illustrates:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Are all users affected or only one?</li></p>

<p>If only one user has a problem, the user's workstation is probably the cause.</p>

<p><li> Are the symptoms constant or intermittent?</li></p>

<p>Intermittent symptoms are a sign of failing hardware.</p>

<p><li> Did the problem exist before an operating system upgrade?</li></p>

<p>Any change in operating system software can cause new problems.</p>

<p><li> Does the problem appear with all applications or only one?</li></p>

<p>If only one application causes problems, focus on the application.</p>

<p><li> Is this problem similar to a previous problem?</li></p>

<p>If a similar problem occurred in the past, there might be a documented solution.</p>

<p><li> Are there new users on the network?</li></p>

<p>Increased traffic can cause logon and processing delays.</p>

<p><li> Is there new equipment on the network?</li></p>

<p>Check to verify that new network equipment has been correctly configured.</p>

<p><li> Was a new application installed before the problem occurred?</li></p>

<p>Installation and training issues can cause application problems.</p>

<p><li> Has any of the equipment been moved recently?</li></p>

<p>The moved equipment might not be connected to the network.</p>

<p><li> Which manufacturers' products are involved?</li></p>

<p>Some vendors offer telephone, online, or onsite support.</p>

<p><li>Is there a history of incompatibility among certain vendors and certain components such as cards, hubs, disk drives, software, or network operating software?</li></p>


<p>There might be a documented solution on the vendor's Web site.</p>

<p><li> Has anyone else attempted to solve this problem?</li></p>

<p>Check for documented repairs and ask coworkers about attempted repairs.</p>
</ul>

<A NAME="682"><h3>Step 2: Isolating the Cause</h3></A>
<p>The next step is to isolate the problem. Begin by eliminating the most obvious problems and
work toward the more complex and obscure. Your purpose is to narrow your search down to one or
two general categories.</p>

<p>Be sure to observe the failure yourself. If possible, have someone demonstrate the failure
to you. If it is an operator-induced problem, it is important to observe <i>how</i> it is
created, as well as the results.</p>

<p>The most difficult problems to isolate are those which are intermittent and that never seem
to occur when you are present. The only way to resolve these is to 
re-create the set of circumstances that cause the failure. Sometimes, eliminating causes that
are not the problem is the best you can do. This process takes time and patience. The user also
needs to keep detailed records of what is being done before and when the failure occurs. It can
help to tell the user to refrain from doing <i>anything</i> with the computer when the problem
recurs, except to call you. That way, the &quot;evidence&quot; won't be disturbed.</p>

<p>While the information collected provides the foundation for isolating the problem, the
administrator should also refer to documented baseline information to compare with current
network behavior. In <A HREF="ch12a.htm#622">Chapter 12</A>, &quot;Administering Change,&quot; we learned how to document a
network by creating a baseline. Now it is time to put that knowledge to work. Rerun tests under
the same set of conditions as prevailed when you created the baseline, then compare the two
results. Any changes between the two can indicate the source of the problem.</p>

<p>Information gathering involves scanning the network and looking for an obvious cause of the
problem. A quick scan should include a review of the documented history of the network to
determine if the problem has occurred before and, if so, whether there is a recorded
solution.</p>

<A NAME="683"><h3>Step 3: Planning the Repair</h3></A>
<p>After you have narrowed your search down to a few categories, the final process of
elimination begins.</p>

<p>Create a planned approach to isolating the problem based on your knowledge at this point.
Start by trying out the most obvious or easiest solution to eliminate and continue toward the
more difficult and complex. It is important to record each step of the process; document every
action and its results.</p>

<p>After you have created your plan, it is important to follow it through as designed. Jumping
ahead and randomly trying things out of order can often lead to problems. If the first plan is
not successful (always a possibility), create a new plan based on what you discovered with the
previous plan. Be sure to refer to, reexamine, and reassess any assumptions you might have made
in the previous plan.</p>

<p>After you have located the problem, either repair the defect or replace the defective
component. If the problem is software-based, be sure to record the &quot;before&quot; and
&quot;after&quot; changes.</p>

<A NAME="684"><h3>Step 4: Confirming the Results</h3></A>
<p>No repair is complete without confirmation that the job has been successfully concluded. You
need to make sure that the problem no longer exists. Ask the user to test the solution and
confirm the results. You should also make sure that the fix did not generate new problems. Be
sure to confirm not only the problem you fixed, but also that what you have done has not had a
negative impact on any other aspect of the network.</p>

<A NAME="685"><h3>Step 5: Documenting the Outcome</h3></A>
<p>Finally, document the problem and the repair. Recording what you've learned will provide
you with invaluable information. There is no substitute for experience in troubleshooting, and
each new problem presents you with an opportunity to expand that experience. Keeping a copy of
the repair procedure in your technical library can be useful when the problem (or one like it)
occurs again. Documenting the troubleshooting process is one way to build, retain, and share
experience.</p>

<p>Remember that any changes you have made might have affected the baseline. You might need to
update the network baseline in anticipation of future problems and needs.</p>

<A NAME="686"><h2>Segmenting the Problem</h2></A>
<p>If the initial review of network statistics and symptoms does not expose an obvious problem,
dividing the network into smaller parts to isolate the cause is the next step in the
troubleshooting process. The first question to ask is whether the problem stems from the hardware, or
the software. If the problem appears to be hardware-based, start by looking at only one
segment of the network, then looking at only one type of hardware.</p>

<p>Check the hardware and network components including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> NICs.</li></p>

<p><li> Cabling and connectors.</li></p>

<p><li> Clients/workstations.</li></p>

<p><li>Connectivity components such as repeaters, bridges, routers, brouters, and gateways.</li></p>

<p><li> Hubs.</li></p>

<p><li> Protocols.</li></p>

<p><li> Servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Users.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Often, isolating or removing a portion of the network will help to get the rest of the
network up and operational again. If removing a portion solved the problem for the rest of the
network, the search for the problem can be focused on the part that was removed.</p>

<p>Network protocols require special attention because they are designed to bypass network
problems and attempt to overcome network faults. Most protocols use what's known as
&quot;retry logic,&quot; in which the software attempts an automatic recovery from a problem.
This becomes noticeable through slow network performance as the network makes new and repeated
attempts to perform correctly. Failing hardware devices, such as hard drives and controllers,
will use retry logic by repeatedly interrupting the CPU for more processing time to complete
their task.</p>

<p>When you are assessing hardware performance problems, use the information obtained from the
hardware baselines to compare against the current symptoms and performance.</p>

<A NAME="687"><h2>Isolating the Problem</h2></A>
<p>After you have gathered the information, rank the list of possible causes in order,
beginning with the most likely and moving to the least likely cause of the problem. Then select
the most likely candidate from the list of possible causes, test it and see if that is the
problem. Start from the most obvious and work to the most difficult. For example, if you
suspect that a faulty network interface card (NIC) in one of the computers is the cause of the
trouble, replace it with a NIC that is known to be in good working order.</p>

<A NAME="688"><h2>Setting Priorities</h2></A>
<p>A fundamental element in network problem solving is setting priorities. Everyone wants his
or her computer fixed first, so setting priorities is not an easy job. While the simplest
approach is to prioritize on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis, this does not always
work, as some failures are more critical to resolve than others. Therefore, the initial step is
to assess the problem's impact on the ability to maintain operations. For example, a
monitor that is gradually getting fuzzy over several days would have a lower priority to
address than the inability to access the payroll file server prior to a check run.</p>

<A NAME="689"><h2>Exercise 13.1: Troubleshooting Problem</h2></A>
<p>Given the following scenario, describe how you would research, identify, prioritize, and
resolve this network problem:</p>

<p>The network has been running well at the site of a small manufacturer. However, a user in
the quality control division now calls to report that she is unable to get the daily status
reports printed by the printer in the department. Meanwhile, the shipping department reports
that a rerouted print job did not print in the quality control department. What is your
strategy for solving this network problem?</p>

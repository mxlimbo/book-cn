<A NAME="692"><h2>Hardware Tools</h2></A>
<p>Hardware tools were once very expensive and difficult devices to use. They are now less
expensive and easier to operate. They are helpful to identify performance trends and problems.
This section describes the most common of these tools.</p>

<A NAME="693"><h3>Digital Voltmeters</h3></A>
<p>The digital voltmeter (volt-ohm meter) is the primary all-purpose electronic measuring tool.
It is considered standard equipment for any computer or electronic technician and can reveal
far more than just the amount of voltage passing through resistance. Voltmeters can determine
if:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The cable is continuous (has no breaks).</li></p>

<p><li> The cable can carry network traffic.</li></p>

<p><li> Two parts of the same cable are exposed and touching (thereby causing shorts).</li></p>

<p><li>An exposed part of the cable is touching another conductor, such as a metal surface.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>One of the network administrator's most important functions is to confirm source voltage
for the network equipment. Most electronic equipment operates on 120 volts AC. But not all
outlets will meet these requirements. In older installations, especially in large industrial
areas, the system load can drop voltages to as low as 102 volts. Operating for long periods at
low voltages can cause electronic equipment problems. Low voltages often cause intermittent
faults. At the other end, voltage that is too high can cause immediate damage to the equipment.
In new construction, it is possible for circuits to be wired incorrectly and actually put out
220 volts AC.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
With any new location or new construction, it is important to check the
outlet voltages before connecting any electronic equipment in order to verify that they
are within an acceptable range.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="694"><h3>Time-Domain Reflectometers (TDRs)</h3></A>
<p>Time-domain reflectometers (TDRs), as shown in Figure 13.1, send sonar-like pulses along
cables to locate breaks, shorts, or imperfections. Network performance suffers when the cable
is not intact. If the TDR locates a problem, the problem is analyzed and the results are
displayed. A TDR can locate a break within a few feet of the actual separation in the cable.
Used heavily during the installation of a new network, TDRs are also invaluable in
troubleshooting and maintaining existing networks.</p>

</p>


<p>Using a TDR requires special training, and not every maintenance department will have this
equipment. However, administrators need to know the capabilities of TDRs in case the network is
experiencing media failure and it is necessary to locate a break.</p>

<A NAME="695"><h3>Advanced Cable Testers</h3></A>
<p>Advanced cable testers work beyond the physical layer of the OSI reference model (described
in <A HREF="ch05a.htm#285">Chapter 5</A>, &quot;Introducing Network Standards&quot;) in the data-link layer, network layer,
and even the transport layer. They can also display information about the condition of the
physical cable.</p>

<A NAME="696"><h3>Oscilloscopes</h3></A>
<p>Oscilloscopes are electronic instruments that measure the amount of signal voltage per unit
of time and display the result on a monitor. When used with TDRs, an oscilloscope can
display:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Shorts.</li></p>

<p><li> Sharp bends or crimps in the cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Opens (breaks in the cable).</li></p>

<p><li> Attenuation (loss of signal power).</li></p>
</ul>

<h3>Other Hardware Tools</h3>

<p>Several other versatile hardware tools can serve as useful aids to network troubleshooting.

<h3>Crossover Cables</h3>
<p>Crossover cables are used to connect two computers directly with a single patch cable. Because the send and receive wires are reversed on one end, the send wire from one computer is connected to the receive port on the other computer. Crossover cables are useful in troubleshooting network connection problems. Two computers can be directly connected, bypassing the network and making it possible to isolate and test the communication capabilities of one computer, rather than the whole network.</p>

<h3>Hardware Loopback</h3>
<p>A hardware loopback device is a serial port connector that enables you to test the communication capabilities of a computer's serial port without having to connect to another computer or peripheral device. Instead, using the loopback, data is transmitted to a line, then returned as received data. If the transmitted data does not return, the hardware loopback detects a hardware malfunction.</p>

<h3>Tone Generator and Tone Locator</h3>
<p>Tone generators are standard tools for wiring technicians in all fields. A tone generator is used to apply an alternating or continuous tone signal to a cable or a conductor. The tone generator is attached to one end of the cable in question. A matching tone locator is used to detect the correct cable at the other end of the run.</p>

<p>These tools are also able to test for wiring continuity and line polarity. They can be used to trace twisted-pair wiring, single conductors, and coaxial cables, among others. This pair of equipment is sometimes referred to as &quot;fox and hound.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="697"><h2>Software Tools</h2></A>
<p>Software tools are needed to monitor trends and identify network performance problems. This
section describes some of the more useful of these tools.</p>

<A NAME="698"><h3>Network Monitors</h3></A>
<p>Network monitors are software tools that track all or a selected part of network traffic.
They examine data packets and gather information about packet types, errors, and packet traffic
to and from each computer.</p>

<p>Network monitors are very useful for establishing part of the network baseline. After the
baseline has been established, you will be able to troubleshoot traffic problems and monitor
network usage to determine when it is time to upgrade. As an example, let's assume that
after installing a new network, you determine that network traffic is utilized at 40 percent of
its intended capacity. When you check traffic, one year later, you notice that it is now being
utilized at 80 percent capacity. If you had been monitoring it all along, you would have been
able to predict the rate of increased traffic and predict when to upgrade before failure
occurs.</p>

<A NAME="699"><h3>Protocol Analyzers</h3></A>
<p>Protocol analyzers, also called &quot;network analyzers,&quot; perform real-time network
traffic analysis using packet capture, decoding, and transmission data. Network administrators
who work with large networks rely heavily on the protocol analyzer. These are the tools used
most often to monitor network interactivity.</p>

<p>Protocol analyzers look inside the packet to identify a problem. They can also generate
statistics based on network traffic to help create a picture of the network, including the:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Cabling.</li></p>

<p><li> Software.</li></p>

<p><li> File servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Workstations.</li></p>

<p><li> Network interface cards.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Protocol analyzers have built-in TDRs, discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p>The protocol analyzer can provide insights and detect network problems including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Faulty network components.</li></p>

<p><li> Configuration or connection errors.</li></p>

<p><li> LAN bottlenecks.</li></p>

<p><li> Traffic fluctuations.</li></p>

<p><li> Protocol problems.</li></p>

<p><li> Applications that might conflict.</li></p>

<p><li> Unusual server traffic.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Protocol analyzers can identify a wide range of network behavior. They can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Identify the most active computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify computers that are sending error-filled packets. If one computer's
heavy traffic is slowing down the network, the computer should be moved to another network
segment. If a computer is generating bad packets, it should be removed and repaired.</li></p>

<p><li> View and filter certain types of packets. This is helpful for routing traffic.
Protocol analyzers can determine what type of traffic is passing across a given network
segment.</li></p>

<p><li>Track network performance to identify trends. Recognizing trends can help an administrator better plan and configure the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Check components, connections, and cabling by generating test packets and tracking the results.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify problem conditions by setting parameters to generate alerts.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="700"><h3>Network General Sniffer</h3></A>
<p>Sniffer, which is part of a family of analyzers from Network General, can decode and
interpret frames from 14 protocols including AppleTalk, Windows NT, NetWare, SNA, TCP/IP,
VINES, and X.25. Sniffer measures network traffic in kilobytes per second, frames per second,
or as a percentage of available bandwidth. It will gather LAN traffic statistics, detect faults
such as beaconing, and present this information in a profile of the LAN. Sniffer can also
identify bottlenecks by capturing frames between computers and displaying the results.</p>

<A NAME="701"><h3>Novell's LANalyzer</h3></A>
<p>The LANalyzer software performs much the same function as Sniffer but is available only on a
NetWare LAN.</p>

<A NAME="702"><h2>Monitoring and Troubleshooting Tools</h2></A>

<p>After a network has been installed and is operational, the administrator needs to make sure
it performs effectively. To do this, the administrator will need to manage and keep track of
every aspect of the network's performance.</p>

<A NAME="703"><h3>Network Management Overview</h3></A>

<p>The scope of a network management program depends on:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The size of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> The size and capabilities of the network support staff.</li></p>

<p><li> The organization's network operating budget.</li></p>

<p><li> The organization's expectations of the network.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Small peer-to-peer networks consisting of 10 or fewer computers can be monitored visually by
one support person. However, a large network or WAN might need a dedicated staff and
sophisticated equipment to perform proper network monitoring.</p>

<p>One way to ensure that the network does not fail is to observe certain aspects of its
day-to-day behavior. By consistently monitoring the network, you will notice if any areas begin
to show a decline in performance.</p>

<A NAME="704"><h3>Performance Monitors</h3></A>
<p>Most current network operating systems include a monitoring utility that will help a network
administrator keep track of a network's server performance. These monitors can view
operations in both real time and recorded time for:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Processors.</li></p>

<p><li> Hard disks.</li></p>

<p><li> Memory.</li></p>

<p><li> Network utilization.</li></p>

<p><li> The network as a whole.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>These monitors can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Record the performance data.</li></p>

<p><li> Send an alert to the network manager.</li></p>

<p><li> Start another program that can adjust the system back into acceptable ranges.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>When monitoring a network, it is important to establish a baseline, as discussed in <A HREF="ch12a.htm#622">Chapter
12</A>, &quot;Administering Change.&quot; This documentation of the network's normal operating
values should be periodically updated as changes are made to the network. The baseline
information can help you identify and monitor dramatic and subtle changes in your network's
performance.</p>

<A NAME="705"><h3>Network Monitors</h3></A>
<p>Some servers include network monitoring software. Windows NT Server, for example, includes a
diagnostic tool called Network Monitor, shown in Figure 13.2. This tool gives the administrator
the ability to capture and analyze network data streams to and from the server. This data is
used to troubleshoot potential network problems.</p>

<p>The packets of data in the data stream consist of the following information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The source address of the computer that sent the message.</li></p>

<p><li> The destination address of the computer that received the frame.</li></p>

<p><li> Headers from each protocol used to send the frame.</li></p>

<p><li> The data or a portion of the information being sent.</li></p>
</ul>

</p>


<A NAME="706"><h3>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</h3></A>
<p>Network management software follows standards created by network equipment vendors. One of
these standards is the simple network management protocol (SNMP).</p>

<p>In an SNMP environment, illustrated in Figure 13.3, programs called &quot;agents&quot; are
loaded onto each managed device. The agents monitor network traffic in order to gather
statistical data. This data is stored in a management information base (MIB).</p>

<p>SNMP components include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Hubs.</li></p>

<p><li> Servers.</li></p>

<p><li> NICs.</li></p>

<p><li> Routers and bridges.</li></p>

<p><li> Other specialized network equipment.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F13xx03x.htm')"> <img src="images/F13xx03.JPG" width=404 height=280 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 13.3</b> <i>SNMP environment showing components</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>To collect the information in a usable form, a management program console regularly polls
these agents and downloads the information from their MIBs. After the raw information has been
collected, the management program can perform two more tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Present the information in the form of graphs, maps, and charts</li></p>

<p><li> Send the information to designated database programs to be analyzed</li></p>
</ul>

<p>If any of the data falls above or below thresholds set by the manager, the management
program can notify the administrator by means of alerts on the computer or by automatically
dialing a pager number. The support staff can then use the management console program to
implement changes in the network.</p>

<h2>Lesson 1: Network Cabling</h2>

<a name="ans58"><h3>Exercise 2.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Where does this recommendation violate the UTP and 10BaseT specifications?</li></p>

<p><b>The distances for A, B, C, D, E, F, and G to the hub all exceed the maximum cable length of
100 meters (328 feet) specified by 10BaseT. Therefore, this solution will not work.</b></p>

<p><li>What type of cabling might you recommend instead?</li></p>

<p><b>You could use thinnet with a multiport repeater where the hub is in the diagram. All the
cable lengths from the hub to individual computers are less than 185 meters (607 feet). You
could also use a star-wired, fiber-optic network for this situation; the cost would compare favorably with that of a coaxial-cabling solution.</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 2: The Network Interface Card</h2>

<a name="ans59"><h3>Exercise 2.2: Troubleshooting Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>List two things that could cause the network not to function.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The answers identify some of the potential causes of the problem, but the list is
not exhaustive. Even if the answers you have written down are not listed, they might still be
correct.

<p><b>The network cable might not be correctly connected; that is, there might be a break in it
caused by adding the new computers.</b></p>

<p><b>The new cable added to service the new computers might not be the correct type for your
network.</b></p>

<p><b>The new cable added to your network might have a short in it.</b></p>

<p><b>Rough handling during the installation of the new computers might have damaged the existing
network cabling.</b></p>

<p><b>The addition of the new cable required to network the new computers might have made your
total network cable length exceed the maximum length specified for the type of network you
have.</b></p>

<p><b>The bus network might be missing a terminator. It might have been removed or fallen off
during the installation of the new computers.</b></p>

<p><li value="2"><a name="000"></a>What could you do to resolve each of the two possible causes you listed above?</li></p>

<p><b>Find and repair the break or disconnection in the cable.</b></p>

<p><b>Check the cable type of the existing cable and make sure the new cables are of the same
type. If they are of different types, replace the new cables with cables of the correct type.
For example, the original cable might be RG-58A/U and the new cables might be RG-62 /U. These
two cable types are not compatible. Replace the new cable with RG-58A/U cable.</b></p>

<p><li>How would each of your solutions repair the problems you identified (assuming that they
are able to repair the problems)?</li></p>

<p><b>Restoring cable connections will reestablish the continuity of the network cable and allow
transmissions to reach all connected network devices.</b></p>

<p><b>With all segments of the same cable type, network transmissions will be able to pass
uninterrupted from one cable segment to the next.</b></p>

<p><b>Replacing a shorted segment of the new cable with a new, tested segment will allow network
transmissions to flow correctly.</b></p>

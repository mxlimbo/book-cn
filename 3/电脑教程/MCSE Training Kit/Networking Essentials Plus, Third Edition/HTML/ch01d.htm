<A NAME="61"><h2>Designing a Network Topology</h2></A>
<p>The term <i>topology</i>, or more specifically, network topology, refers to the arrangement
or physical layout of computers, cables, and other components on the network.
&quot;Topology&quot; is the standard term that most network professionals use when they refer
to the network's basic design. In addition to the term &quot;topology,&quot; you will find
several other terms that are used to define a network's design:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Physical layout</li></p>

<p><li> Design</li></p>

<p><li> Diagram</li></p>

<p><li> Map</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A network's topology affects its capabilities. The choice of one topology over another
will have an impact on the:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Type of equipment the network needs.</li></p>

<p><li> Capabilities of the equipment.</li></p>

<p><li> Growth of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Way the network is managed.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Developing a sense of how to use the different topologies is a key to understanding the
capabilities of the different types of networks.</p>

<p>Before computers can share resources or perform other communication tasks they must be
connected. Most networks use cable to connect one computer to another.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Wireless networks connect computers without using cable. This technology
is discussed in Chapter 2 in <a href="ch02d.htm#132">Lesson 3: Wireless Networking</a>.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>However, it is not as simple as just plugging a computer into a cable connecting other
computers. Different types of cable&#8212;combined with different network cards, network
operating systems, and other components&#8212;require different types of arrangements.</p>

<p>To work well, a network topology takes planning. For example, a particular 
topology can determine not only the type of cable used but also how the cabling runs through
floors, ceilings, and walls.</p>

<p>Topology can also determine how computers communicate on the network. 
Different topologies require different communication methods, and these 
methods have a great influence on the network.</p>

<A NAME="62"><h2>Standard Topologies</h2></A>
<p>All network designs stem from four basic topologies:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Bus</li></p>

<p><li> Star</li></p>

<p><li> Ring</li></p>

<p><li> Mesh</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A <i>bus topology</i> consists of devices connected to a common, shared cable. Connecting
computers to cable segments that branch out from a single point, or hub, is referred to as
setting up a <i>star topology</i>. Connecting computers to a cable that forms a loop is
referred to as setting up a <i>ring topology</i>. A <i>mesh topology</i> connects all computers
in a network to each other with separate cables.</p>

<p>These four topologies can be combined in a variety of more complex hybrid topologies.</p>

<A NAME="63"><h3>Bus</h3></A>
<p>The bus topology is often referred to as a &quot;linear bus&quot; because the computers
are connected in a straight line. This is the simplest and most common method of networking
computers. Figure 1.15 shows a typical bus topology. It consists of a single cable called a <i>
trunk</i> (also called a backbone or segment) that connects all of the computers in the network
in a single line.</p>

accompanying this book to view a demonstration of a bus-topology connection.</p>

<p><b>Communication on the Bus</b></p>

<p>Computers on a bus topology network communicate by addressing data to a particular computer
and sending out that data on the cable as electronic signals. To understand how computers
communicate on a bus, you need to be familiar with three concepts:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Sending the signal</li></p>

<p><li> Signal bounce</li></p>

<p><li> Terminator</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Sending the Signal</b> Network data in the form of electronic signals is sent to all the
computers on the network. Only the computer whose address matches the address encoded in the
original signal accepts the information. All other computers reject the data. Figure 1.16 shows
a message being sent from 0020af151d8b to 02608c133456. Only one computer at a time can send
messages.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Run the <b>c01dem02</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the compact disc
accompanying this book to view a demonstration of how data is transferred in a bus
topology.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F01xx16x.htm')"> <img src="images/F01xx16.JPG" width=404 height=220 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.16</b> <i>Data is sent to all computers, but only the destination computer accepts it</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Because only one computer at a time can send data on a bus network, the number of computers
attached to the bus will affect network performance. The more computers there are on a bus, the
more computers will be waiting to put data on the bus and, consequently, the slower the network
will be.</p>

<p>There is no standard way to measure the impact of a given number of computers on the speed
of any given network. The effect on performance is not related solely to the number of
computers. The following is a list of factors that&#8212;in addition to the number of networked
computers&#8212;will affect the performance of a network:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Hardware capabilities of computers on the network</li></p>

<p><li> Total number of queued commands waiting to be executed</li></p>

<p><li>Types of applications (client-server or file system sharing, for example) being run on the network</li></p>

<p><li> Types of cable used on the network</li></p>

<p><li> Distances between computers on the network</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Computers on a bus either transmit data to other computers on the network or listen for data
from other computers on the network. They are not responsible for moving data from one computer
to the next. Consequently, if one computer fails, it does not affect the rest of the
network.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Run the <b>c01dem03</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a demonstration that shows how a failed computer does not affect data transmission
in a bus topology.</p>

<p><b>Signal Bounce</b> Because the data, or electronic signal, is sent to the entire network,
it travels from one end of the cable to the other. If the signal is allowed to continue
uninterrupted, it will keep bouncing back and forth along the cable and prevent other computers
from sending signals. Therefore, the signal must be stopped after it has had a chance to reach
the proper destination address.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c01dem04</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a demonstration of signal bounce.</p>

<p><b>Terminator</b> To stop the signal from bouncing, a component called a <i>terminator</i> is
placed at each end of the cable to absorb free signals. Absorbing the signal clears the cable
so that other computers can send data.</p>

<p>Both ends of each cable segment on the network must be plugged into something. For example,
a cable end can be plugged into a computer or a connector to extend the cable length. Any open
cable ends not plugged into something must be terminated to prevent signal bounce. Figure 1.17
shows a properly terminated bus topology network.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F01xx17x.htm')"> <img src="images/F01xx17.JPG" width=404 height=244 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>

<p>Run the <b>c01dem05</b> and <b>c01dem06</b> videos located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the
CD accompanying this book to view a terminator component and a demonstration of how a
terminator eliminates signal bounce.</p>

<p><b>Disrupting Network Communication</b></p>

<p>A break in the cable will occur if the cable is physically separated into two pieces or if
at least one end of the cable becomes disconnected. In either case, one or both ends of the
cable will not have a terminator, the signal will bounce, and all network activity will stop.
This is one of several possible reasons why a network will go &quot;down.&quot; Figure 1.18
shows a bus topology with a disconnected cable. This network will not work because it now has
unterminated cables.</p>

<p>The computers on the network will still be able to function as stand-alone 
computers; however, as long as the segment is broken, they will not be able to communicate with
each other or otherwise access shared resources. The computers on the down segment will attempt
to establish a connection; while they do so, workstation performance will be slower.</p>

cable of a bus-topology network.</p>

<p><b>Network Expansion</b></p>

<p>As the physical size of the site grows, the network will need to grow as well. Cable in the
bus topology can be extended by one of the two following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li> A component called a <i>barrel connector</i> can connect two pieces of cable
together to make a longer piece of cable (see Figure 1.19). However, connectors weaken the
signal and should be used sparingly. One continuous cable is preferable to connecting several
smaller ones with connectors. Using too many connectors can prevent the signal from being
correctly received.</li>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.19</b> <i>Barrel connectors can be used to combine cable segments</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<li> A device called a <i>repeater</i> can be used to connect two cables. A repeater
actually boosts the signal before it sends the signal on its way. Figure 1.20 shows a repeater
boosting a weakened signal. A repeater is better than a connector or a longer piece of cable
because it allows a signal to travel farther and still be correctly received.</li>

</ul>

<A NAME="64"><h3>Star</h3></A>
<p>In the star topology, cable segments from each computer are connected to a centralized
component called a <i>hub</i>. Figure 1.21 shows four computers and a hub connected in a star
topology. Signals are transmitted from the sending computer through the hub to all computers on
the network. This topology originated in the early days of computing when computers were
connected to a centralized mainframe computer.</p>

</p>

<p>Run the <b>c01dem09</b> and <b>c01dem10</b> videos located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the
CD accompanying this book to view demonstrations of a star topology.</p>

<p>The star network offers the advantage of centralized resources and management. However,
because each computer is connected to a central point, this topology requires a great deal of
cable in a large network installation. Also, if the central point fails, the entire network
goes down.</p>

<p>If one computer&#8212;or the cable that connects it to the hub&#8212;fails on a star network,
only the failed computer will not be able to send or receive network data. The rest of the
network continues to function normally.</p>

book to view a demonstration of what happens when a computer on a star topology network goes
down.</p>

<A NAME="65"><h3>Ring</h3></A>
<p>The ring topology connects computers on a single circle of cable. Unlike the bus topology,
there are no terminated ends. The signals travel around the loop in one direction and pass
through each computer, which can act as a repeater to boost the signal and send it on to the
next computer. Figure 1.22 shows a typical ring topology with one server and four workstations.
The failure of one computer can have an impact on the entire network.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A network's physical topology is the wire itself. A network's
logical topology is the way it carries signals on the wire.

ring-topology network.</p>

<p><b>Token Passing</b></p>

<p>One method of transmitting data around a ring is called <i>token passing</i>. (A <i>
token</i> is a special series of bits that travels around a token-ring network. Each network
has only one token.) The token is passed from computer to computer until it gets to a computer
that has data to send. Figure 1.23 shows a token ring topology with the token. The sending
computer modifies the token, puts an electronic address on the data, and sends it around the
ring.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/F01xx23.JPG" width=382 height=373 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.23</b> <i>A computer grabs the token and passes it around the ring</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The data passes by each computer until it finds the one with an address that matches the
address on the data.</p>

<p>The receiving computer returns a message to the sending computer indicating that the data
has been received. After verification, the sending computer creates a new token and releases it
on the network. The token circulates within the ring until a workstation needs it to send
data.</p>

<p>

CD accompanying this book to view demonstrations of both the logical and actual flows of token
passing on a ring topology network.</p>

<p>It might seem that token passing would take a long time, but the token actually travels at
roughly the speed of light. A token can circle a ring 200 meters (656 feet) in diameter about
477,376 times per second.</p>

book to view a demonstration of what happens when a computer on a token ring_topology network
goes down.</p>

<A NAME="66"><h3>Mesh</h3></A>
<p>A mesh topology network offers superior redundancy and reliability. In a mesh topology, each
computer is connected to every other computer by separate cabling. This configuration provides
redundant paths throughout the network so that if one cable fails, another will take over the
traffic. While ease of troubleshooting and increased reliability are definite pluses, these
networks are expensive to install because they use a lot of cabling. Often, a mesh topology
will be used in conjunction with other topologies to form a hybrid topology.</p>

</p>


<A NAME="67"><h2>Hubs</h2></A>
<p>One network component that has become standard equipment in networks is the hub. Figure 1.25
shows a hub as the central component in a star topology.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.25</b> <i>A hub is the central point in a star topology</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="68"><h3>Active Hubs</h3></A>
<p>Most hubs are active; that is, they regenerate and retransmit signals in the same way as a
repeater does. Because hubs usually have eight to twelve ports for network computers to connect
to, they are sometimes called multiport repeaters. Active hubs require electrical power to
run.</p>

<A NAME="69"><h3>Passive Hubs</h3></A>
<p>Some types of hubs are passive; examples include wiring panels or punch-down blocks. They
act as connection points and do not amplify or regenerate the signal; the signal passes through
the hub. Passive hubs do not require electrical power to run.</p>

<A NAME="70"><h3>Hybrid Hubs</h3></A>
<p>Advanced hubs that will accommodate several different types of cables are called <i>hybrid
hubs</i>. Figure 1.26 shows a main hub (the hybrid) with three sub-hubs.</p>

<p>

<A NAME="71"><h3>Hub Considerations</h3></A>
<p>Hub-based systems are versatile and offer several advantages over systems that do not use
hubs.</p>

<p>In the standard linear-bus topology, a break in the cable will take the network down. With
hubs, however, a break in any of the cables attached to the hub affects only a limited segment
of the network. Figure 1.27 shows that a break or disconnected cable affects only one
workstation while the rest of the network keeps functioning.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/F01xx27.JPG" width=341 height=386 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.27</b> <i>A break or unplugged cable takes down only the unplugged computer</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Hub-based topologies include the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Wiring systems can be changed or expanded as needed.</li></p>

<p><li> Different ports can be used to accommodate a variety of cabling types.</li></p>

<p><li> Monitoring of network activity and traffic can be centralized.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="72"><h2>Variations on the Standard Topologies</h2></A>
<p>Many working topologies are hybrid combinations of the bus, star, ring, and mesh
topologies.</p>

<A NAME="73"><h3>Star Bus</h3></A>
<p>The <i>star bus</i> is a combination of the bus and star topologies. In a star-bus topology,
several star topology networks are linked together with linear bus trunks. 
Figure 1.28 shows a typical star-bus topology.</p>

<p>If one computer goes down, it will not affect the rest of the network. The other computers
can continue to communicate. If a hub goes down, all computers on that hub are unable to
communicate. If a hub is linked to other hubs, those connections will be broken as well.</p>

<p>The <i>star ring</i> (sometimes called a star-wired ring) appears similar to the star bus.
Both the star ring and the star bus are centered in a hub that contains the actual ring or bus.
Figure 1.29 shows a star-ring network. Linear-bus trunks connect the hubs in a star bus, while
the hubs in a star ring are connected in a star pattern by the main hub.</p>

topology. However, because all computers on the network are equal (each can be both client and
server), the logical topology looks somewhat different. Figure 1.30 shows the logical topology
of a peer-to-peer network.</p>

business manager, an administrator, and four agents decides to implement a network. The company
occupies half of a small building in an office park. Their volume of business had been stable
for the past three years, but recently it has been increasing. To handle the increased business
volume, two new agents will be hired.</p>

<p>Figure 1.31 illustrates the current arrangement.</p>

</p>


<p>Everyone in the company has a computer, but the business manager has the only printer. These
computers are not connected by any form of networking. When agents need to print a document,
they must first copy the file to a floppy disk, then carry it to the business manager's
computer, where they are finally able to print it. Similarly, when staff members want to share
data, the only means available is to copy the data on one computer to a floppy disk and insert
the disk in another computer.</p>

<p>Recently, problems have arisen. The business manager is spending too much time printing
other people's documents; and it is frequently unclear which copy of a given document is
the current and authoritative version.</p>

<p>Your task is to design a network for this company.</p>

<p>To clarify the task of choosing a solution, you ask some questions.</p>

<p>Circle the most appropriate answers to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Which type of network would you suggest for this company?</li></p>
<ul>
<p><li> Peer-to-peer</li></p>

<A NAME="78"><h2>Exercise 1.2: Troubleshooting Problem</h2></A>
<p>Use the information in the next section to help you solve the troubleshooting problem that
follows.</p>

<A NAME="79"><h3>Background Information</h3></A>
<p>Choosing a network that does not meet an organization's needs leads directly to trouble.
A common problem arises from choosing a peer-to-peer network when the situation calls for a
server-based network.</p>

<p>A peer-to-peer, or workgroup, network might begin to exhibit problems with changes in the
network site. These are more likely to be logistical or operational problems than hardware or
software problems. The presence of several indicators is a sign that a peer-to-peer network is
inadequate. Possible scenarios include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Lack of centralized security is causing difficulty.</li></p>

<p><li>Users are turning off computers that are providing resources to others on the network.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>When a network's design is too limited, it cannot perform satisfactorily in some
environments. Problems can vary depending on the type of network topology in effect.</p>

<p><b>Bus Topology</b></p>

<p>A few situations will cause a bus network's termination to fail and thereby take the
network down. Possible scenarios include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A cable on the network breaks, causing each end of the cable on either side of the break to lose its termination. Signals will bounce, and this will take the network down.</li></p>

<p><li> A cable becomes loose or is disconnected, thereby separating the computer from the
network. It will also create an end that is not terminated, which in turn will cause signals to
bounce and the network to go down.</li></p>

<p><li>A terminator becomes loose; thereby creating an end that is not terminated. Signals will start to bounce and the network will go down.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Hub-Based Topology</b></p>

<p>While problems with hubs are infrequent, they do occur. Possible scenarios include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A hub drops a connection. When a computer becomes disconnected from the hub, that
computer will be off the network, but the rest of the network will continue to function
normally.</li></p>

<p><li> An active hub loses power, causing the network to stop functioning.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Ring Topology</b></p>

<p>A ring network is usually very reliable, but problems can occur. Possible scenarios include
the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> One of the cables in the ring breaks, causing the network to stop functioning
temporarily. In token-ring networks, restoring the cable will immediately restore the
network.</li></p>

<p><li> One of the cables in the ring becomes disconnected, causing the network to
temporarily stop functioning. In token-ring networks, restoring the cable will immediately
restore the network.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="80"><h3>The Problem</h3></A>
<p>Use what you have just read to troubleshoot the scenario that follows.</p>

<p>A small company with three departments recently began networking and has installed
peer-to-peer networks in each department. The peer-to-peer networks are not connected to each
other. A user in one department must make a diskette of the information to be loaded on the
next network. Four employees in one department are working on a project. Each person has a
different set of responsibilities, and each produces documentation for a different part of the
project. Employees have each made the hard drive on their own computers available to everyone
else on the project.</p>

<p>As the project grows, each user produces more documents, and questions arise about who has
which document and which employee last revised a given document. Also, employees outside the
department who have an interest in the project are asking to see some of the completed
material.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Why are problems arising concerning who has which document? Suggest at least one reason.</li></p>

<p><li>What one change could you make that would give you centralized control of the access to these documents?</li></p>

<p><li>Describe one change that your solution will bring to the users' operating environment. </li></p>

<A NAME="81"><h2>Exercise 1.3: Network Planning Problem</h2></A>
<p>The following exercise will not only help you determine whether a peer-to-peer environment

become the most common kind of network used for new installations, primarily because networking
capabilities are now an integral part of most client-computer operating systems.

<A NAME="86"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The physical layout of computers on a network is called a topology.</li></p>

<p><li> There are four primary topologies: star, bus, ring, and mesh.</li></p>

<p><li> Topologies can be physical (actual wiring) or logical (the way they work).</li></p>

<p><li>In a bus topology, the computers are connected in a linear fashion on a single cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Bus topologies require a terminator on each end of the cable.</li></p>

<p><li> In a star topology, the computers are connected to a centralized hub.</li></p>

<p><li> Mesh topologies connect all computers in a network to one another with separate cables.</li></p>

<p><li> In a token-ring topology, the computers are connected physically in a star shape,
but logically in a ring or circle. The data is passed from one computer to another around the
circle.</li></p>

<p><li> Hubs are used to centralize the data traffic and localize failures. If one cable breaks, it will not shut down the entire network.</li></p>

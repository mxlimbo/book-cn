<h2>Lesson 1: Choosing a Network Design</h2>

<a name="ans33"><h3>Exercise  8.1: Creating a Peer-to-Peer Network/Part 1: Design a Topology</h3></a>

<p>Because peer-to-peer Ethernet can be implemented in the form of either a physical
bus or a physical star, you will need to look at these two different topologies in planning for
this network. On separate paper, draw:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>A logical bus with a physical bus.</li></p>

<p><li>A logical bus with a physical star.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><b>Though your drawings might not be as complex as these, you should have illustrated the following, at a minimum:</b></p>

<p><b>Physical bus&#8212;All computers should be connected individually to a point on
the bus. Each peripheral should be connected to the appropriate computer.</b></p>

<p><b>Physical star&#8212;Each computer should be connected to a central hub with an
individual cable. Each peripheral should be connected to the appropriate
computer, and there should be no terminators.</b></p>

<p><b>Figure 2</b> Sample network as a physical star

<p><b>While there is no one-size-fits-all correct form for this design, there are a few things you must take into consideration when you design the network. Check to see if you considered these factors.</b></p>

<p><b>For the logical bus with physical bus, did you:

<ul>
<p><li>Use thinnet coaxial cable to connect each computer in a series?
<p><li>Terminate both ends of the bus?
</ul>

<p>For the logical bus with physical star, did you:
<ul>
<p><li>Use CAT 5 UTP?
<p><li>Identify an appropriate location for the concentrator or hub?
</ul>
</b>



<a name="ans34"><h3>Exercise  8.1: Creating a Peer-to-Peer Network/Part 2: Select Your Materials</h3></a>

<p>Make a materials list for each of the topologies. Using the facility drawing
provided earlier in Figure 8.1, identify the location of each workstation and estimate all the
materials you will need to complete the job. Use the following table to help determine which
materials are required.</p>

<p><b>Material Requirements</b></p>
<p>

<tr>

<p><b>Once again, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to selecting materials for networking. What is
important is the process: thinking through the design and building the network on paper before
you begin to spend money and time on the installation. You should take into account
differences, such as cost, between the two types of network topology. For example, a small
thinnet physical bus design is less material-intensive than a physical star.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Establishing a Client/Server Environment</h2>

<a name="ans35"><h3>Exercise  8.2: Adding a Network Server</h3></a>

<p>In Exercise 8.1, we designed a peer-to-peer network and looked at two different
topologies. While these designs meet the immediate needs of our client, the custom bicycle
manufacturer, they are likely to fall short if the manufacturer decides to expand the business
in the future. In this exercise, you will be modifying the design you carried out in Exercise 1
to include a network server.</p>

<p>In planning your new design, consider the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Where should the server be located?</li></p>

<p><li> What additional materials are required?</li></p>

<p><li> What compatibility issues might arise?</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>From the standpoint of networking requirements, the server can be
placed in any location provided it is connected correctly to the media. Thus, while it is
necessary to locate the server where it can be accessed physically, it need not be centrally
located. The logical choice would be to place it in a room by itself. However, in our
client's office, no such room exists. The Accounting Department or the Product Design Group
offer two possible locations. The server will be more physically secure in the Accounting
Department office, where there is likely to be less traffic and where the door will probably be
locked when the office is unattended. The office of the Product Design Group is another
location in which the server could be somewhat isolated. The advantage of this site is that
staff members in this department, who are likely to be computer-literate, will be on hand and
can watch over the server's welfare.</b></p>

<p><b>When a network server is added to an existing peer-to-peer
network, at least one computer must be added to the existing number. With a small network, such
as that we are creating for our bicycle company, a single server can supply all the expected
resources, including files, printers, and applications. Making the physical connection is the
same as for a workstation: if the server computer is in the same location as the hub, simply
connect it with a patch cable. Otherwise connect the server with an available cable in one of
the vacant work areas.</b></p>

<p><b>Compatibility is another issue to consider. Each workstation needs
to communicate with the server. Depending on which network operating system is installed, some
of the computers on the network might need to be upgraded to meet the minimum requirements of
the server.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 3: Working with Device Drivers and NICs</h2>

<a name="ans36"><h3>Exercise  8.3: Connecting a New Computer</h3></a>

<p>What steps do you need to take in order to successfully connect the new computer to the
existing company network?</p>

<p><b>First, set up the computer and verify that it is in good working
order. If the operating system allows it, check for available interrupts in case this
information is needed when you configure the network interface card. Make a note of the
computer's installed RAM and disk capacity; these might be inadequate for network use or
for resource-intensive applications.</b></p>

<p><b>Once you have determined that the computer runs correctly and have
taken notes on its configuration, close any applications and shut down the operating system.
Disconnect all cables and open the CPU. Examine the main board for available bus slots, noting
the type of slot or slots available. If a PCI slot is available, it should be your preferred
choice; if not, an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slot might be available. (ISA is
discussed in <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media.&quot;)</b></p>

<p><b>Obtain a network interface card of the correct bus type&#8212;PCI
or ISA&#8212;and cable connector type&#8212;BNC or UTP&#8212;for the bicycle company's
existing network. Remember that if the existing network has 100Mhz UTP cabling, the card needs
to be capable of operating at that speed.</b></p>

<p><b>Compatible drivers normally accompany a network interface card.
These drivers are often loaded on floppy disks, but are sometimes placed on compact discs; if
the new computer does not have a CD reader installed, you might have to copy the drivers onto
floppy disks using a computer that has a CD reader installed.</b></p>

<p><b>Install the network interface card in the appropriate slot and
reconnect the computer cables. Also connect the network cable to the network interface
card's connection jack. Start the computer and install the latest drivers after the
computer is fully operational.</b></p>

<p><b>Before you can communicate with the network, you will have to
install the appropriate communication protocols. This software can normally be found on the
operating system's installation disks.</b></p>

<p><b>Test the completed installation by checking for network resources
in whichever way is appropriate for the network.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 4: Ensuring Hardware Compatibility</h2>

<a name="ans37"><h3>Exercise  8.4: Upgrading a Network</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Which resources do you anticipate are likely to present problems in the future
and, therefore, should be upgraded or replaced?</li></p>

<p><li>What do you suggest as the minimum operational requirements for equipment to be acquired
in the future?</li></p>

<p><b>The two Pentium computers should cause no problems, provided they have enough memory.
Suggest upgrading to at least 64 MB of RAM if they do not meet that requirement.</b></p>

<p><b>The two 486 machines can provide a few more years of service. Extra memory here might make
up for some lack of speed. You should also check closely to see what expansion slots are
available for these computers.</b></p>

<p><b>The 286 computer must go. You might want to move one of the 486 computers to the Shipping
Department and replace the computer in the Accounting Department.</b></p>

<p><b>All printers can be shared to the network, eliminating the requirement for the switch box.
Unless the current printers are overworked, they are probably worth keeping. You might consider
replacing the dot matrix printer, but not if the Shipping Department is printing forms. It is
not possible to print multisheet forms on laser or ink jet printers.</b></p>

<p><b>Future machines should at least meet the minimum requirements for Windows NT. Remember that
minimums aren't good enough. You should opt for at least 300 MHz and 64 MB of RAM. Also
check the number of expansion slots available to ensure that you can add the necessary
interface cards. Keep in mind that many lower-cost machines sacrifice expandability to keep the
price low.</b></p>

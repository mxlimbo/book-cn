<h2>Lesson 2: Managing a Shared Printer</h2>

<a name="ans47"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Identify and describe four tasks required for routine printer maintenance.</li></p>

<p><b>Printer maintenance includes supplying the printer with paper and toner, clearing the
printer if there is a paper jam, and monitoring the printer's output to ensure that print
jobs do not back up and overflow the printer's output bin. Other tasks are monitoring the
printer's performance and notifying a technician if a serious problem develops, as well as
routinely cleaning the printer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe how a network administrator can allocate a single printer's resources among
several workstations.</li></p>

<p><b>The best means of allocating a single printer's resources is to share the printer on a
network. Then give users network permission to use the shared printer.</b></p>

<p><li>Define PDLs and describe their function in printing.</li></p>

<p><b>PDLs are page-description languages that tell a printer how printed output should look. The
printer uses the PDL to construct text and graphics to create the page image.</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 3: Sharing Fax Modems</h2>

<a name="ans48"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>How does a fax server compare with a shared printer? What are the roles
of each?</li></p>

<p><b>A shared fax server does for fax communication what a shared printer does for printing: it
makes fax capabilities available to all users on the network. A shared fax server allows anyone
on the network to send a fax; a shared printer allows anyone on the network to access that
printer's resources.</b></p>

<p><li>Define the function of a fax server.</li></p>

<p><b>A fax server gives users the ability to send a fax without having to leave their desks.
Some fax servers allow an administrator to monitor incoming faxes and to route them to the
intended recipients, while discarding others, such as advertisements.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe three enhancements that can be added to a fax server.</li></p>

<p><b>Some fax-enhancement software allows users to send faxes from word-processing packages,
databases, spreadsheets, and e-mail. Some even provide diagnostic utilities, error reporting,
and accounting features to make fax servers easy to administer.</b></p>
</ol>

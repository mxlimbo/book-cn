<A NAME="487"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<p>In a peer-to-peer network we share, or make available to the network, any directories or
printers to which we want others to have access. In networks that have client/server
configurations, we use accounts to establish who can access which files, directories, and
printers. This chapter explores the differences between shares and accounts and demonstrates
how to use each appropriately. The focus in this chapter is on sharing and account procedures.
Using these features to secure the network from harm, intentional or accidental, is covered
in <A HREF="ch10a.htm#528">Chapter 10</A>, &quot;Ensuring Network Security.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="488"><h2>Before You Begin</h2></A>
<p>The concepts presented in this chapter are all new. Because the subject matter is complex,
you should be familiar with the network terms presented in previous chapters.</p>

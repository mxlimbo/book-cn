<h1>Networking Fundamentals</h1>

<p>In Part I, we introduce the basic concepts and principles that underlie computer networking, from the simplest peer-to-peer local area networks to the vastly complex wide area networks that reach across international boundaries and around the world. We present an overview of networking terminology, examine different network topologies and architectures, and focus on the physical components of computer networks, including server and client computers, and cabling and connectors. We also investigate what occurs within computers when they are linked and how they send and receive messages, including the standards and protocols that govern network communication. Part I concludes with an examination of network connectivity beginning with old-fashioned analog telephone lines and extending to the newest forms of digital and remote-access communication.</p>

<A NAME="524"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="525"><h3>Creating Network Shares</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> When files are transferred using a direct cable connection, one computer is
configured as a host and the other as a client. The client can then access files and
directories on the host computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Client software must be enabled before a computer can access any resources shared on a network.</li></p>

<p><li>The most common client used in a Windows environment is Client for Microsoft Networks.</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft Network client software enables users to share resources with any network that uses the SMB (Server Message Block) file-sharing protocol.</li></p>

<p><li>Before a computer can act as a server and share resources to a network, it must have the client software enabled and then have File and Print Sharing enabled.</li></p>

<p><li> Devices such as scanners and modems cannot be shared on a peer-to-peer network.</li></p>

<p><li> AppleShare provides folder-level sharing on Macintosh machines.</li></p>

<p><li>Linux file systems can be accessed by computers using AppleTalk and by computers using the SMB file sharing protocol.</li></p>

<p><li>The maximum number of connections that can be set for Windows NT Workstation is 10.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="526"><h3>Establishing and Managing Network Accounts</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Using a server-based network provides additional security by assigning each user an account with the appropriate rights and permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>User accounts are composed of a user name, logon password, and any logon parameters established for that user.</li></p>

<p><li>User accounts can be created or changed only by someone with administrative rights.</li></p>

<p><li>An administrator can use profiles to configure and maintain a user's logon environment.</li></p>

<p><li>Profiles include printer connections, regional settings, sound settings, mouse settings, display settings, and any other user-definable settings.</li></p>

<p><li> In networks with large numbers of users, it is simplest for an administrator
to create groups and assign users to groups. Because users receive the rights and permissions
of the group rather than as individuals, the administrator is not required to create them on an
individual basis.</li></p>

<p><li>The four types of groups designated by Microsoft Windows NT are local groups, global groups, system groups, and built-in groups.</li></p>

<p><li> Built-in groups include administrators, operator groups, and others.</li></p>

<p><li>NetWare provides security and accounts through NDS (NetWare Directory Services).</li></p>

<p><li>In NetWare, all resources, including users, are objects. An administrator can assign rights and permission to objects.</li></p>
</ul>

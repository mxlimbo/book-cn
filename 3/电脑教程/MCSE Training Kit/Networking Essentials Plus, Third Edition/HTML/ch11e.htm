<A NAME="617"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="618"><h3>Network Printing</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>The redirector is used to direct the print job from the local computer's printer port out to the network.</li></p>

<p><li>A print spooler is software that intercepts a print job and sends it to a print queue.</li></p>

<p><li>A print queue is a buffer where the print job is held until the printer is ready for it.</li></p>

<p><li>A printer, like files and directories, must be shared to the network before any user can access it.</li></p>

<p><li>Most network operating systems have a utility to help administer the printing process.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="619"><h3>Managing a Network Printer</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Managing a network printer includes maintaining the printer and managing the users who access the printer.</li></p>

<p><li>Managing printer users is similar to managing any other resource on the network; each user must have the appropriate rights and permissions before using the printer.</li></p>

<p><li>Most NOSs offer utilities that allow a printer to be managed from remote computers.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="620"><h3>Sharing Fax Modems</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>A fax server can provide all users on a network with the capability of sending and receiving faxes.</li></p>

<p><li>With a centralized fax service, an administrator can monitor all incoming faxes and route them appropriately.</li></p>

<p><li>Several manufacturers offer software that can be used to enhance the operation of a fax server.</li></p>
</ul>

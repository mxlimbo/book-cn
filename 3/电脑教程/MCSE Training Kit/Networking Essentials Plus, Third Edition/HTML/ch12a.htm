<A NAME="623"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<p>The chapter begins with a discussion of how to document information about a running network.
We look at how, by carefully recording the performance of the network and its components, you
can develop a baseline to refer to when assessing problems. Next, following a summary of the
upgrading process, we discuss how to evaluate the need for a network upgrade. After examining
which components can be upgraded, we offer guidelines for confirming that the network upgrade
was successful. The chapter concludes with tips on how to move a network installation.</p>

<A NAME="624"><h2>Before You Begin</h2></A>
<p>A review of <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; is recommended. It can also help to
revisit the earlier chapters of <a href="P02.htm">Part II</a>, &quot;Implementing a Network,&quot; especially <A HREF="ch08a.htm#423">Chapter 8</A>, &quot;Designing and Installing a Network,&quot; which covers how to take a network
inventory.</p>

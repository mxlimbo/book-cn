<A NAME="562"><h1>Lesson 3: Avoiding Data Loss</h1></A>
<p>Thus far in this chapter, we have covered maintaining network hardware and data security and
keeping computer components safe from harm. However, making networks secure also includes

<A NAME="563"><h2>Data Protection</h2></A>
<p>A site disaster is defined as anything that causes you to lose your data. Many large
organizations have extensive disaster-recovery plans to maintain operations and rebuild after a
natural disaster such as an earthquake or a hurricane. Many, but not all, include a plan to
recover the network. However, a network can incur a disastrous failure from many more sources
than natural disasters. Disaster recovery for a network goes beyond the replacing of the
physical hardware; the data must be protected as well. The causes of a network disaster,
ranging from human acts to natural causes, include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Component failure.</li></p>

<p><li> Computer viruses.</li></p>

<p><li> Data deletion and corruption.</li></p>

<p><li> Fire caused by arson or electrical mishaps.</li></p>

<p><li> Natural disasters, such as lightning, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes.</li></p>

<p><li> Power-supply failure and power surges.</li></p>

<p><li> Theft and vandalism.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a site disaster, the downtime spent recovering data from backup storage (if
you have backups) could result in a serious loss of productivity. And without backups, the
consequences are even more severe, possibly resulting in significant financial losses. There
are several ways to prevent or recover from data loss, including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Tape backup systems.</li></p>

<p><li> An uninterruptible power supply (UPS).</li></p>

<p><li> Fault-tolerant systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Optical drives and disks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Any or all of these approaches can be used, depending on how valuable the data is to the
organization and on the organization's budget constraints.</p>

<A NAME="564"><h2>Tape Backup</h2></A>
<p>The simplest, most inexpensive way to avoid disastrous loss of data is to implement a
schedule of periodic backups with storage offsite. Using a tape backup is still one of the few
simple and economical ways to ensure that data remains safe and usable.</p>

<p>Experienced network engineers advise that a backup system should be the first line of
defense against data loss. A secure backup strategy minimizes the risk of losing data by
maintaining a current backup&#8212;copies of existing files&#8212;so that files can be recovered
if harm comes to the original data. To back up data requires:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Appropriate equipment.</li></p>

<p><li> A regular schedule for periodic backups.</li></p>

<p><li> Ensuring that backup files are current.</li></p>

<p><li> Personnel assigned to make sure this schedule is carried out.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The equipment usually consists of one or more tape drives and tapes or other mass storage
media. Any expense incurred in this area is likely to be minimal compared to the value of what
will be saved in the event of data loss.</p>

<A NAME="565"><h3>Implementing a Backup System</h3></A>
<p>The rule is simple: if you cannot get along without it, back it up. Whether you back up
entire disks, selected directories, or files depends on how fast you will need to be
operational after losing important data. Complete backups make restoring disk configurations
much easier, but can require multiple tapes if there are large amounts of data. Backing up
individual files and directories might require fewer tapes, but could require the administrator
to manually restore disk configurations.</p>

<p>Critical data should be backed up according to daily, weekly, or monthly schedules,
depending on how critical the data is and how frequently it is updated. It is best to schedule
backup operations during periods of low system use. Users should be notified when the backup
will be performed so that they will not be using the servers during server backup.</p>

<p><b>Selecting a Tape Drive</b></p>

<p>Because the majority of backing up is done with tape drives, the first step is to select a
tape drive, weighing the importance of a variety of factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> How much data needs to be backed up.</li></p>

<p><li> The network's requirements for backup reliability, capacity, and speed.</li></p>

<p><li> The cost of the tape drive and related media.</li></p>

<p><li> The tape drive's compatibility with the operating system.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, a tape drive should have more than enough capacity to back up a network's
largest server. It should also provide error detection and correction during backup and restore
operations.</p>

<p><b>Backup Methods</b></p>

<p>As listed in Table 10.2, an efficient backup policy uses a combination of methods:</p>

<p><b>Table 10.2</b> <i>Backup Methods</i></p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Full backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up and marks selected files, whether or not they have 
 changed since the last backup.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Copy</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up all selected files without marking them as being 
 backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Incremental backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up and marks selected files only if they have changed 
 since the last time they were backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Daily copy</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up only those files that have been modified that day, 
 without marking them as being backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Differential backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up selected files only if they have changed since the 
 last time they were backed up, without marking them as being 
 backed up.</td>
</tr></table></p>

<p>Tapes can be backed up based on a multiple-week cycle, depending on how many tapes are
available. No rigid rules govern the length of the cycle. On the first day of the cycle, the
administrator performs a full backup and follows with an incremental backup on succeeding days.
When the entire cycle has finished, the process begins again. Another method is to schedule
streaming backups throughout the day.</p>

<A NAME="566"><h3>Testing and Storage</h3></A>
<p>Experienced administrators test the backup system before committing to it. They perform a
backup, delete the information, restore the data, and attempt to use the data.</p>

<p>The administrator should test the backup procedures regularly to verify that what is
expected to be backed up is actually being backed up. Additionally, the restore procedure
should be tested to ensure that important files can be restored quickly.</p>

<p>Ideally, an administrator should make two copies of each tape: one to be kept onsite, and
the other stored offsite in a safe place. Remember that although storing tapes in a fireproof
safe can keep them from actually burning, the heat from a fire will ruin the data stored on
them. After repeated usage, tapes lose the ability to store data. Replace tapes regularly to
ensure a good backup.</p>

<A NAME="567"><h3>Maintaining a Backup Log</h3></A>
<p>Maintaining a log of all backups is critical for later file recovery. A copy of the log
should be kept with the backup tapes, as well as at the computer site. The log should record
the following information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Date of backup</li></p>

<p><li> Tape-set number</li></p>

<p><li> Type of backup performed</li></p>

<p><li> Which computer was backed up</li></p>

<p><li> Which files were backed up</li></p>

<p><li> Who performed the backup</li></p>

<p><li> Location of the backup tapes</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="568"><h3>Installing the Backup System</h3></A>
<p>Tape drives can be connected to a server or a computer, and backups can be initiated from
the computer to which the tape drive is attached. If you run backups from a server, backup and
restore operations can occur very quickly because the data does not have to travel across the
network.</p>

<p>Backing up across the network is the most efficient way to back up multiple systems;
however, it creates a great deal of network traffic and slows the network down considerably.
Network traffic can also cause performance degradation. This is one reason why it is important
to perform backups during periods of low server use.</p>

<p>If multiple servers reside in one location, placing a backup computer on an isolated segment
can reduce backup traffic. As shown in Figure 10.8, the backup computer is then connected to a
separate NIC on each server.</p>

</p><p>

</p>


<A NAME="569"><h2>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</h2></A>
<p>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an automated external power supply designed to keep
a server or other device running in the event of a power failure. The UPS system takes
advantage of uninterruptible power supplies that can interface with an operating system such as
Microsoft Windows NT. The standard UPS provides a network with two crucial components:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A power source to run the server for a short time</li></p>

<p><li> A safe shutdown management service</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The power source is usually a battery, but the UPS can also be a gasoline engine running an
AC power supply.</p>

<p>If the power fails, users are notified of the failure and warned by the UPS to finish their
tasks. The UPS then waits a predetermined amount of time and performs an orderly system
shutdown.</p>

<p>A good UPS system will:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Prevent any more users from accessing the server.</li></p>

<p><li> Send an alert message to the network administrator through the server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>As shown in Figure 10.9, the UPS is usually located between the server and a power
source.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F10xx09.JPG" width=262 height=211 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.9</b> <i>Uninterruptible power supply as a backup power source</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>If power is restored while the UPS is active, the UPS will notify the users that the power
has returned.</p>

<A NAME="570"><h3>Types of UPS Systems</h3></A>
<p>The best UPS systems perform online. When the power source fails, the UPS batteries
automatically take over. The process is invisible to users.</p>

<p>There are also stand-by UPS systems that start when power fails. These are less expensive
than online systems, but are not as reliable.</p>

<A NAME="571"><h3>Implementing UPS</h3></A>
<p>Answering the following questions will help the network administrator determine which UPS
system best fits the needs of the network:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Will the UPS meet the basic power requirements of this network? How many components can it support?</li></p>

<p><li>Does the UPS communicate with the server to notify it when a power failure has occurred and the server is running on batteries?</li></p>

<p><li> Does the UPS feature surge protection to guard against power spikes and surges?</li></p>

<p><li>What is the life span of the UPS battery? How long can it be inactive before it starts to degrade?</li></p>

<p><li> Will the UPS warn the administrator and users that it is running out of power?</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="572"><h2>Fault-Tolerant Systems</h2></A>
<p>Fault-tolerant systems protect data by duplicating data or placing data in different
physical sources, such as different partitions or different disks. Data redundancy allows
access to data even if part of the data system fails. Redundancy is a prominent feature common
to most fault-tolerant systems.</p>

<p>Fault-tolerant systems should never be used as replacements for regular backup of servers
and local hard disks. A carefully planned backup strategy is the best insurance policy for
recovering lost or damaged data.</p>

<p>Fault-tolerant systems offer these alternatives for data redundancy:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Disk striping</li></p>

<p><li> Disk mirroring</li></p>

<p><li> Sector sparing</li></p>

<p><li> Mirrored drive arrays</li></p>

<p><li> Clustering</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="573"><h3>Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</h3></A>
<p>Fault-tolerance options are standardized and categorized into levels. These levels are known
as redundant array of independent disks (RAID), formerly known as redundant array of
inexpensive disks. The levels offer various combinations of performance, reliability, and
cost.</p>

<p><b>Level 0&#8212;Disk Striping</b></p>

<p>Disk striping divides data into 64K blocks and spreads it equally in a fixed rate and order
among all disks in an array. However, disk striping does not provide any fault tolerance
because there is no data redundancy. If any partition in the disk array fails, all data is
lost.</p>

<p>A stripe set combines multiple areas of unformatted free space into one large logical drive,
distributing data storage across all drives simultaneously. In Windows NT, a stripe set
requires at least two physical drives and can use up to 32 physical drives. Stripe sets can
combine areas on different types of drives, such as small computer system interface (SCSI),
enhanced small device interface (ESDI), and integrated device electronics (IDE) drives.</p>

<p>Figure 10.10 shows three hard disks being used to create a stripe set. In this case, the
data consists of 192 K of data. The first 64 K of data is written to a stripe on disk 1, the
second 64 K is written to a stripe on disk 2, and the third 64 K is written to the stripe on
disk 3.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F10xx10x.htm')"> <img src="images/F10xx10.JPG" width=404 height=243 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.10</b> <i>Disk striping combines areas on multiple drives</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Disk striping has several advantages: it makes one large partition out of several small
partitions, which offers better use of disk space; and multiple disk controllers will result in
better performance.</p>

<p><b>Level 1&#8212;Disk Mirroring</b></p>

<p>Disk mirroring actually duplicates a partition and moves the duplication onto another
physical disk. There are always two copies of the data, with each copy on a separate disk. Any
partition can be mirrored. This strategy is the simplest way to protect a single disk against
failure. Disk mirroring can be considered a form of continual backup because it maintains a
fully redundant copy of a partition on another disk.</p>

<p><b>Duplexing</b> Disk duplexing, as shown in Figure 10.11, consists of a mirrored pair of
disks with an additional disk controller on the second drive. This reduces channel traffic and
potentially improves performance. Duplexing is intended to protect against disk controller
failures as well as media failures.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.11</b> <i>Disk mirroring duplicates a partition on another physical disk</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Level 2&#8212;Disk Striping with ECC</b></p>

<p>When a block of data is written, the block is broken up and distributed (interleaved) across
all data drives. Error-correction code (ECC) requires a larger amount of disk space than
parity-checking methods, discussed under Level 3. Although this method offers marginal
improvement in disk utilization, it compares poorly with level 5, discussed later.</p>

<p><b>Level 3&#8212;ECC Stored As Parity</b></p>

<p>Disk striping with ECC stored as parity is similar to level 2. The term <i>parity</i> refers
to an error-checking procedure in which the number of 1s must always be the same&#8212;either
odd or even&#8212;for each group of bits transmitted without error. In this strategy, the ECC
method is replaced with a parity-checking scheme that requires only one disk to store parity
data.</p>

<p><b>Level 4&#8212;Disk Striping with Large Blocks</b></p>

<p>This strategy moves away from data interleaving by writing complete blocks of data to each
disk in the array. The process is still known as disk striping, but is done with large
blocks<i>.</i> A separate check disk is used to store parity information. Each time a write
operation occurs, the associated parity information must be read from the check disk and
modified. Because of this overhead, the block-interleaving method works better for large block
operations than for transaction-based processing.</p>

<p><b>Level 5&#8212;Striping with Parity</b></p>

<p>Striping with parity is currently the most popular approach to fault-tolerant design. It
supports from a minimum of three to a maximum of 32 drives and writes the parity information
across all the disks in the array (the entire stripe set). The data and parity information are
arranged so that the two are always on different disks.</p>

<p>A parity stripe block exists for each stripe (row) across the disk. The parity stripe block
is used to reconstruct data for a failed physical disk. If a single drive fails, enough
information is spread across the remaining disks to allow the data to be completely
reconstructed.</p>

<p>The parity stripe block is used to reconstruct data for a failed physical disk. A parity
stripe block exists for each stripe (row) across the disk. RAID 4 stores the parity stripe
block on one physical disk, and RAID 5 distributes parity evenly across all disks.</p>

<p><b>Level 10&#8212;Mirrored Drive Arrays</b></p>

<p>RAID level 10 mirrors data across two identical RAID 0 drive arrays.</p>

<A NAME="574"><h3>Sector Sparing</h3></A>
<p>The Windows NT Server operating system offers an additional fault-tolerant feature called
&quot;sector sparing,&quot; also known as &quot;hot fixing.&quot; The three steps of sector
sparing are shown in Figure 10.12. This feature automatically adds sector-recovery capabilities
to the file system while the computer is running.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F10xx13.JPG" width=373 height=132 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.12</b> <i>Sector sparing or hot-fixing steps</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>If bad sectors are found during disk I/O (input/output), the fault-tolerant driver will
attempt to move the data to a good sector and map out the bad sector. If the mapping is
successful, the file system is not alerted. It is possible for SCSI devices to perform sector
sparing, but ESDI and IDE devices cannot. Some network operating systems, such as Windows NT
Server, have a utility that notifies the administrator of all sector failures and of the
potential for data loss if the redundant copy also fails.</p>

<A NAME="575"><h3>Microsoft Clustering</h3></A>
<p>Microsoft Clustering is Microsoft's implementation of server clustering. The term
&quot;clustering&quot; refers to a group of independent systems that work together as a single
system. Fault tolerance is built into the clustering technology. Should a system within the
cluster fail, the cluster software will disperse the work from the failed system to the
remaining systems in the cluster. Clustering is not intended to replace current implementations
of fault-tolerant systems, although it does provide an excellent enhancement.</p>

<A NAME="576"><h3>Implementing Fault Tolerance</h3></A>
<p>Most advanced network operating systems offer a utility for implementing fault tolerance. In
Windows NT Server, for example, the Disk Administrator program is used to configure Windows NT
Server fault tolerance. The graphical interface of Disk Administrator makes it easy to
configure and manage disk partitioning and fault tolerant options. If you move the disk to a
different controller or change its ID, Windows NT will still recognize it as the original disk.
Disk Administrator is used to create various disk configurations, including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Stripe sets with parity, which accumulate multiple disk areas into one large
partition, distributing data storage across all drives simultaneously, adding fault tolerant
parity information.</li></p>

<p><li>Mirror sets, which make a duplicate of one partition and place it onto a separate physical disk.</li></p>

<p><li>Volume sets, which accumulate multiple disk areas into one large partition, filling the areas in sequence.</li></p>

<p><li>Stripe sets, which accumulate multiple disk areas into one large partition, distributing data storage across all drives simultaneously.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="577"><h2>Optical Drives and Disks</h2></A>
<p>The term &quot;optical drive&quot; is a generic term that is applied to several devices. In
optical technology, data is stored on a rigid disk by altering the disk's surface with a
laser beam.</p>

<p>The use of optical drives and discs is becoming increasingly popular. As the technology
evolves from the original read-only and read-write CD-ROMs to the new DVD technologies, these
devices are being used more and more to store large amounts of retrievable data. Optical-drive
manufacturers provide a large array of storage configurations that are either network-ready or
can be used with a network server. They are an excellent choice for permanent backup. Several
variations of this technology exist.</p>

<A NAME="578"><h3>CD-ROM Technology</h3></A>
<p>Compact discs (CD-ROMs) are the most common form of optical data storage. CD-ROMs, for the
most part, only allow information to be read. The advantages of using CDs for storage are many.
The ISO 9660 specification defines an international format standard for CD-ROM. Their storage
capacity is high&#8212;up to 650 MB of data on a 4.72-inch disc. They are portable and
replaceable, and because data on a CD-ROM cannot be changed (it is read-only), files cannot be
accidentally erased. Standard recording formats and inexpensive readers make CDs ideal for data
storage. CD-ROMs are also available in a multisession format called &quot;CD-recordable&quot; (CD-R). This media can now be used for incremental updates and inexpensive duplication. CD-ROMs
are also offered in a rewritable format called CD-rewritable.</p>

<A NAME="579"><h3>Digital Video Disc (DVD) Technology</h3></A>
<p>The digital video disc (DVD) family of formats is replacing the CD-ROM family of formats.
Digital video disc technology, also known as &quot;digital versatile disc,&quot; is newer and,
hence, relatively immature. DVD has five formats: DVD-ROM, DVD-Video, DVD-Audio, DVD-R (the
&quot;R&quot; stands for &quot;recordable&quot;), and DVD-RAM. DVD-R is the format for
write-once (incremental updates). It specifies 3.95 GB for single-sided discs and 7.9 GB for
double-sided discs. DVD-RAM is the format for rewritable discs. It specifies 2.6 GB for
single-sided discs and 5.2 GB for double-sided discs, with a disc cartridge as an option.
DVD-ROMs (read-only discs) are similar to CD-ROMs and have a storage capacity of 4.7 GB
(single-sided, single-layer), 9.4 GB (double-sided, single-layer), 8.5 GB (double-layer,
single-sided), 17 GB (dual-layer, double-sided). These are backward-compatible with CD-audio and CD-ROM. DVD-ROM drives can play DVD-R and all the DVD formats. UDF
is the file system for DVD-R.</p>

<A NAME="580"><h3>WORM (Write Once, Read Many) Technology</h3></A>
<p>Write once, read many (WORM) technology has helped initiate the document-imaging revolution.
WORM uses laser technology to permanently alter sectors of the disc, thereby permanently
writing files onto the media. Since this alteration is permanent, the device can write only
once to each disc. WORM is typically employed in imaging systems in which the images are static
and permanent.</p>

<A NAME="581"><h3>Rewritable Optical Technology</h3></A>
<p>Two new technologies are being employed that utilize rewritable optical technology. These
technologies include magneto-optical (MO) and phase change rewritable (PCR) discs. MO drives
are more widely accepted because the media and drive manufacturers use the same standards and
their products are cross-compatible. PCR devices, however, come from one manufacturer
(Matsushita/Panasonic), and the media comes from two manufacturers (Panasonic and Plasmon).</p>

<A NAME="582"><h3>Multifunction Drives</h3></A>
<p>There are two versions of multifunction optical drives. One uses firmware in the drive that
first determines whether a disc has been formatted for write-once or rewritable recording and
then acts on that disc accordingly. In the other MO version, two entirely different media are
used. The rewritable discs are conventional MO discs, but write-once media are traditional WORM
media.</p>

<A NAME="583"><h2>Disaster Recovery</h2></A>
<p>Trying to recover from a disaster, regardless of how it was caused, can be a terrifying
experience. How successful the recovery is depends on the extent to which the network
administrator has implemented disaster prevention and preparedness.</p>

<A NAME="584"><h3>Disaster Prevention</h3></A>
<p>The best way to recover from a disaster is to prevent it from happening in the first place.
When implementing disaster prevention:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Focus on factors over which you have control.</li></p>

<p><li> Determine the best method of prevention.</li></p>

<p><li> Implement and enforce the preventive measures you select.</li></p>

<p><li> Check continually for new and better methods of prevention.</li></p>

<p><li>Perform regular and routine maintenance on all network hardware and software components.</li></p>

<p><li>Remember that training is the key to preventing network disasters of the human kind.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="585"><h3>Disaster Preparation</h3></A>
<p>Not all disasters can be prevented. Every jurisdiction has a disaster-preparedness plan, and
many hours are spent every year in practicing for such an event. Because each community is
different, recovery plans will have to take different factors into account. If, for example,
you live in a flood zone, you should have a plan to protect your network from high water.</p>

<p>When considering disaster protection, you will need a plan for hardware, software, and data.
Hardware and software applications and operating systems can be replaced. But to do this,
it's necessary first to know exactly what assets you have. Take inventory of all hardware
and software, including date of purchase, model, and serial number. (For tips on how to make
such an inventory, refer to Chapter 8, <a href="ch08b.htm#426">Lesson 1: Choosing a Network Design</a>.)</p>

<p>Physical components of a network can be easily replaced and are usually covered by some form
of insurance, but data is highly vulnerable to disaster. In the case of a fire, you can replace
all the computers and hardware, but not the files, drawings, and specifications for the
multimillion dollar project that your organization has been preparing for the last year.</p>

<p>The only protection from a data-loss disaster is to implement one or more of the methods
described earlier to back up data. Store your backups in a secure place, such as a bank safe
deposit box, away from the network site.</p>

<p>To fully recover from any disaster you will need to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Make a disaster-recovery plan.</li></p>

<p><li> Implement the plan.</li></p>

<p><li> Test the plan.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="586"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson.</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Planning for a disaster is an essential part of implementing a successful network.</li></p>

<p><li> A network disaster plan should encompass the loss of hardware and data.</li></p>

<p><li> Tape backup is the most common method of preventing data loss.</li></p>

<p><li>Loss of electrical power can causes files to become corrupted, and any data being held in RAM to be lost.</li></p>

<p><li>An uninterruptible power supply provides temporary power so that critical data can be properly stored before the network or computer goes down.</li></p>

<p><li> Fault tolerance is the automatic duplication of data to prevent loss.</li></p>

<p><li>Fault tolerant strategies are called redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) and include disk striping and disk mirroring.</li></p>

<p><li> Sector sparing is an advanced method of fault tolerance.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="587"><h2>Exercise 10.1: Case Study Problem</h2></A>
<p>A small organization recently suffered security breaches in its peer-to-peer network. The
intruder stole valuable business data. The organization's need for security became
apparent, and now a modest-sized, but more secure, 
server-based network is in place.</p>

<p>The organization is located in a small California community that experiences frequent
earthquakes and power outages. Your job is to plan how to avoid breaches of security and plan
for disaster recovery at the same time. In this exercise, examine preventive measures the
organization can take to avoid data loss due to human activities and natural disasters such as
earthquakes.</p>

<p>List the categories of things that can put the organization's data at risk. Discuss the
preventive measures and recovery plans appropriate for each kind of data loss.</p>

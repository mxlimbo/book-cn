<A NAME="132"><h1>Lesson 3: Wireless Networking</h1></A>
<p>This lesson presents an overview of wireless-network technology. You are introduced to the
characteristics of the various wireless environments as well as the major wireless transmission
and reception components.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Identify the three types of wireless networks and the uses of each.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the four transmission techniques used in local area networking.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the three types of signal transmission used in mobile computing.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b> </p>

</p>

<A NAME="133"><h2>The Wireless Environment</h2></A>
<p>The wireless environment is an often appropriate, and sometimes necessary, networking
option. Today, manufacturers are offering more products at attractive prices that, in turn,
will mean increased sales and demand in the future. As demand increases, the wireless
environment will grow and improve.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;wireless environment&quot; is misleading because it implies a network
completely free of cabling. In most cases, this is not true. Most wireless networks actually
consist of wireless components communicating with a network that uses the cabling discussed
earlier in this chapter in a mixed-component network called a <i>hybrid network</i>.</p>

<A NAME="134"><h3>Wireless Network Capabilities</h3></A>
<p>Wireless networks are attracting attention because wireless components can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Provide temporary connections to an existing, cabled network.</li></p>

<p><li> Help provide backup to an existing network.</li></p>

<p><li> Provide some degree of portability.</li></p>

<p><li> Extend networks beyond the limits of physical connectivity.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="135"><h3>Uses for Wireless-Network Connectivity</h3></A>
<p>The inherent difficulty of setting up cable networks is a factor that will continue to push
wireless environments toward greater acceptance. Wireless connectivity can be especially useful
for networking:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Busy locations, such as lobbies and reception areas.</li></p>

<p><li> Users who are constantly on the move, such as doctors and nurses in hospitals.</li></p>

<p><li> Isolated areas and buildings.</li></p>

<p><li> Departments in which the physical setting changes frequently and unpredictably.</li></p>

<p><li> Structures, such as historic buildings, for which cabling presents challenges.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="136"><h2>Types of Wireless Networks</h2></A>
<p>Wireless networks can be divided into three categories based on their technology:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> LANs</li></p>

<p><li> Extended LANs</li></p>

<p><li> Mobile computing</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The primary difference between these categories lies in the transmission facilities.
Wireless LANs and extended LANs use transmitters and receivers owned by the company in which
the network operates. Mobile computing uses public carriers, such as long distance telephone
companies, along with local telephone companies and their public services, to transmit and
receive signals.</p>

<A NAME="137"><h3>LANs</h3></A>
<p>Except for the media used, a typical wireless network operates almost like a cabled network:
a wireless network interface card with a transceiver is installed in each computer, and users
communicate with the network just as if they were using cabled computers.</p>

<p><b>Access Points</b></p>

<p>The transceiver, sometimes called an access point, broadcasts and receives signals to and
from the surrounding computers and passes data back and forth between the wireless computers
and the cabled network.</p>

<p>These wireless LANs use small wall-mounted transceivers to connect to the wired network.
Figure 2.32 shows a wireless connection between a laptop computer and a LAN. The transceivers
establish radio contact with portable networked devices. Note that this is not a true wireless
LAN, because it uses a wall-mounted transceiver to connect to a standard, cabled LAN.</p>

</p>


<p><b>Transmission Techniques</b></p>

<p>Wireless LANs use four techniques for transmitting data:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Infrared transmission</li></p>

<p><li> Laser transmission</li></p>

<p><li> Narrowband (single-frequency) radio transmission</li></p>

<p><li> Spread-spectrum radio transmission</li></p>
</ol>

<p><b>Infrared Transmission</b> All infrared wireless networks operate by using an infrared
light beam to carry the data between devices. These systems need to generate very strong
signals because weak transmission signals are susceptible to interference from light sources
such as windows. Many of the high-end printers sold today are preconfigured to accept infrared
signals. Figure 2.33 shows a laptop computer using an infrared light beam to send data to a
printer.</p>

<p>This method can transmit signals at high rates because of infrared light's high
bandwidth. An infrared network can normally broadcast at 10 Mbps.</p>

<p>There are four types of infrared networks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Line-of-sight networks</b> As the name implies, this version of infrared
networking transmits only if the transmitter and receiver have a clear line of sight between
them.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Scatter infrared networks</b> In this technology, broadcast transmissions
are bounced off walls and ceilings and eventually hit the receiver. They are effective within
an area limited to about 30.5 meters (100 feet).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Reflective networks</b> Optical transceivers situated near the computers transmit to a common location that redirects the transmissions to the appropriate computer.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Broadband optical telepoint</b> This infrared wireless LAN provides broadband
services and is capable of handling high-quality multimedia requirements that can match those
provided by a cabled network.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<img src="images/F02xx33.JPG" width=344 height=238 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.33</b> <i>Wireless portable computer using an infrared light beam to send data to a printer</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>While its speed and convenience are generating interest, infrared has difficulty
transmitting for distances greater than 30.5 meters (100 feet). It is also subject to
interference from the strong ambient light found in most business environments.</p>

<p><b>Laser Transmission</b> Laser technology is similar to infrared technology in that it
requires a direct line of sight, and any person or thing that breaks the laser beam will block
the transmission.</p>

<p><b>Narrowband (Single-Frequency) Radio Transmission</b> This approach is similar to
broadcasting from a radio station. The user tunes both the transmitter and the receiver to a
certain frequency. This does not require line-of-sight focusing because the broadcast range is
3000 meters (9842 feet). However, because the signal is high frequency, it is subject to
attenuation from steel and load-bearing walls.</p>

<p>Narrowband radio is a subscription service. The service provider handles all the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) licensing requirements. This method is relatively slow;
transmission is in the 4.8 Mbps range.</p>

<p><b>Spread-Spectrum Radio Transmission</b> Spread-spectrum radio broadcasts signals over a
range of frequencies. This helps it avoid narrowband communication problems.</p>

<p>The available frequencies are divided into channels, known as <i>hops</i>, which are
comparable to one leg of a journey that includes intervening stops between the starting point
and the destination. The spread-spectrum adapters tune in to a specific hop for a predetermined
length of time, after which they switch to a different hop. A hopping sequence determines the
timing. The computers in the network are all synchronized to the hop timing. This type of
signaling provides some built-in security in that the frequency-hopping algorithm of the
network would have to be known in order to tap into the data stream.</p>

<p>To further enhance security and to keep unauthorized users from listening in to the
broadcast, the sender and the receiver can encrypt the transmission.</p>

<p>Spread-spectrum radio technology provides for a truly wireless network. For 
example, two or more computers equipped with spread-spectrum network adapters and an operating
system with built-in networking capability can act as a peer-to-peer network with no connecting
cables. In addition, such a wireless network can be tied into an existing network by adding an
appropriate interface to one of the computers on that network.</p>

<p>Although some implementations of spread-spectrum radio can offer transmission speeds of 4
Mbps over distances of about 3.22 kilometers (two miles) outdoors and 244 meters (800 feet)
indoors, the typical speed of 250 Kbps (kilobits per second) makes this method much slower than
the other wireless networking options discussed.</p>

<p><b>Point-to-Point Transmission</b></p>

<p>The <i>point-to-point</i> method of data communication does not fall neatly into the present
definitions of networking. It uses a point-to-point technology that transfers data from one
computer to another instead of communicating among several computers and peripherals. However,
additional components such as single and host transceivers are available. These can be
implemented in either stand-alone computers or computers already on a network to form a
wireless data-transfer network.</p>

<p>This technology involves wireless serial data transfer that:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Uses a point-to-point radio link for fast, error-free data transmission.</li></p>

<p><li> Penetrates through walls, ceilings, and floors.</li></p>

<p><li>Supports data rates from 1.2 to 38.4 Kbps up to 61 meters (200 feet) indoors or about 0.5 kilometers (0.30 miles) with line-of-sight transmission.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>This type of system transfers data between computers, or between computers and other devices
such as printers or bar-code readers.</p>

<A NAME="138"><h3>Extended LANs</h3></A>
<p>Other types of wireless components are able to function in the extended LAN environment
similarly to their cabled counterparts. A wireless LAN bridge, for example, can connect
networks up to 4.8 kilometers (three miles) apart.</p>

<p><b>Multipoint Wireless Connectivity</b></p>

<p>A <i>wireless bridge</i> is a component that offers an easy way to link buildings without
using cable. In the same way that a footbridge provides a path between two points, a wireless
bridge provides a data path between two buildings. Figure 2.34 shows a wireless bridge
connecting two LANs. The AIRLAN/Bridge Plus, for example, uses spread-spectrum radio technology
to create a wireless backbone to tie locations together over distances beyond the reach of
LANs. With variations that depend on atmospheric and geographic conditions, this distance can
be up to 4.8 kilometers (three miles).</p>

<p>Though costly, such a component might be justified because it eliminates the expense of
leased lines.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02xx34x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02xx34.JPG" width=404 height=173 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.34</b> <i>Wireless bridge connecting two LANs</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>The Long-Range Wireless Bridge</b></p>

<p>If the wireless bridge will not reach far enough, another alternative to consider is a
long-range wireless bridge. These also use spread-spectrum radio technology to provide both
Ethernet and Token Ring bridging, but for a distance of up to 40 kilometers (about 25
miles).</p>

<p>As with the original wireless bridge, the cost of the long-range bridge might be justified
because it eliminates the need for T1 line or microwave connections.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A <i>T1 line</i> is a high-speed communications line that can handle
digital communications and Internet access at the rate of 1.544 Mbps.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="139"><h3>Mobile Computing</h3></A>
<p>Wireless mobile networks use telephone carriers and public services to transmit and receive
signals using:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Packet-radio communication.</li></p>

<p><li> Cellular networks.</li></p>

<p><li> Satellite stations.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Traveling employees can use this technology with portable computers or personal digital
assistants (PDAs) to exchange e-mail messages, files, or other information.</p>

<p>While this form of communication offers convenience, it is slow. Transmission rates range
from 8 Kbps to 19.2 Kbps. The rates slow further when error correction is included.</p>

<p>Mobile computing incorporates wireless adapters that use cellular-telephone technology to
connect portable computers with the cabled network. Portable computers use small antennas to
communicate with radio towers in the surrounding area. Satellites in near-earth orbit pick up
low-powered signals from portable and mobile networked devices.</p>

<p><b>Packet-Radio Communication</b></p>

<p>This system breaks a transmission into packets.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A <i>packet</i> is a unit of information transmitted as a whole from one
device to another on a network. Packets are discussed in greater detail in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a>,
&quot;Understanding Network Architecture.&quot;
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>These radio packets are similar to other network packets. They include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The source address.</li></p>

<p><li> The destination address.</li></p>

<p><li> Error-correction information.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The packets are linked up to a satellite that broadcasts them. Only devices with the correct
address can receive the broadcast packets.</p>

<p><b>Cellular Networks</b></p>

<p><i>Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)</i> uses the same technology and some of the same
systems that cellular telephones use. It offers computer data transmissions over existing
analog voice networks between voice calls when the system is not busy. This is very fast
technology that suffers only subsecond delays, making it reliable enough for real-time
transmission.</p>

<p>As in other wireless networks, there must be a way to tie the cellular network in to the
existing cabled network. An Ethernet interface unit (EIU) can provide this connection.</p>

<p><b>Satellite Stations</b></p>

<p>Microwave systems are a good choice for interconnecting buildings in small, short-distance
systems such as those on a campus or in an industrial park.</p>

<p>Microwave transmission is currently the most widely used long-distance transmission method
in the United States. It is excellent for communicating between two line-of-sight points such
as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Satellite-to-ground links.</li></p>

<p><li> Between two buildings.</li></p>

<p><li> Across large, flat, open areas, such as bodies of water or deserts.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A microwave system consists of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Two radio transceivers: one to generate (transmitting station) and one to receive (receiving station) the broadcast.</li></p>

<p><li> Two directional antennas pointed at each other to implement communication of the
signals broadcast by the transceivers. These antennas are often installed on towers to give
them more range and to raise them above anything that might block their signals.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="140"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The wireless environment is an often appropriate, and sometimes necessary, networking option.</li></p>

<p><li> Computers operating on a wireless network function like their wire-bound
counterparts, except that the network interface card is connected to a transceiver instead of a
cable.</li></p>

<p><li>A wireless segment can be either point-to-point (separated by short distances or in view of each other) or long-range.</li></p>

<p><li>Wireless networks use infrared, laser, narrowband radio, or spread-spectrum radio signals for transmitting data.</li></p>

<p><li>A wireless bridge can connect buildings that are situated as much as 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) apart.</li></p>

<p><li>Cellular communication, satellite stations, and packet-radio communications are adding mobility to networks.</li></p>

<A NAME="141"><h2>Exercise 2.3: Network Planning Problem</h2></A>
<p>This exercise provides you with the experience of planning for two aspects of a network
(selecting the right media and selecting the right NIC).</p>

<A NAME="142"><h3>Part 1: Choosing Your Networking Media</h3></A>
<p>Research has shown that about 90 percent of all new network installations are using UTP
cable in a star-bus topology. Because most of the cost of cable installation is applied to
labor, there is often little cost difference between using Category 3 UTP cable and Category 5
UTP cable. Most new installations use Category 5 because it supports transmission speeds of up
to 100 Mbps. Category 5 allows you to install a 10 Mbps solution now and upgrade it to a 100
Mbps solution later. However, UTP cable might not be suitable for all networking
situations.</p>

<p>The following questions prompt you to think about your network cable needs. Place a check
mark next to the choice that applies to your site. To determine which type of cabling would be
most appropriate for your site, simply total the check marks next to each type of cable
indicator (UTP, coaxial, STP, fiber-optic). The indicator with the highest number of check
marks is the candidate unless there is a specific requirement for a particular cable type such
as fiber-optic (distance and security). In cases in which more than one type of cable is
indicated, choose UTP where possible.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
UTP is currently the most popular cabling option. Unless there is a
compelling reason to use another type, UTP should be the first choice you
consider.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>For the purpose of answering the questions that follow, &quot;Any&quot; means that UTP can

<A NAME="143"><h3>Part 2: Choosing Your Network Interface Card</h3></A>
<p>There are dozens of manufacturers making each type of NIC, and each card has slightly
different features. Setup is sometimes accomplished with jumpers or switches, sometimes using a
software setup program, sometimes by means of a Plug and Play (PnP) bus type, and so on. You
should do some research to determine which card is best for you because the industry is
constantly changing. The best card this month might be updated or superseded by another
manufacturer's card next month.</p>

<p>If you answer yes to each of the following questions, then the card you have chosen will
probably work in your environment.</p>

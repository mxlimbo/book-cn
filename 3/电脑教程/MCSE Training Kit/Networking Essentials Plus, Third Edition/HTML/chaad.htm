<h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Network Operating Systems</h2>

<a name="ans14"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>In a networking environment, ______________ provide resources to the network,
and client network software makes these resources available to the client computer.</li></p>

<p><b>servers</b></p>

<p><li>In __________________ multitasking, the operating system can take control of the

<p><b>gateway</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 3: Microsoft Network Operating Systems</h2>

<a name="ans16"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>In Windows NT networking, a ______________ is a collection of computers that
share a common database and security policy.</li></p>

<p><b>domain</b></p>

<p><li>Each Windows NT domain has one ______________ ______________ _________________.</li></p>

<p><b>primary domain controller</b></p>

<p><li>Windows NT can provide directory- and file-level sharing on an _______ disk partition,
but only directory-level sharing on a 16-bit _______ disk partition.</li></p>

<p><b>NTFS, FAT</b></p>

<p><li>To set sharing on a Windows NT computer you must have _______________ privileges.</li></p>

<p><b>administrator</b></p>

<p><li>NWLink is a network protocol that helps Windows NT and NetWare
____________________.</li></p>

<p><b>interoperate</b></p>

<p><li>On a Windows NT network, any client or server can function as a print
_______________.</li></p>

<p><b>server</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson4: Other Network Operating Systems</h2>

<a name="ans17"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>AppleTalk zones are _______________ ____________ of networks and network
resources.</li></p>

<p><b>logical groups</b></p>

<p><li>In a UNIX network, personal computers can be used as _________ terminals.</li></p>

<p><b>dumb</b></p>

<p><li>Banyan Vines can communicate with Windows NT using the ____________ protocol.</li></p>

<p><b>TCP/IP</b></p>

<p><li>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and 98, MacOS, and OS/2 Warp incorporate __________ -
______ - __________ network operating systems.</li></p>

<p><b>peer-to-peer</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 5: Network Operating Systems in Multivendor Environments</h2>

<a name="ans18"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>In a multivendor environment, it is necessary to find a ________________
_______________ in which all computers can communicate.</li></p>

<p><b>common language</b></p>

<p><li>A redirector will ______________ your request to the appropriate destination.</li></p>

<p><b>forward</b></p>

<p><li>Each redirector handles only the ______________ sent in the language or protocol that it
can understand.</li></p>

<p><b>packets</b></p>

<p><li>Apple computers are brought into a Windows NT environment by means of communication
______________ that are installed on the server.</li></p>

<p><b>services</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans19"><h3>Exercise  4.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>The owner wants everyone on this network to be able to exchange files, use both
printers, and have access to company e-mail through an Internet service provider. She has made
it clear that she does not want a network that requires high administrative overhead.</p>

<p><b>There might not be a completely satisfactory solution in this
situation, in which case it is important to satisfy the most important criteria. Because
the owner is unwilling to consider a network that requires significant administrative overhead,
a peer-to-peer network seems appropriate.</b></p>

<p><b>By enabling the peer-to-peer networking that resides in the
company's existing computers and by connecting the computers and resources with 100Mb UTP
cabling and TCP/IP, an adequate degree of interoperability is achieved. Using TCP/IP also
allows both printers to be connected to the network itself, using network port hardware, rather
than to individual computers.</b></p>

<p><b>Enabling sharing on all computers makes their resources available
to the others. Enabling Apple services on the Windows NT computer creates a path between the
graphic designer, who uses the Apple NOS, and the others, who use two of the Windows network
operating systems.</b></p>

<A NAME="324"><h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Protocols</h1></A>
<p>This lesson offers an introduction to protocols and their function in a networking
environment. It explains the roles of protocols in network communications and describes how
different protocols work at different OSI levels.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Identify the functions of protocols and protocol stacks.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the network processes that use protocols and how they utilize them.</li></p>

<p><li> Map specific protocols to the appropriate OSI level.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="325"><h2>The Function of Protocols</h2></A>
<p>Protocols are rules and procedures for communicating. The term &quot;protocol&quot; is used
in a variety of contexts. For example, diplomats from one country adhere torules of protocol
designed to help them interact smoothly with diplomats from맖ther countries. Rules of protocol
apply in the same way in the computer environment. When several computers are networked, the
rules and technical procedures governing their communication and interaction are called
protocols.</p>

<p>Keep three points in mind when you think about protocols in a network environment:</p>

<ul>
<P><li> There are many protocols. While each protocol facilitates basic communications, each
has different purposes and accomplishes different tasks. Each protocol has its own advantages
and restrictions.</li></p>

<p><li> Some protocols work only at particular OSI layers. The layer at which a protocol
works describes its function. For example, a protocol that works at the physical layer ensures
that the data packet passes through the network interface card (NIC) and out onto the network
cable.</li></P>

<P><li> Protocols can also work together in a protocol stack, or suite. Just as a network
incorporates functions at every layer of the OSI reference model, different protocols also work together
at different levels in a single protocol stack. The levels in the protocol stack
&quot;map,&quot; or correspond, to the layers of the OSI reference model. For instance, the TCP/IP
protocol's application layer maps to the OSI reference model's presentation layer. Taken
together, the protocols describe the entire stack's functions and capabilities.</li></P>
</ul>



<A NAME="326"><h3>How Protocols Work</h3></A>
<p>The entire technical operation by which data is transmitted over the network has to be
broken down into discrete, systematic steps. At each step, certain actions take place that
cannot take place at any other step. Each step includes its own rules and procedures, or
protocol.</p>

<p>The protocol steps must be carried out in a consistent order that is the same on만very
computer in the network. In the sending computer, these steps must be만xecuted from the top
down. In the receiving computer, these steps must be carried out from the bottom up.</p>

<p><b>The Sending Computer</b></p>

<p>Protocols at the sending computer:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Break the data into smaller sections, called packets, that the protocol can handle.</li></p>

<p><li>Add addressing information to the packets so that the destination computer on맚he network can determine that the data belongs to it.</li></p>

<p><li> Prepare the data for transmission through the NIC and out onto the network cable.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><b>The Receiving Computer</b></p>

<p>Protocols at the receiving computer carry out the same series of steps in reverse order.
They:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Take the data packets off the cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Bring the data packets into the computer through the NIC.</li></p>

<p><li>Strip the data packets of all the transmitting information that was added by the sending computer.</li></p>

<p><li> Copy the data from the packets to a buffer for reassembly.</li></p>

<p><li> Pass the reassembled data to the application in a usable form.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>Both sending and receiving computers need to perform each step in the same way so that the
data will have the same structure when it is received as it did when it was sent.</p>

<p>For example, two different protocols might each break data into packets and add on various
sequencing, timing, and error-checking information, but each will do it differently. Therefore,
a computer using one of these protocols will not be able to communicate successfully with a
computer that is using the other protocol.</p>

<A NAME="327"><h3>Routable Protocols</h3></A>
<p>Until the mid-1980s, most local area networks (LANs) were isolated. A LAN served a single
department or company and was rarely connected to any larger environments. As LAN technology
matured, however, and the data communication needs of businesses expanded, LANs evolved,
becoming components in larger data communication networks in which LANs talked to each
other.</p>

<p>Data that is sent from one LAN to another along any of several available paths is said to be
<i>routed</i>. The protocols that support multipath LAN-to-LAN communications are known as <i>
routable protocols</i>. Because routable protocols can be used to tie several LANs together and
create new wide-area environments, they are becoming increasingly important.</p>

<A NAME="328"><h2>Protocols in a Layered Architecture</h2></A>
<p>In a network, several protocols have to work together. By working together, they만nsure that
the data is properly prepared, transferred to the right destination, received, and acted
upon.</p>

<p>The work of the various protocols must be coordinated so that no conflicts or incomplete
operations take place. The results of this coordination effort are known as <i>
layering</i>.</p>

<A NAME="329"><h3>Protocol Stacks</h3></A>
<p>A protocol stack is a combination of protocols. Each layer of the stack specifies
a맋ifferent protocol for handling a function or subsystem of the communication process. Each
layer has its own set of rules. In <A HREF="ch05a.htm#285">Chapter 5</A>, &quot;Introducing Network Standards,&quot; we
discussed the OSI reference model. Figure 6.1 shows the OSI reference model and the rules associated with each
layer. The protocols define the rules for each layer in the OSI reference model.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.1</b> <i>The OSI reference model showing the layers of protocols</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The lower layers in the OSI reference model specify how manufacturers can make their equipment connect
to equipment from other manufacturers, for example, by using NICs from several manufacturers on
the same LAN. As long as they operate with맚he same protocols, they are able to send and
receive data from each other. The upper layers specify rules for conducting communications
sessions (the time during which two computers maintain a connection) and the interpretation of
applications. The higher they are in the stack, the more sophisticated the tasks and their
associated protocols become.</p>

<A NAME="330"><h3>The Binding Process</h3></A>
<p>The <i>binding process</i>&#8212;the process by which protocols become connected to each
other and the NIC&#8212;allows a great deal of flexibility in setting up a network. Protocols
and NICs can be mixed and matched on an as-needed basis. For example, two protocol stacks, such
as Internetwork Packet Exchange and Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX), discussed in Lesson 3:
NetWare Protocols, and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), discussed in
Lesson 2: TCP/IP, can be bound to one NIC. If there is more than one NIC in the computer, one
protocol stack can be bound to either or both NICs.</p>

<p>The binding order determines the sequence in which the operating system runs the protocol.
When multiple protocols are bound to a single NIC, the binding order is맚he sequence in which
the protocols will be utilized to attempt a successful connection. Typically, the binding
process is initiated when either the operating system or the protocol is installed or
initialized. For example, if TCP/IP is the first protocol to be bound, the network operating
system will attempt a network connection via TCP/IP before attempting to use another protocol.
If this network connection fails, the computer will attempt to make a connection by using the
next protocol in the binding order.</p>

<p>The binding process consists of more than just binding the protocol stack to the NIC.
Protocol stacks need to be bound or associated with the components above and below them so that
data can proceed smoothly through the stack during execution. For example, TCP/IP may be bound
to the Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) session layer above as well as to the NIC
driver below it. TheNIC driver is also bound to the NIC.</p>

<A NAME="331"><h3>Standard Stacks</h3></A>
<p>The computer industry has designated several kinds of stacks as standard protocol models.
Hardware and software manufacturers can develop their products to meet any one or a combination
of these protocols. The most important models include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The ISO/OSI protocol suite.</li></p>

<p><li> The IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA).</li></p>

<p><li> Digital DECnet.</li></p>

<p><li> Novell NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li> Apple's AppleTalk.</li></p>

<p><li> The Internet protocol suite, TCP/IP.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Protocols exist at each layer of these stacks, performing the tasks specified by that layer.
However, the communication tasks that networks need to perform are많rouped into one of three
protocol types. Each type is comprised of one or맔ore layers of the OSI. As shown in Figure
6.2, these three protocol types map roughly to layers of the OSI reference model (application, transport,
and network).</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Many protocols were written long before the OSI reference model came into common
use. Thus, it is not uncommon to find protocol stacks that do not map directly to the OSI
model.

addressing and routing information, error checking, and retransmission requests. Network
protocols also define rules for communicating in a particular networking environment such as
Ethernet or Token Ring. Popular network protocols are shown in Table 6.3.</p>

<A NAME="332"><h3>Protocol Standards</h3></A>
<p>The OSI reference model is used to define which protocols should be used at each layer. Figure 6.3
shows the OSI reference model and how several popular network manufacturers apply their protocols.
Products from different manufacturers that subscribe to this model can communicate with each
other.</p>

</p>


<p>The ISO, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), ANSI (American
National Standards Institute), CCITT (Comit&eacute; Consultatif Internationale de
T&eacute;l&eacute;graphie et T&eacute;l&eacute;phonie), now called the ITU (International
Telecommunications Union), and other standards bodies have developed protocols that map to some
of the layers in the OSI reference model.</p>

<p>The IEEE protocols at the physical layer are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>802.3 (Ethernet)</b> This is a logical bus network that can transmit data at
10Mbps. Data is transmitted on the network to every computer. Only computers meant to receive
the data acknowledge the transmission. The carrier-sense multiple access with collision
detection (CSMA/CD) protocol regulates network traffic by allowing a transmission only when the
network is clear and no other computer is transmitting.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>802.4 (token passing)</b> This is a bus layout that uses a token-passing scheme.
Each computer receives all the data, but only the computers that are addressed respond. A token
that travels the network determines which computer is able to broadcast.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>802.5 (Token Ring)</b> This is a logical ring network that transmits at either
4Mbps or 16 Mbps. Although this is called a ring, it more resembles a star with each computer
branching off a hub. The ring is actually inside the hub. A맚oken traveling around the ring
determines which computer can send data.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>As described in Chapter 5, <a href="ch05b.htm#288">Lesson 1: Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model</a>, the data-link
layer is divided into two sublayers (see Figure 6.4).</p>

<p>The IEEE has further defined these protocols to facilitate communications activity at the
Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F06xx04x.htm')"> <img src="images/F06xx04.JPG" width=404 height=135 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.4</b> <i>MAC driver or NIC driver</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>A MAC driver is located at the Media Access Control sublayer; this device driver is also
known as the NIC driver. It provides low-level access to network adapters by providing
data-transmission support and some basic adapter management functions.</p>

<p>A MAC protocol determines which computer can use the network cable when several computers
try to use it simultaneously. CSMA/CD, the 802.3 protocol, allows computers to transmit data
when no other computer is transmitting. If two hosts transmit simultaneously, a collision
occurs. The protocol detects the collision and halts all transmission until the wire is clear.
Then, each computer can begin to transmit again after waiting a random period of time.</p>

<A NAME="333"><h2>Implementing and Removing Protocols</h2></A>
<p>Protocols are implemented and removed in much the same way that drivers are added and
removed. Essential protocols are installed automatically at the same time the initial operating
system is installed on the computer. To install protocols such as NWLink after the initial
installation, the network operating system usually includes a utility that leads the
administrator through the process. For example, a맕etwork operating system setup program might
provide a series of graphical windows that lead the administrator through the process of:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Installing a new protocol.</li></p>

<p><li> Changing the order in which the installed protocols have been linked.</li></p>

<p><li> Removing a protocol.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="335"><h2>Exercise 6.1 (b): Matching the OSI Model Layers with Communication Tasks</h2></A>

protocol stacks developed earlier don't match the OSI reference model; in맚hose stacks, tasks are
often grouped together.</p>

<p>Communication tasks can be classified into three groups. In this part of the exercise, the
seven layers of the OSI reference model are again listed in the left column. In the right column, write

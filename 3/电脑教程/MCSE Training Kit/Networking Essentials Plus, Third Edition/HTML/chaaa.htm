<h2>Lesson 1: What Is a Network</h2>

<a name="ans01"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>What is a computer network?</li></p>

<p><b>A computer network is a system in which a number of independent computers are linked
together to share data and peripherals, such as hard disks and printers.</b></p>

<p><li>What are three advantages of using a computer network?</li></p>

<p><b>Three advantages of using a computer network are the ability to share information (or
data), to share hardware and software, and to centralize administration and support.</b></p>

<p><li>Give two examples of a LAN configuration.</li></p>

<p><b>The most basic version of a LAN is two computers that are connected by a cable. An example
of a more complex LAN is hundreds of connected computers and peripherals scattered throughout a
large organization, such as a municipality. In both cases, the LAN is confined to a limited
geographic area.</b></p>

<p><li>Give two examples of a WAN configuration.</li></p>

<p><b>Because a WAN has no geographical limitations, it can connect computers and other devices
in separate cities or on opposite sides of the world. A multinational corporation with linked
computers in different countries is using a WAN. Probably the ultimate WAN is the
Internet.</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 2: Network Configuration</h2>

<a name="ans02"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>List three factors that can influence the choice of whether to implement a peer-to-peer or server-based network configuration.</li></p>

<p><b>Three factors that can influence the choice of whether to implement a peer-to-peer or
server-based network configuration are the size of the organization, the level of security
required, and the type of business being conducted.</b></p>

<p><b>Other factors include the level of administrative support available, the amount of network
traffic, the needs of the network users, and the network budget.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe the advantages of a peer-to-peer network.</li></p>

<p><b>Peer-to-peer networks are relatively simple and inexpensive. They require no dedicated
servers and no administrators, and are connected by a simple, easily visible cabling
system.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe the advantages of a server-based network.</li></p>

<p><b>Server-based networks have a number of advantages over peer-to-peer networks. They can
accommodate a larger number of users; they have servers which can be specialized to accommodate
the expanding needs of users; and they offer greater security. Server-based networks also
support e-mail systems along with application and fax servers.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans03"><h3>Exercise  1.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Which type of network would you suggest for this company?</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Peer-to-peer</li></p>

<p><li> Server-based</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>There is no completely right or wrong answer to this problem, but a server-based network is
suggested. Although there are only seven people in the entire company at present, and thus a
peer-to-peer network seems adequate, the company is experiencing growth. Additionally, some of
the information that will be sent over the network is confidential. It is better to invest in a
server-based network that can accommodate growth and provide centralized security than to
choose a peer-to-peer network that growth will render obsolete in a year or two.</b></p>

<p><li>Which network topology would be most appropriate in this situation?</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Bus</li></p>

<p><li> Ring</li></p>

<p><li> Star</li></p>

<p><li> Mesh</li></p>

<p><li> Star bus</li></p>

<p><li> Star ring</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>There is no single correct answer. The most commonly installed networks currently are the
star bus and the bus. A hub-centered star bus seems to be the best choice because of the ease
of troubleshooting and reconfiguration. Although a bus network might be chosen for its low cost
or ease of installation, it does not offer the centralized troubleshooting or administrative
advantages of a hub. A ring is probably more complex than is necessary for this network.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans04"><h3>Exercise  1.2: Troubleshooting Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Why are problems arising concerning who has which document? Suggest at least one
reason.</li></p>

<p><b>The network has clearly outgrown the friendly, trusting, give-and-take style of the
workgroup. The number of new users, the undefined nature of their responsibilities on the
network, and the increased traffic of network-intensive applications make the peer-to-peer
approach inadequate.</b></p>

<p><li>What one change could you make that would give you centralized control of the access to
these documents?</li></p>

<p><b>Add a dedicated server and administrator, and implement a network operating system that can
provide extensive, centralized security.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe one change that your solution will bring to the users' operating
environment. </li></p>

<p><b>Changing from peer-to-peer to server-based networking will disrupt the organization's
routine, present everyone with the challenge of adjusting to a new communications milieu, and
change the entire personality of the work environment. However, the change is required in order
for the organization to network successfully. This is why planning is so important in
implementing a network. Network planners need to stay current with evolving networking
technologies, anticipate future changes in the number of devices, and make purchasing decisions
that are cost-effective.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans05"><h3>Exercise  1.3: Network Planning Problem/Part 1</h3></a>

<ol>
The following answer pertains to Questions 1 through 8:

<p><b>An appropriate choice between peer-to-peer and server-based networking can be made only
after careful consideration of:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>The projected number of users</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The users' need for access to data</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Network management</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The number of computers acting as servers</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>A server-based network imposes a greater cost than a peer-to-peer network because at least
one of the computers on the network is dedicated to serving data, applications, or both. But a
server-based network also makes the best use of a centralized, coherent administration of
resources. This centralized administration can regulate access to data, making it secure.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans06"><h3>Exercise  1.3: Network Planning Problem/Part 2</h3></a>

<ol>

<p>The following answer pertains to Questions 1 through 5:

<p><b>If some of your servers are going to support more than one of these applications and the
number of users is large (25 users or more), you should consider adding more servers and
dedicating them to specialized tasks.</b></p>

<p><b>Some of these tasks, such as database, e-mail, or application serving, can be
resource-intensive. Each of these often requires its own server in order to provide acceptable
performance. Other server tasks, such as user directories and general data storage, are not
usually so demanding of resources and may be combined on a single computer. And some tasks,
such as backup, are usually scheduled in such a way that their impact on network performance
occurs during periods of low network activity.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="ans07"><h3>Exercise  1.3: Network Planning Problem/Part 3</h3></a>

<ol>
<p>The following answer pertains to questions 1 through 10:</p>


<p><b>Choosing an appropriate topology for your network is often difficult. The most common
network being installed today is the star bus, but that might not meet your needs. There are
several criteria you can use&#8212;based on the information you generated in Part 3 of the
Network Planning Problem&#8212;to help you make this decision. Again, there is no <i>one</i>
completely correct choice.</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>If you need an extremely reliable network with redundancy built in, you might want
to consider either a ring or a star-wired ring network.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>There are at least three considerations involved in estimating the cost of
implementing a certain topology:</b></li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Installation</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Troubleshooting</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Maintenance</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> <b>Eventually, topology translates into cabling, and the installation phase is where
theoretical topology meets the real world of the actual network. If cost is an overriding
factor, then perhaps you should choose the topology that you can install at the lowest
cost.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Ninety percent of the cost of wiring is applied to labor. Anytime cabling has to
be permanently installed in any kind of structure, the initial cost multiplies rapidly because
of the high cost of labor and expertise.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>When a network requires installing cable in a structure, a star bus is usually
less expensive to install than a bus. To illustrate this, imagine the task of wiring a large
building for a bus network. Then, imagine what it would take to reconfigure that network six
months later to add eight new computers. Finally, imagine how much more economically and
efficiently those same operations could be performed if the installation were a star
bus.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>For a small network (5-10 users), a bus is usually economical to install initially
but may be expensive to maintain because troubleshooting and reconfiguring take time. However,
on a larger network (20 or more users), installing a star bus may cost more initially than
installing a bus, owing to the cost of the equipment (a hub); but a star bus will be
significantly less expensive to maintain in the long run.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Finally, if there is installed network cabling that you can reuse, you might
choose the existing topology if it meets your needs.</b></li></p>
</ul>
</ol>

<a name="ans09"><h3>Chapter Review</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Describe the difference between a LAN and a WAN.</li></p>

<p><b>A LAN, or local area network, is the basic building block of any computer network. It can
consist of a simple network (two computers connected by a cable and sharing information) or up
to several hundred computers connected and sharing information and resources. A LAN
has geographical limits, but a WAN has no geographical limits. A WAN can connect several
departments within the same building or buildings on  opposite sides of the world. Today, the
ultimate WAN is the World Wide Web.</b></p>

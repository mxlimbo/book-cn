<h2>Lesson 1: Documenting a Running Network</h2>

<a name="ans50"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>What is a baseline of network performance? Why should you have one? How can you
use it to determine if changes should be made to the network?</li></p>

<p><b>A baseline is simply documentation of the network's normal operating values. The
baseline needs to be updated whenever users, hardware, or software are added to or subtracted
from the system. Administrators should be able to refer to a network baseline in order to
compare current network performance with previous performance. A significant decline in
performance numbers can indicate a need to upgrade the network.</b></p>

<p><li>What are network monitors and protocol analyzers? What part do they play in documenting
network performance? In what ways can they alert you to degradation of network
performance?</li></p>

<p><b>A network monitor is a tool that captures and filters data packets and analyzes network
activity. A protocol analyzer is a tool that keeps track of network statistics. It can capture
bad frames and isolate their source. Together, these two tools can alert you to network
performance and help isolate the source of network degradation. The information they provide
can help you solve network performance problems more quickly.</b></p>

<p><li>Should the documentation that makes up a network history include specific information
about the network's hardware and software? If so, why?</li></p>

<p><b>Yes. Network documentation should contain a map of hardware for the entire network, server
information, and software information such as licensing and support details. This information
will provide a good foundation upon which to identify future needs for network
modification.</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 2: Upgrading a Network</h2>

<a name="ans51"><h3>Exercise  12.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>You have been assigned to upgrade a network for a small manufacturer. Its network
has been in place since 1989. Only minor upgrades or same-model equipment replacements have
occurred. The network is configured as peer-to-peer, and there is no file server. The media is
coaxial thicknet cable (Standard Ethernet). The network computers are 386-33 PCs. The operating
system is Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The company uses shareware word-processing applications
and spreadsheets as its office software.</p>

<p>The company would like to upgrade to a server-based network. It is adding office space to
the building and would like to rewire the network with flexible, inexpensive media. The company
is about to begin using new, powerful design software in its manufacturing process.</p>

<p>What do you recommend for the upgrade?</p>

<p><b>Add a mid-sized file server, and install server network software.
Rewire with unshielded twisted-pair cabling. Upgrade the workstations to Pentium-class
computers, and install workstation network software. Upgrade to an &quot;Office Suite&quot;
software product for daily office operations. Install the new design software and test. Confirm
the installation and train the end users as appropriate.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 3: Moving a Network</h2>

<a name="ans52"><h3>Exercise  12.2: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>You have been assigned to move your company's file server, 10 workstations and
two printers to a new office 500 miles away. The new office has been wired for the new network.
Management has told you that the new network must be operational before the old one is turned
off, because the business cannot afford any downtime. However, there will be no additional
equipment purchased for the new office.</p>

<p>Can this network be moved without any downtime? If so, how? If not, what is your plan for
relocating this network?</p>

<p><b>Because no equipment will be available to run a mirrored network
during the relocation, this network must have some downtime. This move is best scheduled for a
weekend. The move should include planning for coordination of staff during the discontinuation
of the old network, packing, moving, and unpacking of equipment, installation of the
workstation peripherals and server, testing each device for functionality and confirming the
operation of the network as a whole.</b></p>

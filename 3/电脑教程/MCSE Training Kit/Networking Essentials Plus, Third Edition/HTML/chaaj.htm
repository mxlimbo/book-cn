<h2>Lesson 1: Making Networks Secure</h2>

<a name="ans42"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Describe two common ways by which unauthorized users can gain access to
a network; for each, describe how unauthorized access can be prevented.</li></p>

<p><b>Unauthorized users can gain access to most peer-to-peer networks by typing in a unique
username and password at any of the networked computers. The best preventative measures include
making the networked computers physically inaccessible by locking the area that contains them,
or to enable BIOS security which allows the user to set a computer access name and
password.</b></p>

<p><b>Unauthorized users can also access a server-based network by using someone else's name
and password. The best way to prevent this is to have an enforced password policy in which
passwords are not written down and are changed regularly.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe the differences between password-protected shares and access permissions.</li></p>

<p><b>Password-protected shares require that a password be assigned to each shared resource.
Access to the shared resource is granted when a user enters the correct password.
Access-permission security involves assigning certain rights on a user-by-user basis. A user
types a password when logging on to the network. The server validates this user name and
password combination and uses it to grant or deny access to shared resources.</b></p>

<p><li>Define data encryption and DES.</li></p>

<p><b>Data encryption is the scrambling of data to make it inaccessible to unauthorized persons.
In a network environment, data can be encrypted before being sent onto the network. This makes
the data unreadable, even by someone who taps the cable and attempts to read the data as it
passes over the network. When the data arrives at the proper computer, the code for deciphering
encrypted data decodes the bits, translating them into understandable information.</b></p>

<p><b>The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was developed by IBM and adopted as a specification for
encryption by the government of the United States. DES describes how data should be encrypted
and provides the specifications for the key to decryption. Both the sender and the receiver
need to have access to the decryption key. Because the only way to get the key from one
location to another is to physically or electronically transmit it, DES is vulnerable to
unauthorized interception.</b></p>

<p><li>Identify four common types of computer viruses and describe how they are transmitted;
describe three ways to help protect computers in a network against viruses.</li></p>

<p><b>Four types of computer virus are called companion, macro, polymorphic and stealth. Each is
a kind of file infector virus. They can be transmitted by any physical means such as CDs,
floppy disks or a direct cable connection between computers, and by electronic means such as
e-mail and internet downloads. Three means of protection against a computer virus are the
installation of current anti-virus software, write-protection of disks, and disabling macro
capabilities in vulnerable software.</b></p>
</ol>

<h2>Lesson 2: Maintaining a Healthy Network Environment</h2>

<a name="ans43"><h3>Lesson Checkup</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Describe the ways in which heat, humidity, dust, and smoke can each have an
adverse effect on computer health. For each, describe preventive measures that can be taken to
protect computers in such environments.</li></p>

<p><b>If the room temperature in which the equipment is located is too high, a computer's
cooling fan and ventilation slots will be unable to maintain the correct operating temperature
and components will begin to overheat and fail.</b></p>

<p><b>High humidity promotes corrosion. Corroded contacts on cable connections and expansion
cards will cause intermittent failures. Corrosion can also increase the resistance of
electrical components, leading to a temperature increase that can be followed by component
failure or fire.</b></p>

<p><b>Dust is electrostatically attracted to electronic equipment. It acts as an insulator that
affects the cooling of components, causing them to overheat. Excessive dust on electronic
equipment can cause electrical shorts and catastrophic equipment failure.</b></p>

<p><b>Smoke coats the surfaces of electronic components, acting as both insulator and conductor.
Smoke residue also enhances the accumulation of dust.</b></p>

<p><b>Because electronic equipment is designed to operate within the same range of temperature
and humidity that feels comfortable to human beings, the best preventative measure is to
provide the computers with just such an environment.</b></p>

<p><li>Identify some of the human factors that can unintentionally alter a computer's
operating environment. Describe the consequences to a computer of these factors, and suggest
some preventive measures for each.</li></p>

<p><b>Because few employees have any awareness of the ventilation requirements for computer
equipment, they impede the natural flow of air in and around the equipment. Once this happens,
maintaining the proper temperature is impossible and failures begin. The spilling of liquid
refreshment takes a toll on keyboards and computers. When it gets cold outside, space heaters
are used in under-heated offices and are usually placed under the desk, often in close
proximity to computers. This can present two problems: the computer becomes overheated, and the
space heaters can overload power outlets, tripping circuit breakers or even causing fires.
Humans can spill liquids such as coffee on computers, impede the flow of the computer's
cooling air, and overheat computers with space heaters. The liquids can destroy the
computer's internal circuitry and make keyboards unusable. Blocked air flow can cause a
computer to overheat and burn out electronic components. The best preventative measure is to
make computer users aware of the consequences of such behaviors.</b></p>

<p><li>Identify the principal hidden and industrial factors that can affect a network's
health. Include out-of-view network equipment in both an office, and a manufacturing
environment. Discuss what precautions can be taken, or what changes might need to be made, for
each of these hidden and industrial factors.</li></p>

<p><b>Hidden factors include network wiring that runs through an attic, within walls or is
otherwise invisible can be damaged during repairs to other objects in those spaces. Insects and
rodents can use network materials for construction purposes of their own.</b></p>

<p><b>Industrial factors include noise, electromagnetic interference (EMI), vibration, corrosive
and explosive environments, and untrained and unskilled workers.</b></p>

<p><b>These factors can be addressed by installing the networking equipment in separate
enclosures with outside ventilation by using fiber-optic cabling to reduce electrical
interference and corrosion problems with the cable by making sure that all equipment is
properly grounded and by providing proper training to all employees that need to use the
equipment.</b></p>

<a name="ans44"><h3>Exercise  10.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>A small organization recently suffered security breaches in its peer-to-peer
network. The intruder stole valuable business data. The organization's need for security
became apparent, and now a modest-sized, but more secure,<br>
server-based network is in place.</p>

<p>The organization is located in a small California community that experiences frequent
earthquakes and power outages. Your job is to plan how to avoid breaches of security and plan
for disaster recovery at the same time. In this exercise, examine preventive measures the
organization can take to avoid data loss due to human activities and natural disasters such as
earthquakes.</p>

<p>List the categories of things that can put the organization's data at risk. Discuss the
preventive measures and recovery plans appropriate for each kind of data loss.</p>

<p><b>An organization's data can be put at risk by:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>component failure.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>computer viruses.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>data deletion and corruption.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>fire caused by arson or electrical mishaps.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>natural disasters, such as lightning, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>power-supply failure and power surges.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>theft and vandalism.</b></li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>An organization can take the following preventive measures to
avoid data loss due to human activities and natural disasters:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Use of tape and optical storage backup systems to minimize the risk of losing
data. By maintaining current backup copies of existing files, data can be recovered if harm
comes to the original data.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Installation of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) will allow computers to keep
servers or other devices running in the event of a power failure. The best UPS systems perform
online. When the power source fails, the UPS batteries automatically take over. The process is
invisible to users.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Incorporation of fault-tolerant disk systems such as Redundant Array
of Independent Disks (RAID), Sector Sparing and disk clustering will protect data by
duplicating data or by placing data in different physical sources, such as different partitions
or different disks. Data redundancy allows access to data even if part of the data system
fails.</b></li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Disaster-recovery success is only as good as the disaster
prevention and preparedness measures taken beforehand.</b></p>

<p><b>The only protection from a data-loss disaster is to implement one
or more of the methods described earlier to back up data. Store your backups in a secure place,
such as a bank safe deposit box, away from the network site. To fully recover from any disaster
you will need to:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Make a disaster-recovery plan.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Implement the plan.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Test the plan.</b></li></p>
</ul>

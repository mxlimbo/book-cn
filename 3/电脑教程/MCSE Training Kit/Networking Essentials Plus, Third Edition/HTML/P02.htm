<h1>Implementing a Network</h1>

<p>In Part ll, our focus shifts from overview to implementation, and we begin the process of putting together the elements from Part l. Here, our emphasis is on the nuts and bolts of designing and rolling out a complete network: choosing a network type (peer-to-peer or server-based), selecting hardware and software for installation, and choosing and establishing security through shares and accounts. We also take a look at environmental factors that affect networks, as well as administering, upgrading, troubleshooting, and relocating networks.

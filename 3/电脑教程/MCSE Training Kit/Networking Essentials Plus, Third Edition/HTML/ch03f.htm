<A NAME="202"><h1>Lesson 5: AppleTalk and ArcNet</h1></A>
<p>In lessons <a href="ch03d.htm#168">3</a> and <a href="ch03e.htm#187">4</a>, we discussed the two most popular network architectures: Ethernet and
Token Ring. Networking professionals also might encounter and be required to support two other
architectures: AppleTalk and ArcNet. The AppleTalk architecture is used in the Apple Macintosh
environment, while the ArcNet architecture is used in personal computer-based environments.
Since the advent of Ethernet, the popularity of ArcNet has decreased.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Identify the components and features of AppleTalk.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify the components and features of ArcNet.</li></p>

<A NAME="203"><h2>The AppleTalk Environment</h2></A>
<p>Apple Computer, Inc. introduced AppleTalk in 1983 as proprietary network architecture for
small groups. Networking functions are built into Macintosh computers, which makes the
AppleTalk network very simple to set up compared to other networks.</p>

<p>The primary terms used in the Apple environment can be confusing because they sound similar
to terms used in other environments, but relate to different aspects of a network. The
following aspects of Apple networking are addressed:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> AppleTalk</li></p>

<p><li> LocalTalk</li></p>

<p><li> AppleShare</li></p>

<p><li> EtherTalk</li></p>

<p><li> TokenTalk</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="204"><h3>AppleTalk</h3></A>
<p>AppleTalk is the Apple network architecture and is included in the Macintosh operating
system software. Figure 3.29 shows a typical AppleTalk network configuration. This means that
network capabilities are built into every Macintosh. Appletalk Phase 1 is obsolete. AppleTalk
Phase 2 is the current release of AppleTalk. The architecture is a collection of protocols that
correspond to the OSI reference model. The OSI reference model is discussed in detail in <A HREF="ch05a.htm#285">Chapter 5</A>,&quot;Introducing Network Standards.&quot;</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.29</b> <i>AppleTalk network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>When a device attached to an AppleTalk network comes online, three things happen in the
following order:</p>

<ol>
<li> The device checks to see if it has stored an address from a previous networking session.
If not, the device assigns itself an address chosen at random from a range of allowable
addresses.</li>

<p><li> The device broadcasts the address to determine if any other device is using it.</li></p>

<p><li>If no other device is using the address, the device stores the address to use the next time the device comes online.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="205"><h3>LocalTalk</h3></A>
<p>AppleTalk networks are commonly referred to as LocalTalk networks. LocalTalk uses CSMA/CA as
an access method in a bus or tree topology with shielded, twisted-pair cabling, but will also
accept fiber-optic and UTP cable. LocalTalk is inexpensive because it is built into Macintosh
hardware. But, because of its comparatively modest performance (the maximum communication data
rate for LocalTalk is 230.4 Kbps), and because LocalTalk NICs for PC-compatible computers are
obsolete, LocalTalk is not as widely used as Ethernet or Token Ring in large business networks.
Figure 3.30 shows the LocalTalk cable and connectors.</p>

<p>LocalTalk also refers to the physical cabling components as well as to the data-link layer
protocol. These include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Cables.</li></p>

<p><li> Connector modules.</li></p>

<p><li> Cable extenders.</li></p>
</ul>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.30</b> <i>LocalTalk connector module with a LocalTalk cable</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>STP cabling is most often used in a bus or tree topology. A LocalTalk network supports a
maximum of 32 devices.</p>

<p>Because of LocalTalk's limitations, manufacturers other than Apple are often preferred
for cabling. Farallon PhoneNet, for example, can handle 254 devices. PhoneNet uses telephone
cable and connectors and can be implemented as a bus network or plugged into a central wiring
hub to form a star topology.</p>

<A NAME="206"><h3>AppleShare</h3></A>
<p>AppleShare is the file server on an AppleTalk network. The client software 
is included with every copy of the Apple operating system. There is also an AppleShare print
server, which is a server-based print spooler.</p>

<p><b>Zones</b></p>

<p>Individual LocalTalk networks can be joined together into one larger network through the use
of logical groupings called <i>zones</i>. Figure 3.31 shows three LocalTalk zones connected.
Each connected subnetwork is identified by a zone name. Users in one LocalTalk network can
access the services in another network simply by selecting that zone. This is helpful for
accessing file servers in a variety of small networks, thereby expanding the size of the
network. Networks using other architectures, such as Token Ring, can also be joined to an
AppleTalk network in this way.</p>

<p>Conversely, working groups on a single LocalTalk network can be subdivided into zones to
relieve congestion on a busy network. Each zone, for example, 
can have its own print server.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.31</b> <i>Three zones joined together to form a larger network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="207"><h3>EtherTalk</h3></A>
<p>EtherTalk allows the AppleTalk network protocols to run on Ethernet coaxial cable. As
described in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; there are two types of coaxial cable:
thinnet and thicknet.</p>

<p>The EtherTalk card allows a Macintosh computer to connect to an 802.3 Ethernet network.
EtherTalk software is included with the card and is compatible with AppleTalk Phase 2.</p>

<A NAME="208"><h3>TokenTalk</h3></A>
<p>The TokenTalk card is an expansion card that allows a Macintosh to connect to an 802.5 Token
Ring network. TokenTalk software is included with the card and is compatible with AppleTalk
Phase 2.</p>

<A NAME="209"><h3>AppleTalk Considerations</h3></A>
<p>Computers from companies other than Apple can also use AppleTalk. These include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> IBM personal computers and compatibles.</li></p>

<p><li> IBM mainframe computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Some UNIX computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Apple welcomes third-party product development. As a result, the AppleTalk environment is
populated by products from a variety of vendors.</p>

<A NAME="210"><h2>The ArcNet Environment</h2></A>
<p>Datapoint Corporation developed the Attached Resource Computer Network (ArcNet) in 1977.
Figure 3.32 shows a star-wired ArcNet. It is a simple, inexpensive, flexible network
architecture designed for workgroup-size networks. The first ArcNet cards were shipped in
1983.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/F03xx32.JPG" width=339 height=275 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.32</b> <i>Simple star-wired ArcNet network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>ArcNet technology predates IEEE Project 802 standards, but loosely maps to the 802.4
document. This specifies the standards for token-passing bus networks using broadband cable. An
ArcNet network can have a star-bus or bus topology.</p>

<A NAME="211"><h3>How ArcNet Works</h3></A>
<p>ArcNet uses a token-passing access method in a star-bus topology (shown in Figure 3.33)
passing data at 2.5 Mbps. ArcNet Plus, a successor to the original ArcNet, supports data
transmission rates of 20 Mbps.</p>

<p>Because ArcNet is a token-passing architecture, a computer in an ArcNet network must have
the token in order to transmit data. The token moves from one computer to the next according to
the order in which they are connected to the hub, regardless of how they are physically located
in the network environment. This means that the token moves from computer 1 to computer 2 (hub
connections) in order, even if computer 1 is at one end of the building and computer 2 is at
the other end of the building.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/F03xx33.JPG" width=365 height=293 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.33</b> <i>Token movement based on numerical order</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The standard ArcNet packet (Figure 3.34) contains:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A destination address.</li></p>

<p><li> A source address.</li></p>

<p><li> Up to 508 bytes of data (or 4096 bytes of data in ArcNet Plus).</li></p>
</ul>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.34</b> <i>An ArcNet packet contains source and destination addresses</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="212"><h3>Hardware</h3></A>
<p>Each computer is connected by cable to a hub. The hubs can be active, passive, or smart. As
discussed in Chapter 1, <a href="ch01b.htm#33">Lesson 1: What is a Network?</a>, passive hubs merely relay the signal.
Active hubs can regenerate and relay signals. Smart hubs have all the features of active hubs
and usually add diagnostic features such as reconfiguration detection and operator
control-of-port connections.</p>

<p>The standard cabling used for ArcNet is 93-ohm RG-62 A/U, coaxial cable. ArcNet also
supports twisted-pair and fiber-optic media. The distances between computers vary, depending on
the cabling and the topology.</p>

<p>Using coaxial cable with BNC connectors and active hubs, a maximum cable distance of 610
meters (2000 feet) from a workstation to the hub can be achieved with a star topology. The
maximum distance on a linear-bus segment is only 305 meters (1000 feet).</p>

<p>When unshielded twisted-pair cable with either RJ-11 or RJ-45 connectors is used, there is a
maximum cable distance of 244 meters (800 feet) between devices on both star and bus
topologies.</p>

<p>A small public relations firm leases two groups of offices in Building A and Building G of a
suburban office park. The business staff, including the human resources and accounting
departments, has 12 people and is located in two offices in Building A. The creative staff,
including copy writing, graphics, and production departments, with a total of 22 employees, is
housed in Building G. Building A and Building G are about 600 meters (about 1970 feet)
apart.</p>

<p>The business staff is networked with a four-year-old coaxial bus that ties their
PC-compatible computers together in a peer-to-peer workgroup. The creative staff in Building G
has a conglomeration of computers including Apple Macintoshes and PC-compatibles; they are not
networked.</p>

<p>The owners of the company would like to network all the computers for the creative staff and

<A NAME="215"><h2>Exercise 3.2: Troubleshooting Problem</h2></A>
<p>You will need to draw on information presented in chapters <a href="ch01a.htm">1</a> and <a href="ch02a.htm">2</a> as well as this one to
solve this problem. Use your knowledge of network architectures to troubleshoot the situation
described below and create a possible solution.</p>

<A NAME="216"><h3>Background Information</h3></A>
<p>You have a 500-node 10BaseT network. It started with 50 nodes five years ago, and you have
been expanding it constantly since then. Recently the network has started to suffer from slow
response time to the end users, and you have identified the network as the bottleneck. The
vendor that you have been working with for the last two years recommends moving to 100BaseX.
The vendor says that all you need to do is put the new 100BaseX NICs in your computers, replace
your hubs with 100BaseX hubs, and you will be up and running.</p>

<A NAME="217"><h3>The Problem</h3></A>
<p>You and several technicians from your vendor spend an entire weekend installing the new
cards and replacing hubs on your network. When the staff arrive at work on Monday morning, most
are ecstatic with the performance of the new network, but about 50 staff members report that
they cannot connect to the network. When you investigate further, you notice that all 50 are
working at stations that had been cabled at least four or five years earlier.</p>

<ol>
<p><li> List at least two things that could cause those nodes to fail to function.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
This list contains the most common errors that could be causing the problem, but
these are not the only correct possibilities.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2"> What could you do to resolve each of the possible causes you listed above?</li></p>
</ol>

<p><a href="chaac.htm#ans12">Answers</a></p>

<p><img src="images/practic.JPG" width=68 height=54 border="0"></p>

<A NAME="218"><h2>Exercise 3.3: Network Planning Problem</h2></A>
<p>Research has shown that about 90 percent of all new network installations use Ethernet
10BaseT with Category 5 UTP. Category 5 allows you to install a 
10-Mbps solution now and upgrade it to a 100-Mbps solution later. However, despite its
popularity, Ethernet 10BaseT may not be suitable for all situations.</p>

<p>Because the cost of labor accounts for most of the expense of cable installation, there is
little difference in cost between using Category 3 UTP and Category 5 UTP cable. Most new
installations use Category 5 because it supports transmission speeds of up to 100 Mbps.</p>

<p>The IBM Cabling System is used in a Token Ring environment. The star-wired topology makes
moves, changes, and additions simple and easy. Figure 3.35 shows a patch panel with three
computers connected. Moving a patch cable on the distribution panel can make changes.</p>

<p>Additionally, a number of minicomputer and mainframe systems have built-in Token Ring
connections. Cable manufacturers other than IBM also make Token Ring cabling, of which UTP is
the most popular.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03xx35x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03xx35.JPG" width=404 height=297 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.35</b> <i>A patch panel makes moving computers easy</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>This UTP star-wired Token Ring network transmits data at 16 Mbps. Changes can be made easily
by simply moving a modular patch cord on the patch panel. This network simplifies management by
using an intelligent MSAU. Some intelligent MSAUs allow distances of up to 100 meters (330
feet) to each network lobe (the cable distance between the MSAU and a computer). This cabling
scheme follows AT&amp;T wiring standards, which make it fully compatible with all 10BaseT
applications. It is also compatible with 4-Mbps Token Ring networks.</p>

<p>Because 10BaseT is currently the most popular implementation of the Ethernet architecture,
it should be chosen unless there is a compelling reason to choose something else. Therefore, in
a case where any architecture will work, 10BaseT should be given first consideration.</p>

<p>Make a check mark on the line next to the choice that applies to your site. To determine
which type of architecture would be most appropriate for your site, simply total the number of
check marks for each indicator. The indicator with the most check marks should be the first
option you consider.</p>

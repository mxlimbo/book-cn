Windows&#160;98 is a 32-bit desktop operating system that is designed to support a wide range of hardware and software, while Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0 is designed to be the most powerful 32-bit desktop operating system. For many sites, a mix of both systems will provide the best business solution.

<A NAME="692"><H1>Lesson 1: An Overview of System Policies</H1></A><P>
This lesson provides an overview of system policies. System policies offer a powerful mechanism for network administrators to increase control and manageability of desktop computers across a network. You can use system policies as part of your remote administration program in order to manage your domain or network more efficiently.
<P>
As a support professional, you need to understand what system policies can do and how they affect computers running Windows&#160;98. You can use Windows&#160;98 system policy files with a Windows&#160;NT or Novell NetWare network server when Windows&#160;98 is used as a client on either network.
<P>
The decision to implement system policies should be based on a thorough understanding of their value and limitations and when it is appropriate to use them.

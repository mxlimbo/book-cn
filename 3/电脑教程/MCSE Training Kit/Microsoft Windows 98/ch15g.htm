A user profile consists of configuration settings that control the user's computer environment. User profiles are useful when multiple users share a single computer, or when a single user uses multiple computers.
<P>
Local user profiles exist only on the computer that the user logs on to, and control the settings for that specific user and computer. Local user profiles are an appropriate solution for multiple users sharing a single computer.
<P>
Roaming profiles exist on a server and are downloaded to the client computer when the user logs on. Roaming profiles are an appropriate solution when an individual user logs on to different computers.

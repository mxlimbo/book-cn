<A NAME="106"><H2>Five&#150;Phase Setup in MS-DOS</H2></A><P>
Several installation steps are the same, whether you run Windows&#160;98 Setup from MS-DOS or from Windows&#160;95. They include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Creating the Emergency Startup Disk (ESD), part of Phase 2&#151;Collecting information about your computer
<P>
<LI>Phase 3&#151;Copying Windows&#160;98 files to your computer
<P>
<LI>Phase 4&#151;Restarting your computer
</UL>
<P>
However, when you run Setup from MS-DOS, the following additional steps take place:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>During Phase 1&#151;Preparing to run Windows&#160;98 Setup:
<P>
Real-mode ScanDisk performs a routine check on your system.
<P>
The Mini.cab file is expanded, and its files are copied to the C:\Wininst0.400 folder. This file contains the run-time version of Windows required for Setup.
<P>
<LI>During Phase 2&#151;Collecting Information About Your Computer:
<P>
You choose the Install Directory.
<P>
You select the Setup type (Typical, Compact, Portable, or Custom) and, depending on the Setup type, which optional components are to be installed.
<P>
You specify user and computer information.
<P>
<LI>During Phase 5&#151;Setting Up Hardware and Finalizing Settings:
<P>
Hardware detection of non-Plug and Play devices is performed after Plug and Play enumeration and before Setup restarts your computer for the second time during the finalizing settings portion of this phase.

<A NAME="781"><H2>Using Security Zones</H2></A><P>
You can control access to the Internet by dividing the Web into <I>zones. </I>A zone is a grouping of sites with the same security level. You assign a web site to a zone, and Internet Explorer notifies you about potential security problems related to the site according to the security level for that zone.
<P>
Security levels also determine how Internet Explorer reacts when you connect to a page that has components such as ActiveX controls or Java applets, which produce animation and other multimedia effects. In addition, security levels can determine several other options, including whether or not a user can download files or launch applications from a Web page.
<P>
<A NAME="782"><H3>Security Zones</H3></A><P>
Internet Explorer has four predefined zones that have default security levels.

<P>
If you want to configure security zones, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	On the Internet Explorer <B>View</B> menu, click <B>Internet Options</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Security</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Select the zone you wish to configure from the <B>Zone</B> menu.
<P>
<LI>	Click the desired security level for that zone.
</OL>
<P>
You can modify the security level for each zone, which gives you more control over security options. In addition, you can customize each security level by choosing <B>Custom</B>, then clicking <B>Settings</B>.
<P>
You can add sites to the local intranet, restricted sites, and trusted sites security zones. All Web sites that are not included in one of the other zones are assigned automatically to the Internet zone.

<A NAME="200"><H2>Data Transfer Rates</H2></A><P>
USB supports two data transfer protocols: <I>isochronous</I> and <I>asynchronous</I>. An isochronous connection transfers data at a guaranteed, fixed rate of delivery. This is required to support the demands of multimedia applications and devices. Asynchronous data can be transferred whenever there is no isochronous traffic on the bus. USB supports the following data transfer rates, depending on the amount of bus bandwidth a peripheral device requires:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1.5 megabits per second (Mbps), for devices that do not require a large amount of bandwidth such as mouse devices and keyboards.
<P>
<LI>12 Mbps isochronous transfer rate, for high-bandwidth devices such as modems, speakers, scanners, and monitors. An isochronous connection transfers data at a guaranteed, fixed rate of delivery. Guaranteed data delivery is required to support the demands of multimedia applications and devices.
</UL>
<P>
The USB host determines the bus transfer rate as well as the priority assigned to a data stream.

<A NAME="671"><H2>Loading Local Profiles</H2></A><P>
Each time a user logs on, Windows&#160;98 searches the registry under the following key to determine whether the user has a local user profile:
<P>
<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
ProfileList</PRE>
<P>
Windows&#160;98 applies user-specific settings based on the information contained in the User.dat file. If a profile is not found for a user, a dialog box appears, stating that this is the first time that the user has logged on at this computer. The dialog box asks if the user would like to save configuration settings for future access. If the user consents, Windows&#160;98 creates and stores a user profile in the registry.
<P>
If a user chooses not to create a profile, or clicks Cancel in the logon dialog box, the default user profile is loaded. The default user profile settings are stored in HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT in the Windows Registry.
<P>
You can change the default profile when you are prompted to log on during the Windows&#160;98 Startup process.
<P>
If you want to change the default profile, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Start Windows&#160;98.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 displays the <B>Enter Password</B> dialog box.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Cancel</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Make the desired changes to the configuration settings.
<P>
<LI>	Log off.
<P>
The settings in effect when you log off become the default profile.
</OL>

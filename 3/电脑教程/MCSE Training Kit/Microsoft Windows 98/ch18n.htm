This lesson discusses configuring Dial-Up Networking clients. The way in which you configure a dial-up connection depends on the type of dial-up server to which you are connecting. 
<P>
The default dial-up networking settings are appropriate for most dial-up connections. However, you can configure each connection by choosing a different server type and protocol. You can customize Dial-Up Networking connections by creating dial-up scripts. In addition, you can use multiple physical links (Multilink) with a single connection to increase transmission bandwidth and speed.

<A NAME="641"><H2>Installing and Configuring File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks</H2></A><P>
With Windows&#160;98, you can use <B>File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks</B> to share resources with NetWare clients. To a NetWare client, even an MS-DOS client running the <B>netx</B> requestor, your computer appears as a NetWare server.
<P>
File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks has the following requirements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol must be installed. If it is not installed, it installs automatically with File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks.
<P>
<LI>Client for NetWare Networks must be installed. If it is not installed, it installs automatically with File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks.
<P>
<LI>A bindery-based NetWare server must act as a security provider. File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks does not support share-level security or NetWare Directory Services.
</UL>

<A NAME="643"><H3>Configuring File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks</H3></A><P>
File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks has two configurable properties: Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) advertising and workgroup advertising.
<P>
<A NAME="644"><H4>SAP Advertising</H4></A><P>
Only real-mode NetWare clients require SAP advertising. With this setting enabled, the Windows&#160;98 computer uses SAP to advertise its services every 60 seconds. The computer appears on the list of NetWare servers returned by the <B>nlist server /b</B> command. Because this setting causes additional broadcast traffic and overloads the SAP browsing model, use SAP advertising only with NetWare clients that require the property.
<P>
Because Windows&#160;98 clients do not rely on SAP, this setting is disabled by default.
<P>
<A NAME="645"><H4>Workgroup Advertising</H4></A><P>
With this setting enabled, the Windows&#160;98 computer advertises its service using the Microsoft browser broadcasts. The computer appears with the rest of the workgroup servers in <B>Network Neighborhood</B>, but does not appear on the list of servers reported by the <B>nlist server /b</B> command. If you do not configure your computer for SAP advertising, a client running <B>netx</B> or <B>vlm</B> cannot browse or connect to the computer. The default setting is <B>Enabled: May be Master</B>, which means your computer may be elected to be the computer that maintains the workgroup server list. Unless you understand the browsing process on Microsoft networks, you should not change this setting.

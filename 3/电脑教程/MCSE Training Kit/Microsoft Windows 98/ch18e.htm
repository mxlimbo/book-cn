You can use Dial-Up Networking in many ways (see Figure 18.1). For example, in the following situations:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Your company employs salespeople, support personnel, or other employees who often travel to customer sites and require remote access to the company network. These remote users can use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the network from their Windows&#160;98-based notebook computers.
<P>
<LI>Your company is not physically connected to the Internet, but some users require occasional Internet access. You can use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the Internet on demand.
<P>
<LI>Your company wants to provide remote access to a user's onsite computer. You can use Dial-Up Networking to make the user's onsite computer a Dial-Up Server, so the user can connect to it remotely.
</UL>

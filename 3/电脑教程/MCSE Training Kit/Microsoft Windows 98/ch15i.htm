One way to enable user profiles is with the Passwords icon in Control Panel.
<P>
If you want to enable user profiles, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Passwords</B> icon in Control Panel, then click the <B>User</B> <B>Profiles</B> tab (see Figure 15.2).
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Users can customize their preferences and desktop settings</B>.
</OL>

<P>
With this method, Windows&#160;98 creates a default profile that contains the settings in use at the time that you enable user profiles. New users have the option to save their settings when they log on. If a user chooses to save the settings, Windows&#160;98 creates a user profile for that user name.
<P>
On the User Profiles tab, there are two User Profile Settings options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Include desktop icons and Network Neighborhood contents in user settings.
<P>
<LI>Include Start menu and Program groups in user settings.
</UL>
<P>
You can select either or both of these settings when you enable profiles, and that selection determines which user settings apply to user profiles. If you select neither of these settings, the user profiles contain only the user-specific registry settings.

<A NAME="260"><H2>Adding New Hardware</H2></A><P>
After you physically install new hardware devices, you may have to configure the computer to recognize them. Windows&#160;98 normally detects newly installed Plug and Play hardware devices during startup or when they are physically installed. Windows&#160;98 then automatically installs driver software and configures the hardware settings. If Windows&#160;98 does not detect a hardware device, you must install it using the <B>Add New Hardware</B> icon in Control Panel.
<P>
When the <B>Add New Hardware</B> Wizard (see Figure 6.2) starts, it searches for any Plug and Play hardware not previously detected. Windows&#160;98 installs driver software and configures hardware settings for any new Plug and Play devices. If Windows&#160;98 is unsure of the hardware drivers, it prompts you to confirm the hardware type and driver location. Then, the <B>Add New Hardware</B> Wizard prompts you to search for any devices that are not Plug and Play compatible. You can choose to have Windows&#160;98 search for the device, or you can select the device from a list.

If you want to install undetected hardware:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	After the <B>Add New Hardware</B> Wizard searches for Plug and Play hardware, it prompts you to search for hardware that is not Plug and Play compatible. Click <B>Yes [Recommended]</B>.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 searches for new hardware devices that are not Plug and Play compatible, and then installs and configures any it locates. If Windows&#160;98 does not locate the device you want to install, click <B>Next</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select the hardware type, and then select the device's manufacturer and model from the list. If your device is not on the list, supply the path to a third-party driver by clicking <B>Have Disk</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Insert the installation disk and verify that the correct drive for the disk is selected in the dialog box. Click <B>OK</B> to begin installation.
</OL>

Microsoft digitally signs all drivers included with Windows&#160;98. If a driver is digitally signed, that means it passed testing done by WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs). Windows&#160;98 can check this digital signature when you install a driver. <I>Signature Checking</I> is a corporate administrator feature that is disabled by default.
<P>
You can control the signature-checking feature by setting the following registry value:
<P>
<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Driver Signing\Policy</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Value &quot;00 00 00 00&quot; sets signature checking to Level 0 and disables digital signature checking. The dialog box that identifies a digitally signed driver will not appear, and all drivers will be installed on the system whether they are signed or not.
<P>
<LI>Value &quot;01 00 00 00&quot; sets signature checking to Level 1 and enables digital signature checking. A message notifies the user that the driver has not been signed if the user tries to install a driver that fails the signature check.
<P>
<LI>Value &quot;02 00 00 00&quot; sets signature checking to Level 2 and blocks installation of any drivers that fail the signature check.

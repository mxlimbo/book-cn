<A NAME="330"><H2>Customizing a Folder with an HTML File</H2></A><P>
When you customize a folder, Windows&#160;98 creates a hidden file in the folder called Desktop.ini. This file contains information about the customized view, such as where the HTML file associated with the folder is located, or which picture displays when you open the folder.
<P>
When you use an HTML file to customize a folder, Windows&#160;98 copies the Folder.htt file from the C:\Windows\Web folder to the folder that you are customizing. You can change the way a folder displays by doing one of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Editing Folder.htt with your HTML editor.
<P>
<LI>Editing Desktop.ini for an existing HTML file you want to use, and changing the value for PersistMoniker to point to the HTML file.
</UL>

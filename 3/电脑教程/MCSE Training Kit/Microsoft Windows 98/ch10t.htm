Windows&#160;98 Help includes troubleshooting aids called <I>Troubleshooters</I> for solving problems with various system components. Troubleshooters are interactive help files that prompt you for input regarding the problems you are experiencing and the results you obtain after taking suggested actions. For instance, the <B>Startup and Shutdown Troubleshooter</B> can help you troubleshoot the boot process with the tools described earlier in this chapter.
<P>
The <B>Hardware Conflict Troubleshooter</B> (see Figure 10.6) helps you locate the source of a problem with conflicting hardware devices, and suggests corrective actions. There are numerous other <B>Troubleshooters</B> for components and functions such as networking, modem, printing, PC cards, sound, and memory.

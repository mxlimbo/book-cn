<A NAME="824"><H2>Establishing Virtual Private Networks</H2></A><P>
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects a client computer to a server by means of a <I>tunnel</I> through an intermediary network to provide a secure connection between the two computers. Tunneling is the process of wrapping a packet or message from one protocol in the packet for another. The wrapped packet then transmits over the intermediary network as a secure transmission. VPN uses a network as a transmission media. The VPN consists of the two computers (one computer at each end of the connection) and the route, or tunnel, over the public or private network.

<P>
The protocol used to create a VPN is Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). PPTP is a network protocol that uses TCP/IP-based data networks to transfer data securely from a remote client to a private enterprise server, thus creating a Virtual Private Network (see Figure 18.10). PPTP provides secure, on-demand, virtual networks over the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Dial-up lines
<P>
<LI>LANs
<P>
<LI>WANs
<P>
<LI>The Internet and other public TCP/IP-based networks
</UL>
<P>
To configure a PPTP connection, you must first install a VPN adapter. Then you can connect to a PPTP server in one of two ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and then to the PPTP server.
<P>
<LI>Connect directly to the PPTP server.
</UL>
<P>
A VPN adapter is a simulated, software-only adapter that is required for VPN support. If you want to install a VPN adapter, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click <B>Network</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration</B> tab, click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Adapter</B>, and then click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	From the list of manufacturers, select <B>Microsoft</B>, and then from the list of available devices, select <B>Microsoft Virtual Private Networking Adapter</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B> to install the adapter.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="825"><H3>Connecting to a PPTP Server through an ISP</H3></A><P>
The following procedure describes how to use Dial-Up Networking to connect to an ISP and then establish a tunnel connection to the PPTP server on the target network.
<P>
If you want to create a connection to your ISP and to a PPTP server, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	If you are using PPTP and Dial-Up Networking to connect to a PPTP server over the Internet, create a dial-up connection to your ISP, using either a modem or an ISDN adapter as the dial-up device.
<P>
<LI>	Next, create a Dial-Up Networking connection to the PPTP server. When creating this connection, specify the VPN adapter as the dial-up device. When prompted, enter either the PPTP server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address.
<P>
<LI>	Open the property dialog box for this connection and ensure the following settings on the <B>Server</B> tab match your requirements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In the <B>Allowed network protocols</B> box, ensure that the network protocols used on the target network are selected. Any selected protocol (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, or NetBEUI) must already be installed on the client workstation you are configuring. Note that TCP/IP does not need to be selected unless it is the protocol used on your target network.
<P>
<LI>If you use TCP/IP on your private network, click <B>TCP/IP Settings</B> to display the <B>TCP/IP Settings</B> dialog box. Ensure that the TCP/IP settings conform to the settings required for a client on the target network.
</LI></OL>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
The default TCP/IP settings are appropriate for most networks. Contact your network administrator for more information.

<A NAME="826"><H3>Connecting Directly to a PPTP Server</H3></A><P>
If you have a LAN connection to the PPTP server, you create a connection to the PPTP server, bypassing the connection to the ISP. You can then use the PPTP server to tunnel to any private network that is connected to that PPTP server, such as another department's private network. Data your PPTP client sends to another computer on the LAN is encrypted and secure because you are using a PPTP server to connect to the remote computer.

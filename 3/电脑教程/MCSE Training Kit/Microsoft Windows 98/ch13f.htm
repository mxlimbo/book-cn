Windows&#160;98 is fully interoperable with Windows&#160;NT. A Windows&#160;98 client running on a Windows&#160;NT network can log on to a domain, share resources with a computer running Windows&#160;NT, gain access to Microsoft BackOffice applications running on a Windows&#160;NT Server, and download user profiles and system policies.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 Client for Microsoft Networks supports the Microsoft Distributed File System for Windows&#160;NT Server, which provides a single tree structure for accessing multiple shared resources located on different servers on a network.

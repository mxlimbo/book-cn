<A NAME="225"><H2>Key Features of the Windows&#160;98 Architecture</H2></A><P>
Like Windows&#160;95, Windows&#160;98 is derived from the Windows&#160;3.1 platform and includes the following features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 32-bit <I>kernel</I> component that provides memory management and preemptive multitasking and multithreading support.
<P>
<LI>A fully integrated 32-bit, protected-mode file system, which eliminates the need to rely on MS-DOS once Windows&#160;98 starts.
<P>
<LI>32-bit installable file system drivers supporting FAT16, FAT32, ISO 9660 (CD-ROM), ISO 13346 (Universal Disk Format [UDF]/DVD), network redirection, and high performance. These file system drivers also support the use of long file names (LNFs) and an open architecture to handle future expansion.
<P>
<LI>Win32 Driver Model (WDM) support, which allows WDM-compatible devices to run under both Windows&#160;98 and future versions of Windows&#160;NT using the same driver.
<P>
<LI>Improved system-wide performance and cleanup after an application or driver fails. This allows for a more stable and reliable operating environment.
<P>
<LI>Dynamic hardware and environment configuration, which reduces the need for users to manually adjust and restart their computers.

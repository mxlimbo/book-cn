The following scenarios are commonly reported problems you might encounter with long file names and aliases:

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Long file names are not available when booting to a command prompt.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Protected mode file system drivers provide support for LFNs . These drivers do not load when booting to a command prompt, so LFNs are unavailable. LFNs are available, however, from an MS-DOS prompt within Windows&#160;98.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">MS-DOS names for long file names are deleted.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">The alias structure uses the same field entries as typical MS-DOS file names with the exception of previously reserved fields now used to maintain the creation time, creation date, and last access date. Some MS-DOS utilities do not expect to see any value in these fields and mistakenly attempt to repair the entries, destroying them instead. Use a Windows&#160;98 disk utility in place of the MS-DOS utility.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">MS-DOS names for long file names are changed.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Operations such as copy, edit, backup, and restore might change the alias associated with a file. For example, if a file with the name LongFileName is associated with an alias Longfi~2, and this file is copied to a different directory using 
<P>copy &quot;\LongFileName&quot;  &quot;\TMP\LongFileName&quot; 
<P>then the alias associated with this file can become Longfi~1, if such a basis name is not present in the target directory. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Long file names are destroyed</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Operations such as copy, edit, and backup destroy the long filename of the file operated upon, if the operation is performed on the alias rather than the long file name. For example, if the following command is performed on a file called LongFileName.txt with an alias of Longfi~1.txt, the long file name will be changed to the alias: 
<P>copy longfi~1.txt \tmp\longfi~1.txt</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Cannot create any more files or folders in root folder of a partition, even though plenty of disk space remains.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">With 8.3 filenames, the maximum number of directory entries in the root folder of a FAT16 partition is 512. Using long file names depletes directory entries at a faster rate, so it is recommended to be conservative with LFNs in the root folder. There is no limit on the number of directory entries in a subfolder of a FAT16 partition. The root folder of a FAT32 partition is limited to 65,535 entries.</TD>

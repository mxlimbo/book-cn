You can also enable user profiles by double-clicking the Users icon in Control Panel. There are several advantages to using this icon to manage profiles:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can create user profiles, including user names and passwords, without logging on as each user.
<P>
<LI>The Add User Wizard provides more options than those that are available with the Passwords icon.
<P>
<LI>You can configure settings for each user rather than for all profiles.
</UL>
<P>
After you enable user profiles, double-clicking the Users icon in Control Panel opens the User Settings property sheet (see Figure 15.3) and displays the User List of all user profiles available on the local computer.

<P>
You can modify an existing user profile or create a new user profile. Select the items you want to add to the profile from the following list:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Desktop folder and Documents menu
<P>
<LI>Start menu
<P>
<LI>Favorites folder
<P>
<LI>Downloaded Web pages
<P>
<LI>My Documents folder
</UL>
<P>
After you select the items from the list, choose between two options for creating the profile folders:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create copies of the current items and their content.
<P>
Copies the default user folders and their contents for the selected items to the newly created profile.
<P>
<LI>Create new items to save disk space.
<P>
Creates empty folders for the selected items. Contents are added when the new user logs on and chooses the desired settings.

<LI>	Your network consists of Windows&#160;98-based clients and Windows&#160;NT Server-based servers. Users typically log on to the network on their own computers, but occasionally on other computers as well. You want to implement roaming profiles on your Windows&#160;98-based network clients so that your users can download their desktop settings to any computer. However, your supervisor questions the possibility of many support calls from users who lose their desktop shortcuts and settings if the Windows&#160;NT-based profile server is unavailable. How would you explain the effects of an unavailable server on roaming profiles?

<LI>	You are troubleshooting a problem with a user's roaming profile. The configuration settings and changes save and load successfully when she logs on to her own computer. They also save and load successfully when she logs on to someone else's computer. When she returns to her own computer, however, the changes she made at the other computer are not present in her user profile. What might be the problem?

<LI>	Your users are able to download their desktop shortcuts from the NetWare server that contains their profile, but not their Start menu shortcuts. You verify that the computers running Windows&#160;98 are configured correctly. What is causing the problem, and how can you solve it?

<LI>	You receive a Help call from a user who states that his user profile is not working correctly. While most settings seem to follow him from one computer to another, the custom wallpaper he downloaded from the Internet only appears on his own computer. What is causing this problem?

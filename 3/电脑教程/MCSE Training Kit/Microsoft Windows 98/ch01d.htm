There are three common Windows operating systems utilized in organizations today: Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>, Windows&#160;95, and Windows&#160;NT.
<P>
Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I> (including Windows for Workgroups) is a 16-bit operating system that requires Microsoft DOS (Disk Operating System). Windows&#160;95 was released in order to add the functionality of a 32-bit operating system, and to dramatically enhance the user interface. One of the key features of Windows&#160;95 is backwards-compatibility with Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>.
<P>
Windows&#160;NT is a true 32-bit operating system with a completely different architecture to that of Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I> and Windows&#160;95. Windows&#160;NT is an operating system for users who need stability, security, and the ability to utilize various types of processors such as Alpha, MIPS, and Pentium. However, Windows&#160;NT does <I>not</I> provide complete backwards-compatibility with 16-bit programs.
<P>
Windows&#160;98, the newest Windows operating system, provides an upgraded feature set to Windows&#160;95. It is fully compatible with 16-bit programs, and, as such, is an alternative to Windows&#160;NT as a 32-bit operating system.

A setup script is a text file that contains settings for all of the options specified during Setup. You can use a setup script to create an automated installation template for installing Windows&#160;98 on multiple computers.
<P>
You can create a setup script by performing Setup on a newly formatted hard disk and copying sections from the Setuplog.txt file, located in the root directory of the C drive. Or, you can edit an existing setup script.

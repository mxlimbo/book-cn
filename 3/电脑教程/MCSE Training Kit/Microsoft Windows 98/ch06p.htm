Computer operation can be especially challenging for users with vision, hearing, or other physical disabilities. Support personnel should be familiar with system settings that provide better access for users with special needs.
<P>
The <B>Accessibility Options</B> icon in Control Panel is one method for customizing some sound, keyboard, mouse, and display settings. Use this method if you are familiar with the available options.

Microsoft Magnifier is a display utility that makes the screen more easily readable for users with vision limitations. The magnifier creates a separate window that displays a magnified image of a portion of your screen. Each user can move and size this window to individual preferences.
<P>
Microsoft Magnifier is located in the <B>Start</B> menu (Programs, Accessories, Accessibility), and can also be started through the Accessibility  Wizard (see Figure 6.8).

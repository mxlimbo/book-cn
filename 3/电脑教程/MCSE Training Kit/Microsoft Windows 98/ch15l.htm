You enable user profiles either with the Passwords icon or the Users icon. There are several advantages to using the latter method, such as the ability to create user profiles without logging on under each user's name, the number of options available through the Add User Wizard, and the ability to determine settings for each user name, rather than for all user profiles. To disable user profiles, use the Passwords icon in the Control Panel.

<A NAME="593"><H2>Enabling User-Level Security</H2></A><P>
Although you can use share-level access control to protect resources on your computer running Windows&#160;98, anyone who discovers the password to a resource can gain access to it. If you are on a Windows&#160;NT network, you can apply tighter security by using user-level access control, which requires a valid user name and user account password in order to access resources.
<P>
<A NAME="594"><H3>Choosing a Security Provider for User-Level Access Control</H3></A><P>
When applying user-level access control to a Windows&#160;NT network, you must choose a <I>security provider</I> from among the domains and computers in your network (see Figure 13.8). The security provider is a Windows&#160;NT domain server or a Windows&#160;NT workgroup computer that maintains the list of users and groups to which you may assign resource permissions. When a remote user attempts to gain access to a resource on your computer, your security provider validates the user's user name and password.

<P>
You may choose only one security provider for a computer running Windows&#160;98. This single security provider authenticates all shared resources on the computer running Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<A NAME="595"><H3>Pass-through Authentication</H3></A><P>
When a Windows&#160;98 server is employing user-level security, the server follows a four-step process to pass an authentication request through the network to its security provider:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	A remote user attempts to connect to the Windows&#160;98 server's user-level security share, passing the remote user's user name and password.
<P>
<LI>	The Windows&#160;98 user-level security server asks the Windows&#160;NT PDC security provider to verify the user name and password of the remote user.
<P>
<LI>	The security provider checks for the remote user's user name and password in its directory database and informs the Windows&#160;98 server if the information is valid.
<P>
<LI>	The Windows&#160;98 user-level security server grants the specified access to the remote user.
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Important</B>
<P>
A security provider must be present in order for a remote user to gain access to a computer running Windows&#160;98 that is employing user-level access control. If a security provider is unavailable, remote users cannot have access to resources on the computer running Windows&#160;98.

<HR>
<P>
If you want to enable user-level access control, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open <B>Control Panel</B> and double-click the <B>Network</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>User-level access control</B> and enter the name of your security provider in the <B>Obtain list of users and groups from</B> list.
<P>
<LI>	Restart your computer in order for these settings to take effect.
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
You cannot use both share-level and user-level security on the same computer.

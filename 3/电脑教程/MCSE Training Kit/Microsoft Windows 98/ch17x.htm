Using the security levels and zones within Internet Explorer 4.0, you can control access to the Internet. You can configure rating levels for each of four categories: language, nudity, sex and violence. The rating information is stored in the C:\Windows\System folder and cannot be viewed or edited. Zones group sites with the same security level, and Internet Explorer will notify you of potential security problems related to the site based on the security level for the zone.
<P>
Network administrators can use proxies and firewalls to regulate a Web site's traffic. A proxy server acts as a secure gateway to the Internet for a network or group of computers. Firewalls are routers that filter traffic and perform security auditing.
<P>
You can configure Internet Explorer to run in kiosk mode, in which a publicly available workstation is dedicated for Internet access.

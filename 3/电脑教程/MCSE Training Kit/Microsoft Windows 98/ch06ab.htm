<A NAME="250"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="251"><H3>Configuring Hardware Settings</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Control Panel is a folder containing icons with which you open property sheets to customize the computer's configuration.
<P>
<LI>Use Control Panel to access the Add New Hardware Wizard, which allows you to install hardware devices that are not Plug and Play compatible.
<P>
<LI>Use Control Panel to access the <B>System</B> icon, which allows you to create and modify hardware profiles.
<P>
<LI>Use Control Panel to access the <B>Display</B> icon, which provides options for configuring screen resolution, color depth, appearance settings, and screen savers.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="252"><H3>Configuring System Settings</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>With virtual memory, Windows&#160;98 keeps some information in RAM while it swaps, or temporarily moves, other information to a virtual memory swap file. Configure virtual memory with the Virtual Memory dialog box.
<P>
<LI>Use the File Systems Properties sheet to set the hard disk cache and the CD-ROM File System cache, and to configure floppy and removable disk drives.
<P>
<LI>Use the <B>Accessibility Options</B> icon in Control Panel to configure the computer for users with vision, hearing, and mobility needs.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="253"><H3>Creating the Software Environment</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the Add/Remove Programs Properties sheet to install and remove components and applications.
<P>
<LI>When you remove programs with <B>Add/Remove</B>, their entries in the registry are marked as deleted. Once a day upon startup, Microsoft Registry Checker scans and backs up the registry. If Registry Checker contains 500K or more of keys marked as deleted, it will optimize the registry the next time you start your computer.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="254"><H3>Using the Registry to Configure Windows&#160;98 Settings</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The registry is a database used for storing software and hardware configuration settings. Windows&#160;98 creates the registry during Setup and updates it when changes are made to hardware or software configuration.
<P>
<LI>The components of the registry consist of subtrees (analogous to the root folder of a disk), keys and subkeys (analogous to folders), and values (analogous to files).
<P>
<LI>To alter a registry value, you can use the Registry Editor, although Microsoft does not recommend or support making changes directly to the registry when an alternative exists.

<A NAME="383"><H1>Lesson 2: Performing Maintenance Tasks</H1></A><P>
Regular maintenance of your computer system improves performance and increases efficiency. This lesson discusses several tools provided by Windows&#160;98 to make accomplishing and scheduling your maintenance tasks easier.
<P>
Both the Windows-based and MS-DOS based versions of ScanDisk have been upgraded to provide disk-checking and repair capability for both FAT16 and FAT32 file systems. Disk Defragmenter now includes an application optimization option that decreases the time it takes to start a program. The Disk Cleanup wizard, a new tool in Windows&#160;98, removes temporary and unneeded files.
<P>
The Maintenance Wizard is also a new tool, and it provides a quick and simple method for running ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup unattended on a regular schedule. Using the Scheduled Tasks wizard, you can schedule any application to run at a specific time.

<A NAME="490"><H1>Lesson 2: Automating a Multiple Installation Setup</H1></A><P>
This lesson presents techniques for automating multiple installations of Windows&#160;98. Automating the installation is a key step in reducing installation time and costs. If you create a setup script with predetermined answers for installation questions, the installation process can run from start to finish with minimal user input. This method works for CD-ROM installations, push installations, and pull installations. One advantage of a setup script is being able to include additional components that you want to install during setup. Windows&#160;98 includes INF Installer (infinst.exe) to make it easy for you to select and add components to the automated installation script.

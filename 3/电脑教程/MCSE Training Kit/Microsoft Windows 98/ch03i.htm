<A NAME="135"><H1>Lesson 2: Choosing a File System in Windows&#160;98</H1></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 supports FAT32 and FAT16 file systems. FAT32 can create partitions larger than the 2 gigabyte (GB) limit of FAT16, and uses smaller clusters than FAT16, resulting in more efficient use of space on large hard disks.
<P>
This lesson compares the FAT16 and FAT32 file systems. It also describes the procedures for setting up a FAT32 partition, as well as for converting a FAT16 partition to a FAT32 partition.

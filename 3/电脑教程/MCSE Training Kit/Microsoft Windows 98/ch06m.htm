The disk cache in Windows&#160;98 is dynamic and requires no additional configuration. However, you can use the File System Properties sheet (see Figure 6.5) to guide Windows&#160;98 in optimizing the disk cache for your specific type of computer.

If you want to configure the hard disk cache:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	From the <B>System</B> icon in Control Panel, click the <B>Performance</B> tab, and then click <B>File System.</B>
<P>
<LI>	 Select a configuration based on the typical role of the computer:
<P>
<UL><B><LI>Desktop computer.</B> A normal computer acting primarily as a network client or a stand-alone computer, that has more than the minimum required RAM and is running on power, rather than battery.
<P>
<B><LI>Mobile or docking system.</B> Any computer with limited memory. Select this configuration for a computer that has limited RAM and is running on battery, so the disk cache will be cleared frequently.
<P>
<B><LI>Network server.</B> A computer used primarily as a peer server for file or printer sharing, with adequate RAM and frequent disk activity. This selection optimizes the computer settings for a high amount of disk access.
</UL>
</OL>
The <B>Read-ahead optimization</B> setting, also configurable on this screen, sets the amount of RAM used for read-ahead optimization and controls how much extra data is read during normal file requests.

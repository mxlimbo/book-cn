<A NAME="213"><H2>Multiple Display Hardware Requirements</H2></A><P>
When configuring your Windows&#160;98 computer for multiple displays, you must check that all display adapters meet specific hardware requirements. All of the display adapters used with multiple displays must be Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) devices. However, the hardware requirements for the two types of displays differ. A display adapter that functions as a primary display may not always work as a secondary device.
<P>
Most PCI and AGP display adapters that have appropriate Windows&#160;98 compliant video drivers can function as the primary display. The secondary display and all additional display adapters must meet Windows&#160;98 hardware requirements for secondary display adapters.

The Windows&#160;98 Release Notes include additional information about multiple display hardware requirements.

<A NAME="214"><H3>Identifying the Primary Display</H3></A><P>
After installing a secondary display adapter, you can identify the primary display monitor by restarting the computer. After restart, the primary display shows the Power On Self Test (POST) information, and the secondary display remains black. As Windows&#160;98 starts, a message appears on the secondary display indicating that this display adapter has initialized. You can also double-click the Display icon in Control Panel and select the Settings tab to show a numbered frame for each installed monitor. If you click and hold on frame 1, the primary monitor will respond with a number &quot;1&quot; on its screen.
<P>
The system BIOS picks the primary VGA device based on the PCI slot order&#151;unless the BIOS offers an option for picking which device is to be treated as the VGA device. The VGA device cannot be stopped, which is an important consideration for docking units. When &quot;hot docked&quot; into a docking station that contains a display adapter, some laptops will disable their built-in display. Multiple display support will not function on these configurations unless multiple adapters are attached to the docking station.
<P>
There are two additional considerations if one of the adapters is built into the motherboard:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	The on-board adapter becomes the secondary adapter. It must be multiple-display compatible.
<P>
<LI>	You must completely set up Windows&#160;98 before installing the add-in adapter. Windows&#160;98 Setup will disable the on-board adapter during setup if another adapter is detected.
</OL>

<P>
Some systems will completely disable the on-board adapter if an add-in adapter is detected during start up. If you cannot turn off this behavior in the BIOS, you cannot use the on-board adapter with multiple display.

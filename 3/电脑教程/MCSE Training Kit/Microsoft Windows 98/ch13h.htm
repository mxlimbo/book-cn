<A NAME="579"><H2>Identifying a Domain</H2></A><P>
In Windows&#160;NT, a <I>domain</I> is a grouping of computers running Windows&#160;NT that share a common directory database of user accounts and policies (see Figure 13.3).

<P>
As in a workgroup, all of the computers in a domain are displayed together in the domain's Network Neighborhood. Administering a domain differs from administering a workgroup, however. In a workgroup each computer running Windows&#160;98 is responsible for its own security and administration; in a domain, one computer running Windows&#160;NT Server acts as the domain controller, which sets the security and administration policies for all other computers in the domain.
<P>
<A NAME="580"><H3>Domain Controllers</H3></A><P>
The <I>primary domain controller</I> (PDC) of a domain is the Windows&#160;NT Server that contains the master directory database. Every domain must have a primary domain controller. In addition, the domain may have one or more <I>backup domain controllers </I>(BDCs), which contain replicated copies of the directory database. Other Windows&#160;NT workstations and servers can join the domain to use domain security to protect their resources. When you log on as a domain member and/or request access to a resource on a domain member, the PDC or a BDC authenticates the logon request.
<P>
<A NAME="581"><H4>Windows&#160;98 and Domains</H4></A><P>
Computers running Windows&#160;98 cannot join a domain, because they cannot establish the necessary computer and domain accounts needed for a domain. When a user logs on using a computer running Windows&#160;98, a domain controller can authenticate the user so the user can gain access to resources on domain computers.

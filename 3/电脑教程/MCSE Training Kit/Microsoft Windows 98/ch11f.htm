<A NAME="485"><H2>Choosing a Multiple Installation Method</H2></A><P>
Three common methods for performing a multiple installation of Windows&#160;98 on a network include CD-ROM installation, push<I> </I>installation, and pull<I> </I>installation. The method you choose will depend on your network environment.
<P>
<A NAME="486"><H3>Installing Windows&#160;98 from CD-ROM</H3></A><P>
If you are installing Windows&#160;98 on fewer than five computers, or if a computer's configuration varies considerably from the standard Setup in a department, then you should install from CD-ROM.
<P>
Installing from a CD-ROM is quick and convenient for one computer, and often the computer user can perform the installation. However, each installation requires that you use the CD-ROM, so installations depend on the availability of the CD-ROM. If a user has difficulty with the installation, you must provide individual assistance. 
<P>
<A NAME="487"><H3>Using Push Installations for Windows&#160;98 Setup</H3></A><P>
If you are installing Windows&#160;98 more than five times, a push installation can make the installation process easier. A push installation sends an automated setup of Windows&#160;98 from a network server to the client workstation. The network administrator initiates the push installation, which is forced on the target computers. Windows&#160;98 does not include a push installation tool; however Microsoft System Management Server, a BackOffice product that runs on Windows&#160;NT Server, can perform push installations of Windows&#160;98.
<P>
Push installations reduce the interaction between the user and the installation process, enforce corporate configuration standards, and reduce ongoing support and migration costs. When you push the installation from the server you can install Windows&#160;98 on an individual computer or group of computers without ever touching them. You also can install Windows&#160;98 on a computer that does not have a CD-ROM drive. 
<P>
A push installation can take longer than a CD-ROM installation for a single computer, since the files must be sent over the network and may encounter heavy network traffic.
<P>
<A NAME="488"><H3>Using Pull Installations for Windows&#160;98 Setup</H3></A><P>
If you must install Windows&#160;98 more than five times, a pull installation can also make the process easier. In a pull installation, users request setup data from the server. You can copy the Windows&#160;98 source files to a server, and allow users to have access to the files to download them. You can also use a batch file to automate the pull installation from the server. Multiple users can perform pull installations at the same time.
<P>
Using the pull installation method, users can install the new operating system at their convenience. They can also use this method to install Windows&#160;98 on a computer that does not have a CD-ROM drive. However, you have less control over this type of installation than you do over a push installation.
<P>
When using a batch script for a pull installation from a server, you must create a shared directory that will contain the batch file on the server and copy the Windows&#160;98 source files to that shared directory.

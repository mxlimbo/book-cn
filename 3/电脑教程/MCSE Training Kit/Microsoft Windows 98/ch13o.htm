From a computer running Windows&#160;98, you can print to a Windows&#160;NT-based print server the same way you print to a Windows&#160;98-based print server. However, you must have Windows&#160;98 compatible printer drivers (see Figure 13.7).

<P>
Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT do not share printer drivers. However, if the print server is running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 or later, your computer will be able to obtain its printer driver from the print server transparently. Your computer will then configure itself automatically if the Windows&#160;98 printer drivers have been installed on the server. If the drivers have not been installed on the server, you will be prompted for a manufacturer and model; you must supply that information and the Windows&#160;98 source files or third party driver disk.
<P>
If the Windows&#160;98 printer driver has been updated on the print server, you must remove and reinstall the printer icon from your Printers folder to obtain the new printer driver.

You can administer a remote Windows&#160;NT printer the same way you administer a remote Windows&#160;98 printer; however, depending on the permissions assigned to the Windows&#160;NT printer, some commands may not be available.

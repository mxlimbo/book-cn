<A NAME="661"><H1>Lesson 1: Identifying a User Profile</H1></A><P>
This lesson discusses user profiles. A user profile contains configuration settings that establish the user's environment when the user logs on to a computer. User profiles can store such things as desktop shortcuts, favorite Web sites, and contents of the My Documents folder. Windows&#160;98 supports multiple user and multiple computer settings through the implementation of user profiles.
<P>
In many organizations, multiple users may share a single computer, such as when different shifts work in the same office. In this situation, it is useful to have separate configuration profiles stored locally for each user who logs on to the computer.
<P>
In other instances, one person may use several different computers, for example, when a staff member works at different stations in an office. In this situation, it is useful to have separate configuration profiles for each user on a network server so that any connected workstation can download the user profile.
<P>
This lesson discusses user profile contents. It addresses the different kinds of user profiles and presents information to help you decide when it is appropriate to use them.

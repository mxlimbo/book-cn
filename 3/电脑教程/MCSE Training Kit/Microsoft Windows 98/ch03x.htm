Here are some recommendations for configuring and managing hard disks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In MS-DOS mode or Windows&#160;98 safe mode, load SmartDrv.exe in the Autoexec.bat file to accelerate hard disk access speeds.
<P>
<LI>Create several Windows&#160;98 emergency startup disks (ESDs), especially if you have converted to FAT32. Only Windows&#160;98 ESDs work with FAT32 partitions.
<P>
<LI>Publish a naming convention for your site so that users are aware of naming considerations and to prevent problems with long file names.
<P>
<LI>Either compression or conversion to FAT32 can increase hard disk capacity, but each is used in different circumstances.
<P>
<UL><LI>Consider compression if you have limited disk space.
<P>
<LI>Consider conversion to FAT32 if you have a large hard disk.

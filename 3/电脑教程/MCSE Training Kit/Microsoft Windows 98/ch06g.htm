<A NAME="261"><H2>Creating Hardware Profiles</H2></A><P>
A <I>hardware profile</I> is a record of a specific configuration of hardware in the computer. Mobile users need flexible hardware configurations. Users plug their portable computers into docking stations in the office and use them in undocked states away from the office. The docking stations may include additional hardware, such as CD-ROM devices or network adapters. The undocked computers might use external modems, rather than network adapters.
<P>
To address this issue and other situations when you need to establish several hardware configurations for a single computer, Windows&#160;98 uses hardware profiles to determine which drivers to load when the system hardware changes.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 automatically creates one profile for a portable computer in a docking station and a second profile for its undocked state. Windows&#160;98 detects the status of the computer&#151;docked or undocked&#151;during startup and configures to the corresponding profile.
<P>
<A NAME="262"><H3>Creating Hardware Profiles Manually</H3></A><P>
You can create and modify hardware profiles through the System icon in Control Panel. The <B>Hardware Profiles</B> tab lists all profiles that have been created, including the profile for Original Configuration which updates automatically to reflect all hardware additions, removals, and changes.
<P>
If you want to create a new profile:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Select <B>Original Configuration</B>, click the <B>Copy</B> button, and then give it a new name.
<P>
After you create a new profile, you change it to establish the desired configuration for this profile. You must restart the computer with the new hardware profile to have the changes implemented. When you restart the computer, Windows&#160;98 prompts you to select a hardware profile to load.
</OL>
<P>
If you want to configure a new profile:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Restart the computer with the new profile, and then double-click the <B>System</B> icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>System Properties</B> window, click the <B>Device Manager</B> tab to view all installed hardware devices.
<P>
<LI>	Select the device you want to disable or remove from this profile and click <B>Properties</B>. The <B>General</B> tab of the device properties window offers two profile options:
<P>
<UL><B><LI>Disable in this hardware profile</B> prevents the drivers for that device from being loaded during startup.
<P>
<B><LI>Remove from this hardware profile</B> removes the device and its drivers from the configuration in the profile and can only be reversed by reinstalling the drivers.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>	Select the desired profile option and click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each device that you want to change in this profile.
</OL>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
If you disable Plug and Play devices, the resources (such as IRQ and DMA) for those devices are available for other devices automatically. If you disable a legacy device, however, you must also remove the device from the hardware list in <B>Device Manager</B> and physically remove the hardware from your computer in order to free those resources for other devices.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
You should use hardware profiles only to indicate different hardware configurations. Identical profiles slow the startup process because Windows&#160;98 startup cannot determine which of two identical profiles to use, and will force you to select a profile to load.

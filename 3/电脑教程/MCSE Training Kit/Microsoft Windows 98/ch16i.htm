System policies are collections of registry settings that overwrite current user and local machine areas of the registry. With system policies, you can restrict what users can do from the desktop, restrict access to Control Panel options, customize parts of the desktop, and configure network settings.
<P>
When the user logs on, Windows&#160;98 checks the user's configuration information for the location of the policy file.
<P>
Both System Policy Editor and Registry Editor allow you to gain access to a remote computer's registry. System Policy Editor provides access to a subset of keys, while Registry Editor provides access to the entire registry.
<P>
System policies can establish user-specific and computer-specific settings. Mandatory user profiles can establish only user-specific settings.
<P>
In order to implement system policies, you will need to plan your approach, install your tools, create a policy file, and load the policy file in the proper location.

Setup checks for anti-virus software, and, if any is found, displays a message prompting you to disable it. Setup then creates Setuplog.txt, which records information about the setup process as it occurs, in the root directory of drive C.
<P>
After you click <B>Continue</B>, Setup creates a temporary directory named C:\Wininst0.400. Setup expands and copies the files that are required to run the Setup Wizard from Precopy1.cab, Precopy2.cab, and Precopy 3.cab into C:\Wininst0.400.

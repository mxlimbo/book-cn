If you encounter problems using multiple displays, use the following troubleshooting guidelines to aid in resolving those problems.
<P>
If you can't see any output on the secondary display:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Confirm that the device has been activated through Display Properties.
<P>
<LI>Confirm that the correct video driver is selected for the secondary adapter.
<P>
<LI>Confirm that the secondary display has been initialized during restart. If not, check device manager for the status of the video adapter.
<P>
<LI>Physically switch the order of the adapters in the PCI slots (this requires the primary display to also qualify as a secondary display).
</UL>
<P>
If the &quot;Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor&quot; option is disabled, confirm the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The secondary display is highlighted in Display Properties.
<P>
<LI>The secondary display adapter is supported.
<P>
<LI>The secondary display has been detected.
</UL>
<P>
If you have problems running a program using multiple displays:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Run the program on the primary display.
<P>
<LI>Run the program full screen (MS-DOS) or maximized (Windows).
<P>
<LI>Disable the secondary display to see if the issue is specific to Multiple Display.

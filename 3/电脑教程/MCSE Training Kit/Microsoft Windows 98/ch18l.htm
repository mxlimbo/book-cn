If you want to create a new dial-up networking connection, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>My Computer</B>, double-click the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> folder.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Make New Connection</B> icon. The Make New Connection Wizard appears (see Figure 18.6) and prompts you for the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A name for the connection
<P>
<LI>A modem with which to connect
<P>
<LI>The phone number to dial
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
After configuring the new connection, you can start it by double-clicking the connection icon in the Dial-Up Networking folder.
<P>
<A NAME="811"><H3>Using AutoDial</H3></A><P>
Dial-Up Networking also provides an AutoDial feature. If AutoDial is enabled, Windows&#160;98 starts Dial-Up Networking when you attempt to connect to a network resource that is not available on the physical network. A message appears, asking if you would like to use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the resource. Some examples of actions that start an AutoDial connection include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Trying to use a persistent mapped network drive connection.
<P>
<LI>Double-clicking a shortcut to a remote file or printer.
</UL>
<P>
In the Dial-Up Networking folder, you can disable the prompt that asks you if you want to use Dial-Up Networking when you are attempting to connect to a network resource.
<P>
If you want to disable the AutoDial prompt, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open the Dial-Up Networking folder.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Connections </B>menu, click <B>Settings</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>General</B> tab, select <B>Don't prompt to use Dial-Up Networking</B>.
</OL>

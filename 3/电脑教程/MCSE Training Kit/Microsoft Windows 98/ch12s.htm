<A NAME="555"><H2>Sharing Printers</H2></A><P>
When you share a printer using share-level access control, you can assign a password to protect it from unauthorized use. Anyone with the password can send documents to the shared printer. There is only one level of access to a remote printer.
<P>
<A NAME="556"><H3>Configuring a Shared Printer</H3></A><P>
When you configure a local printer as a shared printer, other users have access to the printer. If you want to configure a shared printer, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>My Computer</B>, double-click the <B>Printers</B> folder.
<P>
<LI>	Right-click on the printer you want to share.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Sharing</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Sharing</B> tab, click <B>Shared As </B>and enter a share name for the printer.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="557"><H3>Connecting to a Shared Printer</H3></A><P>
When you share a printer, you also share your C:\Windows\system folder, with the hidden share name <B>printer$</B>. When remote Windows&#160;clients connect to your shared printer, your printer drivers and supporting files are copied from your printer$ shared folder to the remote client's C:\Windows\system folder. The remote client does not have to provide the drivers manually. This is called Point and Print installation.
<P>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
A Windows&#160;98 client will not query the print server for a new driver each time the client prints. In order to receive an updated print driver from the print server, delete the shortcut to the remote printer and add it again.

<A NAME="367"><H2>Troubleshooting Printing Problems</H2></A><P>
If you are having printing problems, check the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Verify that the printer is turned on and is online, that it has paper and toner/ribbon/ink cartridge, and that any other physical requirements have been met.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the correct printer is selected for printing, and that it has not been paused or configured to work offline.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the correct printer driver is installed for the selected printer.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the correct settings are configured for the printer driver. If you suspect that the printer driver settings were changed from the default settings, click the Restore  Default button on the appropriate tab.
<P>
<LI>If the spool data format is EMF, change it to raw.
<P>
<LI>If the problem is specific to an MS-DOS-based application, disable spooling for that printer. If this works, spooling may not be possible with this program.
<P>
<LI>Determine whether the problem is application-specific or global to Windows&#160;98 by printing from another application. If the problem is application-specific, seek support from the application vendor. If global, seek support from Microsoft.
<P>
<LI>Contact your printer vendor to see if there is a more recent printer driver than the one you are using. If so, update the driver. These drivers are usually available on the Internet at the vendor's web site.

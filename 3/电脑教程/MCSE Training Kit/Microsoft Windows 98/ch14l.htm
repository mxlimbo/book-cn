To log on to a NetWare server, you must first install and configure the necessary software. Internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX) is the primary protocol used by Novell NetWare networks. To log on to a NetWare network, you must install and configure IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol. You must also install and configure Client for NetWare Network.
<P>
If your network includes NetWare 4.<i>x</i> servers running NetWare Directory Services (NDS), you must install Service for NetWare Directory Services, which requires IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol and Client for NetWare Networks. If you do not install those components separately, Windows&#160;98 installs them automatically with Service for NetWare Directory Services.
<P>
To configure logon functions, you must choose which network will validate your logon. Some functions, such as the primary network logon and enabling logon script processing, can be set from a computer running Windows&#160;98. You can change passwords only from a NetWare server.

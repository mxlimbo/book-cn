<A NAME="384"><H2>Using ScanDisk</H2></A><P>
ScanDisk is a full-featured disk analysis and repair program. ScanDisk in Windows&#160;98 is upgraded to recognize and fix issues with FAT32 drives and compressed drives. ScanDisk runs as part of Windows&#160;98 Setup. You can also run ScanDisk manually at any time after Windows&#160;98 Setup. ScanDisk runs automatically after an improper shutdown unless it is disabled through Msdos.sys. You can do this by setting the AutoScan value to zero.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 provides two versions of ScanDisk: a graphical Windows-based version (Scandskw.exe) and an MS-DOS-based version that is contained in the Windows\Command folder (Scandisk.exe).
<P>
ScanDisk checks and fixes problems in the following areas on hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, RAM drives, and memory cards: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>FAT16 partitions, and FAT32 partitions up to 127.53 GB
<P>
<LI>Long file names
<P>
<LI>File system structure, such as lost clusters, cross-linked files, invalid file names and dates
<P>
<LI>Directory tree structure 
<P>
<LI>Physical surface of the drive (marks bad sectors so that they will not be used. Moves data stored in a bad cluster if possible) 
<P>
<LI>DriveSpace 3 or DoubleSpace volumes 
</UL>
<P>
ScanDisk cannot find or fix errors on CD-ROM drives, network drives, or drives created by using <B>assign</B>, <B>subst</B>, <B>join</B>, or <B>interlnk</B>.
<P>
If you want to run ScanDisk, click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, <B>Accessories</B>, <B>System Tools</B>, and then click <B>ScanDisk</B>. The opening window of ScanDisk will list disk drives to scan on your computer, and the types of tests to perform on these drives.
<P>
You can run a <I>Standard</I> or a <I>Thorough</I> test with ScanDisk.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Standard</I> <I>test </I>checks files and folders for errors.
<P>
<LI><I>Thorough  test </I>performs the Standard test and checks the surface of the hard disk for errors. The Thorough test has the following options for <B>Areas of the disk to scan</B>:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>System and data areas
<P>
<LI>System area only
<P>
<LI>Data area only
</UL>
<P>
Your other Thorough test options are:
<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Do not perform write-testing.</B> With write-testing, ScanDisk reads the contents of each sector on the hard disk, then writes the contents back to verify that the disk can be read from and written to correctly.
<P>
<B><LI>Do not repair bad sectors in hidden and system files.</B> ScanDisk repairs bad sectors by moving the data they contain to a valid location. If you select this option, ScanDisk does not move data that is part of a hidden or system file, some of which are position-dependent.

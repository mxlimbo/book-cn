<A NAME="199"><H2>USB Topology</H2></A><P>
USB uses a tiered topology (see Figure 4.3) that allows up to 127 devices to be attached to the bus simultaneously. Each device can be up to five meters from a hub. USB currently supports up to five tiers.

The three types of USB components include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>USB host
<P>
The host, either built into the motherboard or installed as an adapter card in the computer, controls all traffic on the bus and also functions as a hub.
<P>
<LI>USB hub
<P>
The hub provides a point to attach devices to the bus. Hubs are also responsible for detecting devices that are being attached or detached from the bus, and for providing power management services for devices that are attached to the hub. Hubs are either bus-powered&#151;meaning that they draw power directly from the bus&#151;or externally powered. You cannot connect a bus-powered hub to another bus-powered hub, and you cannot connect devices that draw more than 100 milliamps of power to a bus-powered hub.
<P>
<LI>USB device
<P>
These are the I/O devices that are attached to the bus. USB devices have a single connector type, which means any device can be used in any port. USB devices may also function as hubs. For example, a USB monitor may have ports for attaching a USB keyboard and mouse. In this case, the monitor would be both a USB device as well as a USB hub. USB devices can draw their power either from the bus or from an external source.

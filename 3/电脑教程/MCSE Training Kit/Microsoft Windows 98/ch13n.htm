A computer running Windows&#160;98 can connect to a computer running Windows&#160;NT (see Figure 13.6) and use its file and print resources. You can connect to a Windows&#160;NT computer either in a domain or in a workgroup.

<P>
To connect to a computer running Windows&#160;NT in a domain, you must log on to the domain with a valid domain user account and password. In addition, your account must have access rights to the computer running Windows&#160;NT. To have access to a specific resource in the domain, you must have an account that has permissions to access that resource.

<P>
You can have access only to computers that recognize the user name and password you use to log on to the network. Unlike Windows&#160;NT, Windows&#160;98 does not have a Connect As feature you can use to specify a different user name and password for the remote server.

<P>
If you want access to a computer running Windows&#160;NT in a workgroup, then you must enter a valid user name and password for the remote computer when you log on to your local Windows&#160;98 computer. In other words, you must log on to your local computer with the same user name and password that exists on the Windows&#160;NT workgroup computer's Access Control List.

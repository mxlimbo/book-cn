To use Windows&#160;98 networking features, you must first give your computer a unique name that other computers on the network will recognize. You then install the hardware and software that enables your computer to connect to the network, and configure the protocol that your computer uses to communicate with other computers on the network.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports a wide range of network types including Ethernet, Token Ring, and Attached Resource Computer network (ArcNet). Network protocols supported by Windows&#160;98 include NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI), Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX), Microsoft Data-link Control (DLC), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and Fast Infrared Protocol.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 implementation of TCP/IP includes the standard suite of TCP/IP protocols, including Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

<A NAME="65"><H2>Procedure for Uninstalling Windows&#160;98</H2></A><P>
If you meet the uninstalling requirements, you can uninstall Windows&#160;98 and restore your Windows&#160;95 or MS-DOS operating system.
<P>
If you want to uninstall Windows&#160;98, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In Control Panel, click <B>Add/Remove Programs</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Install/Uninstall</B> tab, select <B>Uninstall Windows&#160;98</B>, and then click <B>Add/Remove</B>.
<P>
The <B>Windows&#160;98 Uninstall</B> dialog box appears, stating that you are about to remove Windows&#160;98 from your computer and restore Windows&#160;95.
<P>
Click <B>Yes</B> to continue with the uninstall procedure.
<P>
A dialog box appears informing you that your disk(s) will be checked for errors.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Yes</B>.
<P>
ScanDisk runs on all nonremovable hard disks, and another dialog box appears asking if you want to continue.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Yes</B>.
<P>
The computer restarts in MS-DOS mode and the Uninstal.exe program runs automatically. This program is located in the C:\Windows\Command directory. The MS-DOS program restores the Windows&#160;95 files and settings contained in Winundo.dat and then prompts you to restart the computer.
<P>
<LI>	Once the computer restarts, Windows&#160;95 will be restored and usable.
</OL>

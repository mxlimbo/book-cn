You create and delete partitions using the command-line utility Fdisk.exe (see Figure 3.1) located in the  C:\Windows\Command folder. Fdisk is also on the emergency startup disk you create with Windows&#160;98. You can use Fdisk to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Enable large disk (FAT32) support.
<P>
<LI>Create and delete primary and extended partitions.
<P>
<LI>Create and delete logical drives within an extended partition.
<P>
<LI>Designate an active partition.
</UL>

Actions performed using Fdisk are not reversible. If you repartition a hard disk with Fdisk, you delete all the files on the original partitions. Be sure to back up all data files on a partition before using Fdisk.

<P>
&#150; or &#150;
<P>
Start your computer with your emergency startup disk. At the command prompt, type <B>Fdisk</B>.
<P>
If your hard drive is 512 MB or larger, a screen appears, prompting you to enable large disk support. If you answer <B>Y</B>, any new partitions you create will be FAT32 partitions. If you answer <B>N</B>, any new partitions you create will be FAT16 partitions.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Fdisk Options</B> screen, press <B>1</B>, and then press ENTER. The <B>Create DOS Partition or Logical DOS Drive</B> screen appears. 
<P>
Partitions must be created in this order:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Primary partitions.
<P>
<LI>Extended partitions.
<P>
<LI>Logical DOS drive in an extended partition.
<P></UL>
<LI>	To specify the partition type and size you want, follow the instructions on-screen, and then press <B>ENTER</B>.
<P>
You specify the partition size as a percentage of disk space or in megabytes of disk space. If you specify a percentage of disk space, include a percent sign (%) after the number.

</OL>
<P>
You must delete partitions in this order:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Any non-DOS partitions.
<P>
<LI>	Any logical drives in extended partitions.
<P>
<LI>	Any extended partitions.
<P>

If you want to delete a partition, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In the <B>Fdisk Options</B> screen, press <B>3</B>, and then press <B>ENTER</B>. The<B> Delete DOS Partition Or Logical DOS Drive</B> screen appears.

If Fdisk cannot delete a non-MS-DOS partition, quit Fdisk, delete the non-MS-DOS partition by using the software used to create it, and then restart Fdisk.
<P>
Fdisk cannot delete NTFS logical drives created by Windows&#160;NT in an extended partition. Use a Windows&#160;NT-based utility to delete these drives.

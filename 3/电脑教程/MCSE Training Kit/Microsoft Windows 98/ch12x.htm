Here are some recommendations for installing and configuring Windows&#160;98 network components:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create workgroups based on people who frequently work together, so they can easily share resources in Network Neighborhood.
<P>
<LI>Create a logical, consistent naming scheme for computers to make them easily identifiable.
<P>
<LI>If you are using share-level security, stress the importance of passwords and security to your users. If you are using an NT or NetWare network, implement user-level security for more restricted access.
<P>
<LI>If you are using multiple adapters, protocols, or services, disable bindings for those components that do not need to work together in order to increase performance. For instance, you might unbind TCP/IP from Client for NetWare Networks.
<P>
<LI>Do not enable the Browse Master on every Windows&#160;98 computer. This can slow down network communications. Instead, configure one seldom used computer as the Browse Master and leave the setting as automatic on the other computers.

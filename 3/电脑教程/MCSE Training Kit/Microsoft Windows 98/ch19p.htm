<A NAME="853"><H2>Troubleshooting Remote Computers</H2></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 provides two utilities to diagnose and troubleshoot remote computers, Registry Editor and System Monitor. Registry Editor allows you to view and modify system settings in the Windows Registry. System Monitor is a performance monitoring tool that allows you to track memory and CPU usage, network I/O, and local processes and threads. To use the utilities, your computer and the remote computer must meet the following conditions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Both your computer and the remote computer must have user-level access control enabled.
<P>
<LI>Both computers must have the Remote Registry service installed.
<P>
<LI>The remote computer must have Remote Administration enabled.
<P>
<LI>You must have administrator privileges on the remote computer.
<P>
<LI>The remote computer must display your user name in the <B>Administrators</B> list box on the <B>Remote Administration</B> tab in the <B>Password Properties</B> sheet. If the remote computer has a Windows&#160;NT security provider, the Domain Admins global group is granted access by default. If the remote computer has a Novell NetWare security provider, the Supervisor account is granted access by default.

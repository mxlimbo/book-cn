System File Checker is a Windows&#160;98 utility that verifies the integrity of your operating system files and attempts to restore corrupted files by extracting them from your original Windows&#160;98 installation source.
<P>
Version Conflict Manager saves files overwritten by newer versions of the file. During Windows&#160;98 installation, Windows&#160;98 overwrites duplicate files, even if they are newer than those of the installation source. If you experience problems with an application after Windows&#160;98 has installed an older file, you can use Version Conflict Manager to restore the newer version of the file.
<P>
A general protection fault (GPF) is a computer condition that causes a Windows application to stop responding. When a GPF occurs, Dr. Watson collects detailed information about the state of your system, intercepts the software faults, identifies the software that faulted, and offers a detailed description of the cause.

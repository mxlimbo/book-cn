Dial-Up Networking can be used to establish connections to a remote server. This feature is useful for employees who require remote access to the network and for those who require Internet access on demand in a company not connected to the Internet.
<P>
If a modem is being used to set up Dial-Up Networking, it must be installed and configured using the Control Panel. You must then configure the dial-up adapter.
<P>
To have access to ISDN service, you must install an ISDN adapter and run the ISDN Configuration Wizard, which prompts you for the Switch protocol, telephone numbers, and service profile identification (SPID) numbers. ISDN drivers from the ISDN 1.0 Accelerator Pack are not supported in Windows&#160;98.

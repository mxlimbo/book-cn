In this practice, you will use the Windows&#160;98 Task Manager to see a list of tasks running on your computer.
<P>
<UL>
<img src="arrow.gif" width=9 height=14 border=0><B> To see a list of tasks running on your computer</B>
<P>
<OL><LI>       From the Windows&#160;98 <B>Start</B> menu, click <B>Run</B>, type <B>taskman</B>, and click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 Task Manager window appears displaying each task currently running on your computer.
<P>
<LI>       From the Windows&#160;98 <B>Start</B> menu, point to <B>Programs</B>, <B>Accessories</B>, and click <B>WordPad</B>.
<P>
Wordpad is added to the list of running tasks in Task Manager.

<A NAME="228"><H3>Processes and Threads</H3></A><P>
Unlike 16-bit applications, Win32-based applications do not need to yield to other running applications to multitask properly. Instead, they can take advantage of <I>multithreading</I>, a mechanism that Windows&#160;98 provides to facilitate the ability to run applications concurrently.
<P>
A Win32 application running in the system is called a <I>process</I> in terms of the operating system. Each process consists of at least a single thread of execution that identifies the code path flow as it is run by the operating system. A <I>thread</I> is a unit of code belonging to a process that is allocated a time slice from the operating system.
<P>
Win32 applications can initiate multiple threads for a given process to enhance the application for the user by improving throughput, enhancing responsiveness, and aiding background processing. Because of the preemptive multitasking feature of Windows&#160;98, threads of execution allow code from various applications to be smoothly processed.
<P>
For example, the Windows&#160;98 shell (Explorer.exe) is a Win32-based process. Each folder window that opens is a separate thread of execution. Therefore, when you initiate a copy operation between two shell folder windows, the operation is performed on the thread of the target window. During this operation, you can still use other windows in the Windows&#160;98 shell without interruption. You could also start a different copy operation between two other windows.
<P>
<A NAME="229"><H3>The Process Scheduler</H3></A><P>
The Process Scheduler is the Windows&#160;98 component responsible for providing system resources to applications and other processes. It also provides scheduling for processes to allow multiple applications to run concurrently.
<P>
The Process Scheduler gives the illusion that all threads are running concurrently by providing time slices (called quantums) to the threads. For example, if two threads are running on the system, the first thread would execute for a period of time and the second thread would execute immediately after. When the second thread's time slice expires, the first thread would begin executing again.

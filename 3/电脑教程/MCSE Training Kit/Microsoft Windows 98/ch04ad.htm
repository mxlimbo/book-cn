<A NAME="174"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="175"><H3>Win32 Driver Model</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Win32 Driver Model (WDM) provides a common set of drivers that allows hardware developers to develop one device driver that will function in multiple Windows-based operating systems.
<P>
<LI>The five layers to the WDM are the Legacy virtualization driver, the Device class driver, the Device mini driver, the Bus class driver, and the Bus mini driver.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="176"><H3>Using OnNow Power Management</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>OnNow is a power management feature in Windows&#160;98. When OnNow is enabled, the computer is ready for use immediately when the user presses the On button. The computer appears to be off when not in use but responds to wake-up events, such as a telephone ringing, or software that tells the computer to &quot;wake up&quot; at a specified time.
<P>
<LI>System requirements for OnNow include Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). Peripherals must meet ACPI specifications, and applications must support power management and be Plug and Play-compatible.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="177"><H3>Supporting Universal Serial Bus Devices</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a low- to mid-speed bus that you can use for a variety of peripherals, including mouse devices, keyboards, joysticks, scanners, audio devices, and digital cameras.
<P>
<LI>Because USB is fully Plug and Play compatible, you can add USB peripheral devices without having to restart the computer to enable the new device.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="178"><H3>Implementing IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Devices</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>IEEE 1394 is similar to USB, except that it supports devices requiring much higher bandwidth.
<P>
<LI>IEEE 1394 devices are Plug and Play compatible, so when installing an IEEE 1394 device, you do not have to restart the computer to enable the new device.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="179"><H3>Multiple Display Support</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Multiple Display Support is a Windows&#160;98 feature that supports several graphics adapters running as many as nine monitors on a single computer.
<P>
<LI>Multiple display devices can be used as a single, expanded desktop. Multiple display is useful for business applications, desktop publishing, presentation graphics, and games.
<P>
<LI>To configure your computer for multiple displays, you must first install additional display adapters.

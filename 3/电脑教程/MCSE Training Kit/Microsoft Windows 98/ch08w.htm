You use the Printers property sheet to set printer options, including port settings, transmission retry, and device driver options. To manage printing tasks, such as pausing or canceling print jobs, double-click on the printer whose operation you want to change. If you have problems with your printer, make sure that you have the correct printer drivers installed. Determine whether the problem is application- or Windows&#160;98-specific.

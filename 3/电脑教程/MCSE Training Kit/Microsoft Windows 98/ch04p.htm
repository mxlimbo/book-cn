<A NAME="201"><H2>Adding a USB Device</H2></A><P>
USB is a Plug and Play bus, which means that you can add or remove devices from the bus while the computer is turned on. USB identifies and enables the device automatically. Because USB is an external bus, users do not have to open the computer to add a device to the bus.
<P>
When a device such as a new keyboard is added to the bus, the following events occur, all of which are transparent to the user.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	The hub notifies the host controller that a new device exists.
<P>
<LI>	The device is assigned a unique bus address.
<P>
<LI>	The operating system loads the required device driver.
<P>
<LI>	The device is configured.
<P>
<LI>	The device driver is initialized.
<P>
<LI>	The device is now ready for use.
</OL>
<P>
From the user's perspective, after the keyboard is plugged into the bus, the keyboard works.

<A NAME="631"><H2>Browsing the NetWare Network</H2></A><P>
You can use Windows Explorer to browse and connect to NetWare servers on your network. When you open Network Neighborhood, you can see your preferred server and any other servers to which you are attached. If you are using Service for NetWare Directory Services, you can also see the NDS objects in your current environment.
<P>
If you open the Entire Network, you can see all NetWare bindery-based servers and NDS. You can see the servers and trees without mapping to the servers. Mapping specifies the drive letter that will be used to connect to the network computer.
<P>
When you browse or view the properties of a NetWare server, Windows&#160;98 uses one of the allotted server connections to create a temporary connection to that NetWare server. Because you do not log on when browsing or viewing properties, however, the NetWare Monitor.nlm program does not record a user name on the NetWare server. The temporary connection terminates as soon as you close Windows Explorer or the server's Properties dialog box.

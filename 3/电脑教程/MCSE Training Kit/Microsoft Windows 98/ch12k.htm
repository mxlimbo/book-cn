<A NAME="539"><H2>Configuring Network Bindings</H2></A><P>
Because Windows&#160;98 can support multiple network adapters, protocols, and services simultaneously, these network components need a way to interface with each other. To do this, the components use a process called <I>binding</I>, which sets up communication between the components.
<P>
Bindings are configured between network adapter cards and protocols, and between protocols and services. By default, all possible bindings are enabled, but you can optimize performance by modifying bindings. Here are some sample scenarios:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Your computer running Windows&#160;98 has two network adapters. One adapter is connected to a TCP/IP intranetwork; the other is connected to a NetBEUI network. By default, both TCP/IP and NetBEUI will be bound to both network cards, even though only one protocol is ever in use on either network. Disabling the unused bindings can improve your computer's performance slightly.
<P>
<LI>Your computer running Windows&#160;98 has one network adapter, and is running both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol. You have also installed the Client for Microsoft Networks for connectivity with Windows&#160;NT servers, and the Client for NetWare Networks for connectivity with NetWare servers. By default, the Client for Microsoft Networks will be bound to both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol, even though IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol is used only for connecting to NetWare servers. Disabling the unused binding may improve your computer's performance slightly.
<P>
<LI>Suppose your computer uses NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and IPX-compatible Protocol to connect to various type of computers on your network. You use NetBEUI most often to connect to the computers in your workgroup. You can make NetBEUI your <I>default protocol</I> by selecting the default protocol option on the <B>Advanced </B>tab in the Properties dialog box for that protocol (see Figure 12.8). The default protocol overrides other protocols when your computer attempts to establish a session with a remote computer. To optimize performance, you should make the protocol you use most often your default protocol.
</UL>

To improve performance when you have multiple adapters and protocols, you can modify bindings between adapters, protocols, and clients. If you want to configure the bindings for a network component, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Network</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration</B> tab, choose the adapter or protocol whose binding you want to modify.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Properties</B> and select the <B>Bindings</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Select the appropriate bindings.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>

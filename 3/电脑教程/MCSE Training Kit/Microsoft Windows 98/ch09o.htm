Scheduled Tasks is an application for scheduling programs to run at specific times. You can schedule important maintenance utilities such as ScanDisk (see Figure 9.4), Compression Agent, Disk Defragmenter, and Backup to run at regular intervals and when there is the least demand on computer resources. With Scheduled Tasks you can also run other nonmaintenance applications including:

<P>
<LI>Internet Explorer

<LI>Microsoft Chat
<P>
<LI>Paint

An icon in the Scheduled Tasks window represents each task you schedule. You can modify the schedule for any task by double-clicking the icon for that task. A properties window opens with the following three tabs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Task provides the source location of the task.
<P>
<LI>Schedule provides options to configure the frequency, date, and time that the task should be run.
<P>
<LI>Settings provides options for configuring the conditions for a task.
</UL>
<P>
You can remove tasks from the schedule by selecting the task icon and pressing <B>Delete</B>.

<A NAME="528"><H2>Configuring TCP/IP</H2></A><P>
The Windows&#160;98 implementation of TCP/IP includes the standard suite of TCP/IP protocols, and is compatible with other TCP/IP-based networks. Standard TCP/IP protocols include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Internet Protocol (IP)
<P>
<LI>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
<P>
<LI>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
<P>
<LI>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
<P>
<LI>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
</UL>
<P>
<P>
TCP/IP requires configuration before it can be used to communicate on a network. At the least, each network adapter you install in the computer requires an IP address and a subnet mask. The IP address must be unique among the computers on the intra- or inter-network, or TCP/IP will not initialize. A subnet mask is used to distinguish the network ID from the host ID, so that TCP/IP can determine whether an IP address is located on a local or remote network.
<P>
<A NAME="529"><H3>Assigning an IP Address</H3></A><P>
You can assign the IP Address and subnet mask automatically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or you can assign the IP address manually.

<P>
If you want to assign an IP address, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open <B>Control Panel</B> and double-click the <B>Network</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration</B> tab, click the TCP/IP listing for the network adapter you have installed.
<P>
<LI>	Click on <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
The TCP/IP Properties dialog box appears.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>IP Address</B> tab (see Figure 12.4), choose one of the following options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Obtain an IP address automatically
<P>
Windows&#160;98 can obtain TCP/IP configuration information automatically via DHCP. Choosing this option requires that a Windows&#160;NT Server computer or any other computer running a DHCP Server service or maintenance utility program (called <I>daemon</I> for UNIX computers) is available on the network. A Windows&#160;98 computer cannot act as a DHCP server.
<P>
<LI>Specify an IP address
<P>
If you do not have a computer on your network that can act as a DHCP server, or if you need to assign a permanent, static address to your computer, you should specify an IP address and subnet mask manually. 
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Important</B>
<P>
If you use a static IP address, make sure the address is accurate. If you assign an incorrect number, your computer may not be able to communicate on the network. You could also prevent another user from being able to use the network.

<HR>
<P>
<OL START=5>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	If you need to assign a gateway manually, return to the <B>TCP/IP Properties</B> dialog box, click the <B>Gateway</B> tab, and enter the number you wish to assign.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	If you need to enable a Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) server, return to the <B>TCP/IP Properties</B> dialog box, click the <B>WINS Configuration</B> tab, and click <B>Enable WINS Resolution</B> and enter the appropriate WINS server information.
<P>
<LI>	If you need to enable a domain name system (DNS) server, return to the <B>TCP/IP Properties</B> dialog box, click the <B>DNS Configuration</B> tab, click <B>Enable DNS</B>, and then enter the appropriate DNS server information.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>

<A NAME="530"><H3>Obtaining an IP Address Automatically</H3></A><P>
If the Windows&#160;98 computer has access to a DHCP server, then during system startup, the Windows&#160;98 computer receives an IP address, subnet mask, and other optional parameters from the DHCP server. This simplifies TCP/IP configuration, especially for mobile computers. For example, using DHCP (see Figure 12.5), your notebook computer can move from subnet to subnet or intranet to Internet, and be assigned a valid TCP/IP configuration automatically. If the DHCP servers are configured properly, each client will receive a unique IP address.

<P>
In the absence of a DHCP server, a Windows&#160;98 feature called Automatic Private IP Addressing provides support for automatic IP address assignment. When a computer running Windows&#160;98 starts with TCP/IP configured to obtain an address automatically, Windows&#160;98 will first attempt to locate a DHCP server for the address assignment. If Windows&#160;98 fails to locate a DHCP server, the operating system will use Automatic Private IP Addressing. This new Windows&#160;98 mechanism causes the computer to assign itself an IP address in the form of 169.254.x.x. Windows&#160;98 will continue to use this address until it detects the presence of a DHCP server.
<P>
Automatic Private IP Addressing can automatically assign a TCP/IP address to a computer running Windows&#160;98, but it does not generate all of the information typically provided by a DHCP server that uses a name resolution system such as DNS and WINS. Consequently, computers enabled with Automatic Private IP Addressing can communicate only with computers that also have addresses of the form 169.254.x.x; that is, they can communicate only with other computers enabled the same way. Computers that obtain their IP address through Automatic Private IP Addressing cannot communicate with the Internet without a Proxy or Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.
<P>
<A NAME="531"><H3>Assigning a Gateway</H3></A><P>
In order to access computers on other subnets, your Windows&#160;98 computer must be configured for one or more gateways, a combination of hardware and software that connect two different types of networks. Although you can have as many as eight gateways in the Installed Gateway list (see Figure 12.6), the gateway at the top of the list is your default gateway and will always be used if it is available.
<P>

<P>
If you are using DHCP, a DHCP server probably assigns your gateway assignment. Because gateways entered manually will supersede the ones assigned through DHCP, if you manually enter a gateway assignment, be careful not to override the DHCP-provided default gateways.
<P>
<A NAME="532"><H3>Using WINS Server for Computer Name Resolution</H3></A><P>
Because TCP/IP uses IP addresses rather than computer names for interconnectivity, you need either DNS or a WINS server in order to connect to another computer by specifying its computer name.
<P>
If you enable WINS resolution, you can specify the name of a WINS server on which your computer will register its computer name and IP address at system startup. When you attempt to connect to another computer running Windows&#160;98, your computer will query the WINS server to find out the IP address of the remote computer.
<P>
Without a WINS server, you need to maintain a text database file that contains computer names-to-IP address mappings to connect to computers on remote subnets.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
You can browse your own subnet without enabling WINS or having the text database file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="533"><H3>Using DNS for Computer Name Resolution</H3></A><P>
DNS is a hierarchical naming system that uses a combination of text names separated by periods to create a unique name, such as example.microsoft.com. The DNS server contains a database that converts the name assigned to your computer into a number. The number enables the computer to connect to the network. If you enable DNS, you can use your <I>host</I> name (a name to identify your computer on a local network) plus a domain name or suffix to create an Internet address.

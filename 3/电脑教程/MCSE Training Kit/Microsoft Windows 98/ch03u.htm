<A NAME="153"><H2>Overview of DriveSpace&#160;3</H2></A><P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 is a utility that compresses a FAT16 partition or floppy disk. DriveSpace&#160;3 creates a single compressed volume file (CVF) and a <I>host drive. </I>The host drive is an uncompressed drive that contains the CVF.
<P>
You can use DriveSpace&#160;3 to manage drives that you compressed with DriveSpace and DoubleSpace (an MS-DOS compression engine). You can also upgrade a drive that you compressed with DriveSpace or DoubleSpace to DriveSpace&#160;3. DriveSpace&#160;3 cannot compress FAT32 partitions.
<P>
<A NAME="154"><H3>Compressed Volume Files</H3></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 assigns read-only, hidden, and system attributes to the CVF, in order to shield it from the user interface and user actions. The CVF is typically called Drvspace.000, unless a compressed volume file(s) already exists on the host drive, in which case the extension is incremented by one. The host drive is assigned a new drive letter, to which you can apply a hidden attribute.

<B>Caution</B>
<P>
All files and folders written to a compressed drive are actually contained within the single CVF. Be sure to back up compressed drives often; if the CVF is damaged or deleted, you could lose all files and folders contained in the CVF.

<A NAME="155"><H3>How DriveSpace&#160;3 Works</H3></A><P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 compresses the data on your hard disk through two central actions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Token conversion: When DriveSpace&#160;3 sees an attempt to write to a compressed drive, it intercepts the data and searches it for duplicate data strings. In place of each duplicate data string, DriveSpace&#160;3 writes a token that takes up less space than the duplicate data, and yet uniquely identifies the data for which the token substitutes.
<P>
<LI>Sector allocation granularity: DriveSpace&#160;3 uses the sector as its allocation unit rather than the cluster. This results in far less wasted space for smaller files, because a single cluster can then store multiple files.
</UL>
<P>
A driver called Drvspace.bin, which is hidden in the root of the active partition, supports DriveSpace&#160;3 and mounts the compressed drive when the computer starts. Drvspace.bin unloads when protected mode Windows&#160;98 starts; at that point, Drvspacx.vxd replaces it.
<P>
<A NAME="156"><H3>DriveSpace&#160;3 Performance</H3></A><P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 does not generally affect system performance. Smaller files may load faster, because they can be read and uncompressed in RAM faster than the uncompressed files can be read from disk. Larger files, however, may load slowly due to the sector-to-cluster translation that DriveSpace&#160;3 must perform. Faster processors and more RAM will improve disk compression performance.
<P>
<A NAME="157"><H3>DriveSpace&#160;3 Compression Methods</H3></A><P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 supports four different methods of compression, based on user selection:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>No compression
<P>
Does not compress files at all. This provides the best performance of all four methods. Because DriveSpace&#160;3 CVFs use sectors rather than clusters as their allocation units, you are still able to store more data on the drive than on an uncompressed drive.
<P>
<LI>Standard compression
<P>
Provides good compression without sacrificing performance. You can set DriveSpace&#160;3 to implement compression after the drive's capacity has been used to a specified percentage. For example, you could tell DriveSpace&#160;3 to implement standard compression after a drive is 75 percent full.
<P>
<LI>HiPack
<P>
Based on Standard compression, but uses a different algorithm which allows for up to 10 percent better compression than Standard, at the price of slightly lower performance. On Pentium-based computers, the difference in performance is negligible.
<P>
<LI>UltraPack
<P>
Uses a completely different compression format, and achieves aproximately 25 percent better compression than Standard. UltraPack is slower to decompress than HiPack. UltraPack works best on systems with Pentium processors.

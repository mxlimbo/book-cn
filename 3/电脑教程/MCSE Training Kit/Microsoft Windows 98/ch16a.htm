Studies show that as much as 46 percent of total cost of ownership&#151;the amount a business pays to set up and maintain its computer systems&#151;can be attributed to end user operations, including wasted time due to system failures as well as unproductive activities. You can reduce that cost by controlling the end user's environment to prevent actions that can interfere with proper computer performance, thus reducing calls for support. One way to establish that control is with system policies.
<P>
With the system policy support in Windows&#160;98, you can establish configuration settings for specific users, groups of users, and computers. You can choose specific settings to control and allow users to adjust other settings. You must use Windows&#160;98 System Policy Editor to create policies for a computer running Windows&#160;98. These system policies can be implemented on Windows&#160;NT networks, Novell NetWare networks, and even in stand-alone configurations.
<P>
This chapter will help you determine when and how to implement system policies.

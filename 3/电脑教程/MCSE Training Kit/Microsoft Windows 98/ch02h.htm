You can install Windows&#160;98 by upgrading an existing Windows&#160;95 or MS-DOS operating system. You also can install Windows&#160;98 on a newly formatted hard disk or to a new folder. 
<P>
The recommended procedure for installing Windows&#160;98 is to run Setup from within Windows&#160;95. This method retains your current settings and requires the least amount of user input.
<P>
You should run Windows&#160;98 Setup from MS-DOS when:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You want to change the current settings.
<P>
<LI>Setup from Windows&#160;95 fails, and you are unable to start Windows again. This could happen if the failure occurs during the file-copying phase.
<P>
<LI>You want to install Windows&#160;98 on a reformatted hard disk or to a different folder than your current Windows folder.
<P>
<LI>You want to upgrade Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>.
</UL>

<P>
If you set up Windows&#160;98 from MS-DOS using either a network server or local CD-ROM drive, then real-mode network or CD-ROM drivers must be loaded.

Windows&#160;98 Setup differs from Windows&#160;95 Setup. Windows&#160;98 requires only five Setup steps, whereas Windows&#160;95 required 12. In addition, hardware detection and enumeration take place <I>after</I> the first restart in Windows&#160;98. In Windows&#160;95 Setup, hardware detection occurred before the file-copy phase. Performing hardware detection after restarting your computer makes Setup more reliable and reduces the chance that your computer will stop responding.
<P>
When you run Setup from a CD-ROM drive, network, or removable hard drive, the necessary Driver<I>x</I>.inf files are copied to the local hard disk <I>prior</I> to the first restart. This gives Windows&#160;98 access to the installation media in order to continue Setup after your computer is restarted.
<P>
You can start Windows&#160;98 Setup using one of the following methods:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>From CD-ROM 
<P>
Run Setup.exe from the Windows&#160;98 compact disc CD-ROM. Windows&#160;98 requires approximately 175 MB of free space on FAT32 drives, and aproximately 225 MB on FAT16 drives for typical installations.
<P>
<LI>Over a network
<P>
Copy the Windows&#160;98 Setup files from the Windows&#160;98 CD-ROM to a shared directory on a network server, and then run Setup.exe over the network. This requires approximately 115 MB of free disk space on the server, and approximately 130 MB on the local computer.
<P>
<LI>From the hard disk
<P>
Copy the Windows&#160;98 Setup files to the hard disk and then run Setup.exe.

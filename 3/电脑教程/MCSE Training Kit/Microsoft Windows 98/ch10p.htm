<A NAME="461"><H2>Monitoring the Boot Process</H2></A><P>
The first time you boot Windows&#160;98 following a successful setup, Windows&#160;98 creates a Bootlog.txt file (see Figure 10.5) in the root of your system partition, with each step of the boot process immediately logged as it occurs.
<P>

<P>
<CAPTION><B>Figure 10.5</B> <I>The Bootlog.txt file</I></CAPTION>
<P>
The next two times you start your computer, Windows&#160;98 renames the Bootlog.txt file to Bootlog.prv and creates a new Bootlog.txt file. After the third startup, Windows&#160;98 creates a new Bootlog.txt file only if you select the <B>Logged</B> option from the Startup Menu.
<P>
You can use Bootlog.txt to diagnose boot problems such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Driver Load Failures: The first part of Bootlog.txt records whether drivers were successfully loaded. Since no drivers are yet initialized, a failure in this section simply means the driver was not found.
<P>
<LI>Driver Initialization Failures: The next part of Bootlog.txt records critical system drivers. The initialization of these drivers is recorded under the heading SYSCRITINIT. Because no file I/O is allowed during initialization of these drivers, all SYSCRITINIT records are written following the complete initialization of all SYSCRITINIT drivers. The initialization (or lack thereof) of each non-SYSCRITINIT driver is recorded as it occurs.
<P>
If Bootlog.txt does not record any SYSCRITINIT entries, then at least one VxD failed during its SYSCRITINIT phase.
</UL>
<P>
If you want to determine which device failed, perform the following step:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Add <B>LogSysCritInit=1</B> to the <B>[386enh]</B> section of System.ini.
<P>
This causes VxDs to display individually during the SYSCRITINIT phase at the top of the screen (press <B>Esc</B> to bypass the logo so you can see this). 
<P>
Typically, you only see a SYSCRITINITSUCCESS=SHELL, since SHELL is the last VxD. If a VxD is causing the system to stop, the display shows the name of that VxD instead of SHELL.
</OL>

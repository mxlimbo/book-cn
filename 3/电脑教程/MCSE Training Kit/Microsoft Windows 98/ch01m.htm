The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="46"><H3>Windows&#160;98 Overview</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98, the newest Windows operating system, provides an upgraded feature set to Windows&#160;95.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 is a true 32-bit operating system that features full support for 16-bit applications. Although Windows&#160;NT also will support most 16-bit applications, its architecture does not support full backwards-compatibility.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="47"><H3>Windows&#160;98 Features</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Improvements to Windows&#160;98 include improved setup, file system support and reliability, integrated user interface, and reduced cost of ownership.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 provides support for new hardware standards, including OnNow, USB, IEEE 1394, ACPI, DVD, WDM, and multiple display devices.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 introduces improved support for networking and communications features such as NDIS 5.0, Windows Sockets 2.0, WBEM, PPTP, and VPN.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="48"><H3>Selecting Windows&#160;98 as a Client Operating System</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 is designed to support a wide range of hardware and software, while Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0 is designed to be the most powerful 32-bit desktop operating system. For many sites, a mix of both systems will provide the best business solution.
<P>
<LI>Because Windows&#160;NT Workstation is more reliable and secure, some business customers may be best served by deploying Windows&#160;NT Workstation.

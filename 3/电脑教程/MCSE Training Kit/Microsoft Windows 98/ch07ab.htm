Here are some recommendations for optimizing performance of the Windows&#160;98 desktop:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To keep the taskbar from becoming cluttered, limit the number of toolbars added to the taskbar to three or less.
<P>
<LI>For quick access to your favorite Web sites, add the Address toolbar to the taskbar. Accessing a Web page from the Address toolbar is faster than starting Internet Explorer, going to the default home page, and then selecting the Web page you want.
<P>
<LI>To improve performance if your computer is connected to the Internet by a slow link, limit the number of Active Desktop components you have running.

<A NAME="466"><H2>Troubleshooting with Device Manager</H2></A><P>
Device Manager lists all of the devices currently installed on your computer and provides information about the status, driver, and resources for each device. You can open Device Manager by double-clicking the <B>System </B>icon in <B>Control Panel </B>and clicking the <B>Device Manager </B>tab (see Figure 10.7).

Occasionally, Windows&#160;98 may not be able to configure one device without creating conflicts with another device. In such a case, a message usually appears to explain what is happening and what you can do about the problem. The message may include instructions to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Turn off a device to make room for the new device.
<P>
<LI>Disable the new device.
<P>
<LI>Reconfigure a legacy device to make room for the new device.
</UL>
<P>
Device Manager provides a single location for you to check on the status of hardware devices and their drivers, disable or remove devices, and update device drivers.
<P>
<A NAME="467"><H3>Disabled and Problematic Devices</H3></A><P>
In Device Manager, you may occasionally see devices marked as <I>disabled</I> (with an X) or in a <I>problem state</I> (with an exclamation point).
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A <I>disabled</I> device is any device that you disabled through Device Manager using the <B>Disable in the hardware profile</B> option.
<P>
<LI>A device in a <I>problem state</I> is a device for which Windows&#160;98 tried to load a driver but failed.
</UL>
<P>
In both cases, the device may still work if a real-mode (MS-DOS) driver is loaded in Config.sys or Autoexec.bat.
<P>
<A NAME="468"><H3>Configuring Device Properties</H3></A><P>
You can view and modify device properties by double-clicking any device listed in <B>Device Manager</B>. The <B>Properties</B> dialog box for the selected device typically contain three tabs&#151;<B>General, Driver,</B> and <B>Resources</B>. There may be more tabs depending on the type of device. The Resources tab only appears for those devices which require IRQ, I/O addresses, DMA channels, and other resources. Other devices such as CD-ROMs and disk drives have a Settings tab instead.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>General</B> tab displays the name and manufacturer of the selected device. For certain devices, you can prevent Windows&#160;98 from loading the corresponding driver by checking <B>Disable in this hardware profile</B> or <B>Remove from this hardware profile.</B> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Disabling a device</I> means that the device is enabled in the hardware profile, but the driver for the device is not loaded.
<P>
<LI><I>Removing the device</I> from a profile means that the device is removed from the hardware list in Device Manager.
</UL>
<P>
Disabling a device is a good way to troubleshoot a device conflict. When you disable Plug and Play devices, their resources are automatically available for other devices. When you disable a device that is not Plug and Play, you must also remove the device from Device Manager and remove the hardware from your computer to free the resources.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Driver</B> tab shows specific information about the device drivers, including the provider and date. <B>Driver File Details</B>, which you open from this tab, lists file names, locations, and version information. The <B>Update Driver</B> button launches the Update Device Driver Wizard, which searches for updated drivers for your hardware. Updating a device's driver can solve some hardware problems.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Resources</B> tab displays the system resources that the device is using, such as memory addresses, I/O ports, IRQ assignments, and DMA channels. The <B>Conflicting Device List </B>section of this tab lists any resource conflicts.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="469"><H3>Strategies for Resolving Conflicts</H3></A><P>
If you must resolve device conflicts manually, try the following strategies:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify a free resource, and assign the device to use that resource.
<P>
<LI>Disable a conflicting Plug and Play-compliant device to free its resources.
<P>
<LI>Disable a legacy device by removing the legacy device card and not loading the device drivers.
<P>
<LI>Rearrange resources used by another device to free resources needed by the device with the conflict.
<P>
<LI>Change jumpers on your legacy hardware to match the new settings.
</UL>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Caution</B>
<P>
Changing default settings can cause conflicts that make one or more devices unavailable on the system.

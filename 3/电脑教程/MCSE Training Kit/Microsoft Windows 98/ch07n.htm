<A NAME="324"><H2>Launching Applications from the Desktop</H2></A><P>
With the Web style desktop enabled in Windows&#160;98, you can select objects using <I>hover select</I>, and start them using <I>single-click execution</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="325"><H3>Using Hover Select</H3></A><P>
When you position your pointer over an object using hover select, the pointer behaves in the same way as when it is positioned over a hyperlink in Internet Explorer. The pointer changes to a hand, and if you leave the pointer over an object, the object becomes selected.
<P>
<A NAME="326"><H3>Using Single-Click Execution</H3></A><P>
Using single-click execution, you can start a program or open an object by clicking the object once. For example, if you click My Computer on the desktop, a window opens displaying the contents of My Computer. Clicking a shortcut to a Microsoft Word document opens the document in Microsoft Word.
<P>
Users who are familiar with the Windows&#160;95 interface may require a period of adjustment to this method of starting a program. For example, with the Windows&#160;95 interface, you can rename an object by selecting it, then clicking the object again. However, if a user does this with single-click enabled in Windows&#160;98, the selected program or object opens.
<P>
If you want to rename an object using single-click execution:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Right-click the object.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Rename</B> on the context menu.
<P>
<LI>	Type in the new file name.
<P>
<LI>	Press <B>ENTER</B> to save the new name.
</OL>

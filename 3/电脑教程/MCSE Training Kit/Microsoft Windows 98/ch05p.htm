<A NAME="239"><H2>The Virtual Machine Manager</H2></A><P>
The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) manages resources needed for each application and system process running on the computer. The VMM creates and maintains virtual machine environments in which applications and system processes run. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts, and exceptions such as General Protection Faults (GPFs).
<P>
The VMM works with virtual devices, 32-bit protected-mode modules, to allow the virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. The VMM can also map ROM BIOS, MS-DOS, device drivers, and terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) to the address space of a virtual machine so that the application running within the virtual machine has access to MS-DOS system functions and ROM BIOS routines.
<P>
The Virtual Machine Manager is responsible for three key areas of service:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Process scheduling
<P>
<LI>Memory paging
<P>
<LI>MS-DOS Mode support (for MS-DOS-based applications that must have exclusive access to system resources)
</UL>

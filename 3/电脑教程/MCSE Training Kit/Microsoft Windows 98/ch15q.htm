When a user logs on to a stand-alone computer, the local profile loads from the registry to the computer. When the user logs off, the profile is saved in the registry.
<P>
When a user logs on to a computer connected to a network, the roaming profile loads from the server to the local computer. When the user logs off, the profile is saved to both the server and the local registry.
<P>
Each time a user logs on, Windows&#160;98 checks for a local user profile. If none exists, the user is prompted to create a new one. If the user opts not to create a new user profile, Windows&#160;98 loads the default profile.
<P>
You can change the default user profile by clicking Cancel in the Enter Password dialog box, changing the configuration settings, and logging off.

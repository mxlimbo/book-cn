<A NAME="784"><H2>Connecting to the Internet through a Proxy or Firewall</H2></A><P>
Your network administrator can use two tools to regulate a site's Web traffic: firewalls and proxy services.
<P>
A <I>firewall</I> is a mechanism that can examine every packet and can filter traffic based on administratively specified policies. Firewalls support extensive security auditing, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Generation of alarms based on filtered traffic (an alarm is a visual or auditory signal from a computer alerting the user to a problem)
<P>
<LI>Detection of common security violations
<P>
<LI>Monitoring of IP address usage
</UL>
<P>
In networking terms, a <I>proxy</I> server computer acts on behalf of several client computers that are requesting content from the Internet or elsewhere on an intranet. In this case, the proxy server is the secure gateway to the Internet for several client computers (see Figure 17.5).

<P>
The proxy server is nearly transparent to the user and the Internet resource in this communications path. The user interacting with the Internet at a desktop PC usually cannot tell that a proxy server is interceding, unless the user attempts to gain access to a service or to a site that the proxy server is disallowing. The Web server being accessed across the Internet interprets the requests from the proxy server as requests from a browser or FTP client.
<P>
If you want to configure Internet Explorer to use a proxy server, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	From <B>Control</B> <B>Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Internet</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Internet Properties</B> page, select the <B>Connection</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Access the Internet using a proxy server</B> and type the address and port.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Bypass proxy server for local (Intranet) addresses in order </B>to access intranet resources without going through the proxy server.
<P>
<LI>	If you need to add additional proxy servers for different protocols or functions, or if you wish to bypass the proxy server for particular addresses, click <B>Advanced.</B>
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B> to save the settings.
</OL>

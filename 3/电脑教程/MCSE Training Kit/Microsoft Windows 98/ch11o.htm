<A NAME="504"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarized the key points in this chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="505"><H3>Installing Multiple Copies in a Network Environment</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Install from CD-ROM if you are installing Windows&#160;98 on fewer than five computers, or if a computer's configuration varies considerably from the standard setup in a department.
<P>
<LI>If you are installing Windows&#160;98 on more than five computers, perform either a push or a pull installation. Push installations allow you a greater degree of control over the installation process, while pull installations allow users to perform installations at their convenience.
<P>
<LI>A push installation sends an automated setup of Windows&#160;98 from a network server to the client workstation. The network administrator initiates the push installation, which is forced on the target computers.
<P>
<LI>In a pull installation, you copy the Windows source files to a server, and users can download them and perform the installation at their convenience. 
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="506"><H3>Automating a Multiple Installation Setup</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Batch 98 enables you to create a setup script that you can use to run Windows&#160;98 Setup with minimal user input. After you create the setup script, you can run Windows&#160;98 Setup by specifying the name of the script as a command-line parameter.
<P>
<LI>By automating installation, Setup scripts reduce time and cost of the installation process.

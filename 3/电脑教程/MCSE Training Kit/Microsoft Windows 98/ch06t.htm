When you click the <B>Install</B> button on this tab, Windows&#160;98 does most of the work for you. You need only to insert the floppy disk or compact disc that contains the program. You do not have to indicate which drive; Windows&#160;98 searches for a file called Install.exe, first in the floppy drives, then in the CD-ROM drive. You can also install programs from a network drive.
<P>
If Install.exe is not found, Windows&#160;98 searches for Setup.exe. If neither program is found, Windows&#160;98 prompts you for the location of the Setup program.
<P>
<A NAME="283"><H3>Removing Programs</H3></A><P>
With the <B>Add/Remove</B> button, you can remove any application that appears on the list above the button. Only programs that have been written to take advantage of this feature can be removed through this window.
<P>
Clicking the <B>Add/Remove</B> button runs the original setup program for the selected application. You can then add or remove additional components of that application, or the application itself, through the application's Setup program.
<P>
When you remove programs with <B>Add/Remove</B>, their entries in the registry are marked as deleted. Microsoft Registry Checker scans and backs up the registry once a day upon startup. During this scan, if Registry Checker determines that the registry contains 500K or more of keys marked as deleted, it will optimize the registry upon next boot. Optimization reclaims wasted registry space, reserving 4K worth of data to preserve the registry key's header.

<A NAME="710"><H2>Using System Policy Editor</H2></A><P>
System Policy Editor is a tool for creating and modifying system policy files with templates. You must install System Policy Editor after Windows&#160;98 installation.
<P>
If you want to install System Policy Editor, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> icon in <B>Control Panel</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Windows Setup</B> tab of the dialog box.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Have Disk</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Insert the Windows&#160;98 installation disk.
<P>
<LI>	Locate the System Policy Editor (Poledit) folder on the installation disk, and then in the <B>Copy manufacturer's files from</B> box, type the drive letter and path, (for example: D:\tools\reskit\netadmin\poledit where D is the name of your CD-ROM drive), and click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	The <B>Have Disk </B>dialog box (see Figure 16.2) appears, listing the component for System Policy Editor installation. Select the <B>System Policy Editor </B>check box and click <B>Install</B>.
</OL>
<P>
Installation of System Policy Editor adds a shortcut to the <B>System Tools</B> menu.

<P>

You can create a system policy that only contains settings for Default User or Default Computer, or you can add entries to system policies for specific users, groups, and computers with the <B>Edit</B> menu in System Policy Editor.
<P>
<A NAME="711"><H3>User Policies</H3></A><P>
A user system policy applies registry settings when a specific user logs on. When policies exist for a user and also for one or more groups to which the user belongs, only the settings in the user policy apply. If there is no user or group policy for a specific user, the Default User policy (if it exists) applies.
<P>
<A NAME="712"><H3>Group Policies</H3></A><P>
Group policies make it possible to add specific restrictions to Windows&#160;NT Directory Services (NTDS) global groups or NetWare groups. However, you must follow these guidelines:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You must install group policy support (Grouppol.dll) on each computer that you use to create group policies and on each computer to which those policies will apply. You select group policy support as an option in a custom Windows&#160;98 installation, or you can install group policy support through the <B>System Tools </B>category of components on the <B>Windows Setup </B>tab using the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<LI>You must use a central security server, such as a Windows&#160;NT domain or a NetWare server, with group policies.
<P>
<LI>Group policies apply only to existing Windows&#160;NT global groups or Novell NetWare groups. You cannot create new groups with System Policy Editor.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
Computers without Grouppol.dll installed do not process group policies. However, you can still use the same Config.pol file for all computers; the computers that do not support group policies disregard that section of the policy file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="713"><H4>Setting Group Priorities</H4></A><P>
Group policies download in order from the lowest priority group to the highest priority group. The group with the highest priority processes last, so settings for this group overwrite settings defined in the other group policies.
<P>
If you want to set priority levels for group policies, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>System Policy Editor</B>, click <B>File</B> then <B>Open Policy</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Locate the Config.pol file and click <B>Open</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Options</B> menu, click <B>Group Priority</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Group Priority</B> dialog box, click a group, and then use the <B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> buttons to set the desired priority. Groups highest in the list have the highest priority.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="714"><H3>Computer Policies</H3></A><P>
Computer policies define settings for a default computer or for specifically named computers. The default computer settings apply when a user logs on to a computer that does not have individual policies assigned.
<P>
Computer settings in system policies prevent users from modifying the hardware and environment settings for the operating system, ensuring that Windows&#160;98 starts up in a predictable way. You can set options to restrict access to computer-specific system and network features. When you apply system policies to a computer, they affect all users of that computer.

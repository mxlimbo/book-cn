Windows&#160;98 incorporates improvements to the Windows environment in areas such as Setup, file system support, user interface, reliability, and total cost of ownership. For example, Windows&#160;98 integrates the user's computing environment with the Internet, providing a single method for accessing information. Also, large organizations can take advantage of new manageability features that help reduce the cost of managing and maintaining the operating system.
<P>
The following table describes key improvements in Windows&#160;98.

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5">

<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Description</B></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Setup</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Hardware detection occurs after the file copy phase is complete. If Setup starts from within Windows&#160;95, there is no attempt to detect legacy hardware. Instead, the registry settings for legacy hardware are maintained. This improves the stability of the setup process.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">File System Support</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Windows&#160;98, like Windows&#160;95 OSR2, supports FAT32, a file system that improves file storage efficiency by reducing cluster sizes on large partitions. FAT32 also greatly increases the amount of hard disk space that can be included in a single partition.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">User Interface</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is integrated into the Windows&#160;98 shell as a single method for accessing information, whether the information is local, on an intranet, or on the Internet. Windows Scripting Host (WSH) is a language-independent scripting host for 32-bit Windows-based platforms that enables scripting languages, such as VBScript and JScript, to be executed directly on the desktop, without having to be embedded in an HTML document.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Reliability and Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Windows&#160;98 includes wizards and utilities that help users diagnose and correct problems, as well as maximize performance. The task of managing device driver updates is made easier through a Web-based utility that automatically searches for and installs required updates. The registry backup and restore tools make the registry more stable.</TD>

Windows&#160;98 supports long file names, augmenting the MS-DOS 8.3 file naming convention. File names in Windows&#160;98 can be up to 255 characters long, with the entire file path not to exceed 260 characters.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 implements long file names on FAT partitions by concatenating a series of MS-DOS-compatible directory entries into a single file name entry. If you open and save a file with a long file name in a program that does not support long file names, Windows&#160;98 preserves the long file name as long as you do not rename or move the file.
<P>
On a network, Windows&#160;98 uses a process called tunneling to preserve long file names for files that you open and save with an application that does not recognize long file names.
<P>
Files in Windows&#160;98 can have a long file name, as well as an alias, or MS-DOS name, which conforms to the 8.3 naming convention.

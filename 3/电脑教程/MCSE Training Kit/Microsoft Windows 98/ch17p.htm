The Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) maintains a rating system of levels of language, nudity, sex, and violence on Web sites. By using these ratings, you can prevent Internet Explorer users from accessing sites that rate unacceptably to your organization.

<A NAME="775"><H3>Configuring Ratings Settings</H3></A><P>
There are four categories for which you can configure ratings: language, nudity, sex, and violence. You can configure each category individually for five rating levels, Level 0 through Level 4. Complete descriptions of each level appear in the <B>Content Advisor </B>dialog box. In addition, clicking the <B>More Info </B>button will display the Internet page for the rating service.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
Because not all sites are rated, you can also use the <B>General</B> tab of the <B>Content Advisor</B> dialog box to restrict access to unrated sites. You can also use the supervisor password to allow users access to unrated sites.

<A NAME="776"><H3>Rating Systems and Bureaus</H3></A><P>
By default, Internet Explorer uses the RSAC rating system. You can use another rating system by copying the .rat file from the rating system into the C:\Windows\System folder. You can choose to use the additional rating system by adding it to the list of rating systems.
<P>
If you want to use the additional rating system, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control</B> <B>Panel</B>, double-click <B>Internet</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Internet Properties</B> dialog box, select the <B>Content</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Content Advisor</B> box, click <B>Settings</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Type in a password and click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	From the <B>Content Advisor</B> dialog box, select the <B>Advanced</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Rating Systems</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Add</B> and browse the system folder to locate the new rating file.
<P>
<LI>	Select the file and then click <B>Open</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK </B>three times to accept the changes.
</OL>
<P>
Different rating systems use different methods to determine a given Web site's rating. The rating label information may be within the HTML document as a tag, within the HTTP header, or it may be obtained from an independent Web server, or ratings bureau, that distributes rating information. If a rating system uses a ratings bureau, you can add it to the list of bureaus in the <B>Content Advisor</B> dialog box.
<P>
If you want to use a ratings bureau, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	From the <B>Content Advisor</B> dialog box, select the <B>Advanced</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Ratings bureau</B> drop-down box, type the name of the bureau you want to use.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="777"><H3>Storing Rating Information</H3></A><P>
A file called Ratings.pol, located in the C:\Windows\System folder, stores rating information.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
Despite its extension, Ratings.pol cannot be viewed or edited in System Policy Editor.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
Your supervisor password is encrypted and stored in the following registry location:
<P>
<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ratings\Key</PRE>
<P>
If you forget your supervisor password, you can run Registry Editor and delete the Key value above. The next time Windows&#160;98 requires the supervisor password, the system will prompt you for a new one. You can remove all ratings by deleting the supervisor password <I>and</I> deleting Ratings.pol.

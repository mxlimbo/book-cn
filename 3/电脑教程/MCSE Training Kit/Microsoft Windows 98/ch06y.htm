<A NAME="290"><H2>Registry Editor</H2></A><P>
You should use a Control Panel icon, such as <B>Add New Hardware</B>, to make modifications to system settings. However, if it is essential to modify the registry directly, you can use a tool called Registry Editor (Regedit.exe), located in the C:\Windows folder, to view and modify current registry settings.
<P>
<A NAME="291"><H3>Viewing and Altering Registry Values</H3></A><P>
Registry Editor (see Figure 6.14) is divided into two panes. Keys and subkeys are listed in the left pane, and value entries are listed in the right pane. In the left pane, there is a plus sign (<B>+)</B> beside a key that has additional subkeys. The plus sign (+) changes to a minus sign (-) when the list is expanded to show the subordinate entries.
<P>
When you click a key or subkey, the associated value entry appears in the right pane, and the entire path of the selected registry key appears in the Registry Editor status bar.

<B>Caution</B>
<P>
Microsoft does not recommend or support making changes directly to the registry when an alternative exists. Most changes to the registry should be made through Control Panel. Unlike the Windows&#160;NT Registry Editor, there is no Read-Only Mode option in Windows&#160;98. Changes to the Windows&#160;98 registry are immediate and may be irrevocable. If you must make a change to the registry, Microsoft recommends backing up your current registry first.

<A NAME="292"><H3>Registry Editor Commands</H3></A><P>
Several useful Registry Editor commands facilitate work with the registry. The Registry Editor contains a search function. From the <B>Edit</B> menu, click <B>Find </B>and type the string you wish to locate. You can search keys, value names, and value data for the desired string.
<P>
The <B>Registry</B> menu has the commands: <B>Export Registry File</B> and <B>Import Registry File. </B>Use the export command to save total or partial registry data in a *.reg text file, and use the import command to restore it on the same or on a different computer.

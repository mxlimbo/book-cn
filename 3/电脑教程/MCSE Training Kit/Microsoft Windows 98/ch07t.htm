Windows&#160;98 provides two different ways to access and view content on the desktop: Windows Classic style desktop, and Web style desktop. Using Windows classic style, you view folders, select objects, and open files in the same way as in Windows&#160;95. The Web style desktop, on the other hand, functions as a Web browser.
<P>
Using the Web style desktop, you select objects with hover select (the pointer behaves the same way as when it is positioned over a hyperlink in Internet Explorer), and you start objects with single-click execution.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 allows you to customize the characteristics of local and network folders. You can customize your folders by editing the Folder.htt file with an HTML editor, and you can also provide a picture to display in the background of the folder.

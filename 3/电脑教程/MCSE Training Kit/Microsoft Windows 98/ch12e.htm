<A NAME="512"><H2>Identifying Your Computer on the Network</H2></A><P>
In order to connect a Windows&#160;98 computer to a network, you must provide a way for the computer to identify itself. You do this by assigning it a unique name.
<P>
<A NAME="513"><H3>Assigning a Computer Name</H3></A><P>
Each Windows&#160;98 computer on a network uses a unique name to distinguish it from all other computers connected to the network. If another computer, workgroup, or domain on the same network has the same name, your computer cannot communicate on the network. Your computer name can have up to 15 characters, and should contain no blank spaces. Although Windows&#160;98 allows you to enter spaces in a computer name, spaces can cause problems with network connectivity. For example, MS-DOS clients cannot connect to a computer with spaces in its name. The names are not case sensitive.
<P>
<A NAME="514"><H3>Workgroup</H3></A><P>
In addition to the computer name, you must also specify a unique workgroup name. The workgroup name, which is used for organizational purposes only, defines your Network Neighborhood. Whenever you explore the Network Neighborhood on the desktop, the computers it displays are those that have the same workgroup name as your computer.
<P>
You should assign a common workgroup name to computers that share resources such as files and printers with each other. For example, you can assign a common workgroup name to computers that belong to a single department, project, or site.
<P>
<A NAME="515"><H3>Computer Description</H3></A><P>
You may also enter an optional description of your computer. The description will appear to anyone browsing the network, but it has no other function.
<P>
If you want to assign a name to your computer, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Choose <B>Start</B>, <B>Settings</B>, and then <B>Control Panel</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Network</B> icon and click the <B>Identification</B> tab (see Figure 12.1).
<P>
<LI>	Enter a computer name, workgroup name, and computer description for your computer.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>

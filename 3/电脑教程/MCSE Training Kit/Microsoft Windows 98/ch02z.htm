<A NAME="123"><H2>Generating a Setup Script</H2></A><P>
You can use or modify an existing setup script, or you can create a new setup script by performing a custom setup.
<P>
<A NAME="124"><H3>Editing a Setup Script</H3></A><P>
If you wish to change any of the values for the items in a setup script, you can edit the script using a text editor. You may also want to create alternate or more detailed setup scripts by editing existing scripts. The following are editing guidelines for the setup script file:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Each section starts with a unique section heading enclosed in brackets ([ ]).
<P>
<LI>Each section can contain one or more entries. The typical entry consists of a key name, an equal sign, and a value.
<P>
<LI>Key names within a section need not be unique. Key names have defined values. Set the value for optional components to be installed as &quot;1&quot;. A value of &quot;0&quot; means the component will not be installed.
<P>
<LI>Comments can be included on a line <I>after</I> the value, and begin with a semicolon. Setup ignores all text after a semicolon until the next line.
</UL>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
If you have existing setup scripts for Windows&#160;95 or Windows 3.1<I>x</I>, they can be edited to include the new components available with Windows&#160;98.

<A NAME="125"><H3>Creating a New Setup Script</H3></A><P>
Creating a new setup script allows you to direct the Setup program to configure settings to your specifications. If you want to create a new setup script, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Perform Setup on a newly formatted hard disk, and then select the Custom Setup option.
<P>
<LI>	Select the components that you want to install.
<P>
<LI>	After you complete Setup, use a text editor to copy the following sections from the Setuplog.txt file, located in the root directory of the C drive:
</OL>
<P>
<PRE>[Setup]
[OptionalComponents]</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="126"><H3>Running Setup with a Script</H3></A><P>
To run Setup with an installation script, specify the path to the script file on the command line. The following example shows how to run Setup using a setup script named Script.inf:
<P>
<PRE>D:\Win98\Setup.exe A:\Script.inf</PRE>
<P>
&#150;or&#150;
<P>
<PRE>\\Server\Win98\Setup.exe \\Server\Scripts\Script.inf</PRE>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
Setup scripts can be given any MS-DOS 8.3 filename with an .inf extension. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
After you create a setup script, you can install Windows&#160;98 automatically by running Setup at each client computer, using the name of the setup script as a command-line parameter. You can run Setup from any of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A login script.
<P>
<LI>Server-based system management software.
<P>
<LI>A batch file, distributed on disk or by e-mail, that contains the appropriate setup command line.
</UL>

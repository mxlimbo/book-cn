<A NAME="407"><H2>Using Version Conflict Manager</H2></A><P>
If you install Windows&#160;98 on a computer running software that was published after Windows&#160;98, it is possible that the application installed one or more system files that were newer versions than the files included with Windows&#160;98. The determining factor in identifying an older file is not the file date, but rather the file version as displayed in the file's <B>Properties</B> window. Windows&#160;98 Setup automatically installs the Windows&#160;98 file over the newer file, and saves the newer version of the file. Those files can be viewed with Version Conflict Manager, located in the <B>Tools</B> menu of the System Information Utility.
<P>
Version Conflict Manager's purpose is to prevent any file version prompts during the file copy phase of Windows&#160;98 Setup, and to simplify the process of restoring system files that are overwritten by Windows&#160;98 Setup.
<P>
<A NAME="408"><H3>How Version Conflict Manager Works</H3></A><P>
If you experience problems with an application after Windows&#160;98 installs an older file, you can use Version Conflict Manager to restore the newer version of the file. Reinstalling the entire application is no longer necessary.
<P>
Version Conflict Manager displays the file name, the backup date, and the backed-up version of every newer file that Windows&#160;98 replaced. It also lists the current version of that file in use.
<P>
When you use Version Conflict Manager to restore a newer file, it moves the older file to the C:\Windows\VCM folder and changes the extension to .000. You can use Version Conflict Manager to return to the original configuration, replacing the older file with the newer file stored in C:\Windows\VCM.
<P>
Version Conflict Manager also creates a log file, Verback.log, stored in the C:\Windows folder, which identifies replaced files and their original locations. You can open and read the file using NotePad.

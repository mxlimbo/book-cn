The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="727"><H3>An Overview of System Policies</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>System policies enable you to restrict what users can do from the desktop, restrict access to Control Panel options, customize parts of the desktop, and configure network settings.
<P>
<LI>When the user logs on, Windows&#160;98 checks the user's configuration information for the location of the policy file.
<P>
<LI>Both System Policy Editor and Registry Editor allow you to gain access to a remote computer's registry. System Policy Editor provides access to a subset of keys, while Registry Editor provides access to the entire registry.
<P>
<LI>System policies can establish user-specific and computer-specific settings. Mandatory user profiles can establish only user-specific settings.
<P>
<LI>In order to implement system policies, you need to plan your approach, install your tools, create a policy file, and load the policy file in the proper location.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="728"><H3>Creating Policies With System Policy Editor</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>System Policy Editor enables you to establish computer configurations for users, groups, and computers by selecting registry settings that will overwrite previous settings.
<P>
<LI>A user system policy applies registry settings when a specific user logs on.
<P>
<LI>Group policies make it possible to add specific restrictions to Windows&#160;NT Directory Services (NTDS) global groups or NetWare groups.
<P>
<LI>Computer policies define settings for a default computer or for specifically named computers. The default computer settings apply when a user logs on to a computer that does not have individual policies assigned.

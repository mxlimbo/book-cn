<A NAME="516"><H2>Installing and Configuring Network Adapter Cards</H2></A><P>
You must install a network adapter card that the computer uses to interface with the network. This card provides the physical connection to the network type, media, and protocols.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports a wide range of network types including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ethernet
<P>
<LI>Token Ring
<P>
<LI>Attached Resource Computer network (ArcNet)
<P>
<LI>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
<P>
<LI>Wireless technologies, including infrared
<P>
<LI>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
</UL>
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports up to four network adapter cards in a single computer. After you physically install the drivers for the network adapter card in the computer, you can install the adapter and configure it for Windows&#160;98 using the <B>Add New Hardware</B> <B>Wizard</B> or the <B>Network</B> icon in Control Panel.

<P>
Windows&#160;98 automatically assigns the interrupt request line (IRQ) and input/output (I/O) address for the adapter, or prompts you to confirm those resources if it cannot determine what resources to use.
<P>
If you want to install and configure a network adapter, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Network </B>icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration </B>tab, click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Select Network Component Type </B>dialog box, click <B>Adapter</B>, andthen click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Choose the manufacturer and adapter, and then click <B>OK </B>(see Figure 12.2).
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK </B>to close the Network properties sheet.
<P>
After copying the files needed to support the adapter, Windows&#160;98 may prompt you to confirm or change resources for the adapter if there is a conflict. If there are no conflicts, the program will prompt you to restart the computer.
<P>
<LI>	After the computer restarts, you can configure the adapter by returning to Control Panel and double-clicking the <B>Network </B>icon.
<P>
<LI>	Click the adapter, then click <B>Properties</B>. Depending on the adapter, you can change the driver type and the binding.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="517"><H3>NDIS</H3></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 uses the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) to support adapter cards. NDIS is an industry-standard device driver specification that is independent of both the network protocol and the adapter card. NDIS allows a network adapter card to use more than one protocol.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports NDIS 2.0, 3.1, 4.0, and 5.0 drivers. NDIS 5.0 supports a wide range of network media including Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and wide area network (WAN) technology. NDIS 5.0-compliant drivers also provide performance improvements, including NDIS power management.

<B>Important</B>
<P>
If your network adapter card does not support NDIS 5.0, contact the manufacturer for an updated device driver. For more information on NDIS 5.0, refer to Appendix H, &quot;<A HREF="chah.htm#931">Introduction to NDIS 5.0</A>.&quot;
<P>
This course does not discuss earlier NDIS-compliant drivers or Open Data-link Interface (ODI) drivers. For more information on configuring these types of network adapters, refer to the <I>Microsoft</I> <I>Windows&#160;98 Resource Kit</I>.

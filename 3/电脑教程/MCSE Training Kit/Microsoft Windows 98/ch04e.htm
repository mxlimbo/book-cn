<A NAME="184"><H2>Overview of the Win32 Driver Model</H2></A><P>
The Win32 Driver Model was first implemented in Windows&#160;95 OSR 2.1. It is a device driver architecture created to provide a standard set of I/O services that can be utilized by any Windows operating system that implements the WDM. This allows developers to create a single driver to work in Windows&#160;98, and future versions of Windows&#160;NT.
<P>
A <I>hook</I> is a point in the Windows message-handling mechanism where an application can install a subroutine to monitor the message traffic in the system and process certain types of messages before they reach the target window procedure. Prior to WDM, device drivers included hooks for a particular operating system in addition to the elements necessary to interact with a specific piece of hardware. This approach prevented device drivers from being supported by both Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0.

Although in some cases Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT can share a single network adapter driver, this is due to each platform's mutual support of Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and should not be confused with the Win32 Driver Model.

As a result of the evolution of the Win32 Driver Model from Windows&#160;95 OSR&#160;2.1 to Windows&#160;98, some incompatibilities may exist between drivers written for Windows&#160;95 OSR 2.1 and Windows&#160;98. You can resolve these incompatibilities by installing the latest vendor-provided driver.

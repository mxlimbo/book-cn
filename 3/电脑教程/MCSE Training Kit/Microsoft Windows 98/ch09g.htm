Because the System Information utility is intended as a centralized troubleshooting tool, you can use it to view files from different programs.
<P>
You can use System Information utility to view the following file formats:

<LI>Cabinet files (*.cab) are created by the Windows Report Tool, which is discussed later in this chapter. (Other programs create *.cab files, and the System Information utility can also display the individual files contained in the *.cab file.) After the Windows Report Tool creates a .cab file, you can open the System Information portion of the file (.nfo) from the File menu. The <B>Cab</B> <B>Contents</B> menu item in the Tools menu lists the individual files contained in the selected *.cab file.
<P>
<LI>Text files (*.txt) are created by a text editor such as Notepad, exported from the Microsoft System Information utility, or copied from the Microsoft System Information utility and pasted into a text editor.
<P>
<LI>Data files (*.dat) are created by Hwinfo.exe. Hwinfo.exe is a program that is used by the Windows Report Tool to gather information about the hardware on the computer. It is not meant to be run as a stand-alone program.

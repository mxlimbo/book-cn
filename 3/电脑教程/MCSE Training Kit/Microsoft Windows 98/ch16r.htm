<OL>
<LI>	You frequently install new programs on your servers and occasionally change the location of these programs. You would like to minimize support calls by providing and updating desktop and Start menu shortcuts to these programs, while preventing users from deleting or modifying them. You also would like to prevent users from changing display and other settings that might cause problems with the programs. Would you choose to implement this with mandatory user profiles or system policies? Explain your reasons.

<LI>	While editing the system policy for Default Computer in System Policy Editor, you think that you may have unintentionally made a change to an option. Unfortunately, you can not remember whether the previous default for this option was enabled or disabled. What can you do to make sure that a change does not take effect?

<LI>	You delegate the task of implementing system policies to another network administrator. He implements user policies, but is hesitant to implement computer policies because he is concerned about possible conflicts between the two types of policies. Is this a valid concern? Why or why not?

<LI>	Your Windows&#160;NT domain contains the user accounts of your 2,000 Windows&#160;98 users. You implement system policies, but you are not satisfied with the slow performance when downloading the policy file during shift changes. How can you speed up this process?

<P>
<LI>	You create group policies using System Policy Editor, and you save the Config.pol file on your Windows&#160;NT-based security provider. You soon discover that while some computers implement the group policies, others don't. However, the computers that do not process the group policies implement the Default User policy. What is probably causing the problem?

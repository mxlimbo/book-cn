Integrated networking is a key feature of Windows&#160;98. This lesson provides an overview of Windows&#160;98 interoperability with Novell Netware, including the capabilities of Windows&#160;98 computers running Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks on NetWare networks. This lesson also describes the procedures for installing and configuring the protocols necessary to connect to Novell NetWare networks.

Windows&#160;98 supports interoperation with NetWare version 3.<i>x</i>. These versions of NetWare use a database called the <I>bindery</I> to organize network objects such as users, groups, and print queues. Each server has a bindery, which it does not share with the other servers. Windows&#160;98 also supports NetWare 4.<i>x</i> servers that emulate the bindery used in earlier versions of NetWare.
<P>
In addition to bindery support, Windows&#160;98 includes support for NetWare Directory Services (NDS), used in NetWare versions 4.<i>x</i>. These versions of NetWare implement a network-wide, hierarchical directory structure for network objects called a <I>tree</I>. All NetWare 4.<i>x</i> servers on a network can share the same NDS tree.
<P>
A Windows&#160;98 computer running Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks on a NetWare network can:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Log on to a Novell NetWare bindery-based server or Netware Directory Services (NDS) tree with Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services installed.
<P>
<LI>Connect to file and print resources on NetWare servers.
<P>
<LI>Run most NetWare 3.<i>x</i> utilities (with some exceptions, like <B>nwuser</B> and <B>rprinter</B>).
<P>
<LI>Share resources with NetWare clients.
<P>
<LI>Download roaming user profiles and system policies from a NetWare server. Roaming profiles are for users who log on to more than one computer.
</UL>

Figure 14.1 illustrates the capabilites of Windows&#160;98 computers running on Novell NetWare networks.

<P>
To interoperate with Novell NetWare, you must install a protocol, a client, and, if using NDS, an additional service.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>For NetWare 3.<i>x</i> and 4.<i>x</i> systems that are bindery-based, you install the internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX)-compatible Protocol and Client for NetWare Networks.
<P>
<LI>For NetWare 4.<i>x</i> NDS systems, you install the IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol, Client for NetWare Networks, and Service for NetWare Directory Services.

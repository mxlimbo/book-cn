The first step that Windows&#160;98 Setup performs is preparing for installation, a process that includes determining if your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements, and taking measures to prevent software conflicts during Setup.
<P>
If you decide to dual boot Windows&#160;98 and another operating system, you should be aware of issues that may arise. For example, dual booting Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT is not recommended because Windows&#160;98 cannot access NTFS partitions, and Windows&#160;NT cannot access FAT32 partitions.
<P>
The recommended procedure for installing Windows&#160;98 is to run Setup from within Windows&#160;95. This method retains your current settings and requires the least amount of user input. You can also run Setup from within MS-DOS on a newly formatted hard disk or when upgrading from Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>.

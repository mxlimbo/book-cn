<A NAME="427"><H2>Using Registry Checker</H2></A><P>
The registry is a database repository for information about your computer. This includes: hardware configuration, user information, and software component information.
<P>
There are several occasions in which you should back up the registry, including, for example, before editing the registry using Registry Editor, or before installing an application. You should always back up the registry before troubleshooting your computer.
<P>
Registry Checker is a system maintenance utility that finds and fixes registry problems, and backs up the registry regularly. Windows&#160;98 provides a Windows-based utility and an MS-DOS-based utility for scanning, backing up, and restoring the registry and system configuration files.
<P>
Registry Checker backs up the registry once each day when you start the computer. If a serious problem is found in the registry, Registry Checker restores the registry from a backup copy. Registry Checker maintains as many as five backups of the registry that successfully started the computer and attempts to fix the registry if it does not locate a backup.
<P>
You can change the number of registry backups that Registry Checker maintains by editing the following line in C:\Windows\Scanreg.ini:
<P>
<PRE>MaxBackupCopies={<I>number between 1 and 99</I>}</PRE>

You can control several other Registry Checker options in Scanreg.ini (see Figure 10.1), including the default location for registry backups.

<A NAME="428"><H3>ScanRegW</H3></A><P>
<I>ScanRegW</I> is the Windows-based Registry Checker utility. This utility scans and then backs up the following system configuration files: Registry (User.dat and System.dat), Win.ini, and System.ini. Registry Checker compresses these files and stores them in a cabinet (*.cab) file in C:\Windows\sysbckup, a hidden folder, as Rb###.cab. This scan occurs automatically when you start the system. You can run ScanRegW.exe when you want to force a scan and backup of these files.
<P>
<A NAME="429"><H3>ScanReg</H3></A><P>
<I>ScanReg</I> is the MS-DOS-based Registry Checker utility. If ScanRegW detects a problem with the registry, it prompts you to restart the computer to fix the problem. The restart of the computer causes ScanReg to run and restore the registry from a known good backup, or to repair the registry if no backups are available.
<P>
ScanReg has several options that are available when it is run from the command line. Windows&#160;98 automatically invokes these options in the course of normal ScanReg operation.

Do not use backups of configuration files from Windows&#160;95 on a Windows&#160;98 system. If you do, the computer will not start.

Registry Checker runs automatically during startup. If you want to run Registry Checker manually, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Click <B>Start, Run</B>, and type in <B>Scanregw.exe</B>.
<P>
&#150; Or &#150;
<P>
<LI>Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs, Accessories, System Tools</B>, and click <B>System Information</B>. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, click <B>Registry Checker</B>.

<P>
<A NAME="431"><H3>Exporting and Importing in the Registry Editor</H3></A><P>
You use the <B>Export</B> and <B>Import</B> commands in Registry Editor to export and import portions of the registry. The export capabilities of Registry Editor save a specific branch or the entire registry in text format as a *.reg file. You can restore either the entire registry or a branch of it, by importing a *.reg file that was created by exporting the registry.

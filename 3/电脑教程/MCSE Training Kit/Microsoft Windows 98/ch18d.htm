This lesson discusses Dial-Up Networking. With Dial-Up Networking you can connect to a remote computer or network through a modem or ISDN adapter, rather than through a network interface card.
<P>
To set up Dial-Up Networking you need one or more compatible modems or ISDN devices and sufficient hard disk space to install the Dial-Up Networking software.
<P>
After installing and configuring your hardware devices (ISDN, modems, etc.) you can use the Dialing Properties utility to define different locations from which you dial. For example, you can create two different locations (home and office) and enter information for each location. Then, whenever you create a new dialing location, Dialing Properties automatically adjusts the telephone number based on the location from which you are dialing.

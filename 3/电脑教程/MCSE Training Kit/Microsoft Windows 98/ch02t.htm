<A NAME="107"><H2>Preparing to Run Windows&#160;98 Setup in MS-DOS</H2></A><P>
To install Windows&#160;98 from MS-DOS, you need to run the Setup.exe file located on your Windows&#160;98 CD-ROM, floppy disk, or network server. When Setup begins, ScanDisk (running in real-mode) scans the hard disk for file system errors (see Figure 2.6), and Setup copies the files needed for setup.

<A NAME="108"><H3>Real-Mode ScanDisk Runs</H3></A><P>
ScanDisk fixes any errors it finds in the file system, except for long file name errors. Real-mode ScanDisk cannot correct long file name errors.

<P>
If you receive file system errors while running Setup, you should run ScanDisk and perform a surface scan before running Setup again.

<P>
After ScanDisk completes its process, Setup checks your registry by running the ScanReg utility. If a corrupted registry is detected, Setup attempts to repair it. If the repair is successful, Setup continues. If the repair is unsuccessful, you are prompted to restart Setup and install Windows&#160;98 in a new directory.
<P>
<A NAME="109"><H3>Setup Expands and Copies *.CAB Files</H3> </A><P>
After ScanDisk runs, Setup creates the C:\Wininst0.400 folder, then expands Precopy1.cab, Precopy2.cab, Precopy3.cab and Mini.cab, and copies their contents to the folder. Mini.cab contains a run-time version of Windows&#160;95 or Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I> that enables the Setup Wizard to function.

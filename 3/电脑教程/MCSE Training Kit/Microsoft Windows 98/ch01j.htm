Windows&#160;98 provides better support for the Windows environment, for new hardware standards, and for networking and communications features. 
<P>
Improvements to the Windows environment include a more stable setup process, support for an increased amount of hard drive space available in a single partition, a user interface that is integrated with the Internet, and wizards and utilities that help users maximize performance.
<P>
Support for new hardware standards allows multiple devices, including the ability to use multiple monitors on one computer. Windows&#160;98 offers a variety of new support features for audio and visual components and storage devices such as DVD technology. Also, the Windows Driver Model (WDM) makes it easier for vendors to support all Windows platforms.
<P>
Increased support for networking and communications features, such as NDIS, Windows Sockets, WBEM, ISDN, and PPRP, provide high speed transmission and quality delivery of a variety of data, and concurrent access to multiple network transports.

<A NAME="558"><H2>Installing and Configuring Network Printers</H2></A><P>
To install and configure a network printer, you follow many of the same steps that are required to set up a local printer. The primary difference is that you identify a network path instead of a local port for the networked printer.
<P>
You can use the <B>Add Printer</B> icon in the <B>Printers</B> folder or Point and Print installation to install a network printer in Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<A NAME="559"><H3>Using the Add Printer Wizard</H3></A><P>
When you add a printer using the <B>Add Printer</B> icon in the Printers folder, you must specify that the printer you are adding is a network printer and provide the network path using a universal naming convention (UNC) path name for the printer. You must also select the printer manufacturer and model name. Windows&#160;98 then copies the appropriate printer driver files to the C:\Windows\system folder.
<P>
If you have applications (such as MS-DOS applications) that must print to a local port, you can also associate an LPT port with a network path by <I>capturing</I> that port. Capturing the port means that the MS-DOS program prints to the local port, where the print job is then redirected to the network printer.
<P>
<A NAME="560"><H3>Using Point and Print Installation</H3></A><P>
You can add Point and Print-enabled network printers to your computer without specifying the manufacturer and model of the printer. If you want to install a network printer using point and print, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Use <B>Network Neighborhood</B> or <B>Windows Explorer</B> to view the computer that is sharing the printer.
<P>
-Or-
<P>
Click <B>Start, Run </B>and type the UNC name of the computer that is sharing the printer.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click that computer.
<P>
<LI>	Click Start, point to Settings, and click <B>Printers</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Drag the printer icon from the computer window to your <B>Printers</B> folder.
<P>
- Or -
<P>
Right-click on the printer's icon to open its context menu and choose <B>Install</B>.
</OL>
<P>
Printers shared from Windows&#160;98 computers using file and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks are automatically Point and Print enabled. Printers shared from Windows&#160;NT servers that are installed as Windows&#160;98 print servers are also Point and Print enabled. Novell NetWare print servers require some configuration on the server to successfully use Point and Print.

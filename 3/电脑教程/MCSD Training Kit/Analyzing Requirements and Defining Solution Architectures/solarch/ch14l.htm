<A NAME="691"><H1>A Fresh Look</H1></A>

<p>As Marta bore down on him with Tim in tow, Dan assumed as calm an
air as he could. &quot;Hello there, guys. Long time no see.&quot;</p>

<p>Marta ignored both his tone and his greeting. &quot;Dan, there's
a problem, and it's just what I was afraid of! The code doesn't
work, and no one can fix it, not Tim, or Bill, or Sam, or Beth, or
Mike&#8212;and I don't know how to fix it myself! I can't handle
all of this responsibility! I can't make sure it's done
right.&quot; She was clearly exasperated. &quot;What was I thinking? I
knew I should have left when I tried, and not let everyone talk me into
staying!&quot;</p>

<p>Tim looked miserable. He corroborated Marta's judgement about
the broken code. &quot;I just don't understand it, Dan. The build
worked fine in the test lab, but when we moved it to the
multi-processor box, the response time actually went down. Now
we're getting these weird error messages. This morning, the box
actually blue-screened.&quot; He sighed. &quot;The only thing I can
think of is that there's something wrong with the SMP support. I
guess we'll have to send this box back, move RMS to a regular box,
and hope we can live with the speed.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan knew that he needed to take charge of the situation. &quot;First
of all, let's not have this conference in the hall. Come into my
office, calm down, and let's talk.&quot; He ushered Tim and Marta
into his office, shut the door, and sat with his teammates at his
conference table.</p>

<p>Dan could tell that Marta and Tim were up against some common
pitfalls of the Stabilizing Phase. &quot;I understand why you're
stressed, Marta. Trust me, everyone who works with computers has
experienced it. Because you can't see everything going on inside
the box, it can be horribly frustrating to track down problems like
this one. You can't tell whether it's the hardware, the
operating system, some obscure driver, or the software we wrote. But
getting angry just muddies your thought processes even more.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to his Network Manager. &quot;And you, Tim, are doing two
things you should never do: First, you're assuming too much, and
second, you're grasping at straws. You should know
better.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim's demeanor changed from defeated to angry, which is what Dan
wanted. &quot;What other choices do I have in a crisis like this?&quot;
he demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Dan, &quot;because I don't
have the background you and the others have had with this
experience.&quot; Tim looked somewhat mollified as Dan continued.
&quot;What I do have is more experience doing troubleshooting. If you
were a highly paid consultant, you'd have to approach problems
systematically. If someone contacted you to check out this situation in
another company, what would you want to check first?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim thought for a moment. &quot;Well&#8230;first I'd check all
the hardware. I'd make sure the hardware was on the approved
hardware list and do some research into anything about the hardware
that I thought was unusual. Then I'd try to make sure the hardware
was working properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OK,&quot; Dan said encouragingly, &quot;those are good
general-purpose things to check. Now get more specific. Describe a
specific case to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me give it a try,&quot; said Marta. Her frustration was
beginning to subside, and she was intrigued enough by the conversation
to want to contribute her natural problem-solving tendencies. &quot;We
have a custom software application that interacts with certain
services&#8212;say, MTS and SQL Server&#8212;on a Windows NT server. This
application seems to run fine on one box, but either runs poorly or not
at all on another box. The second box is an SMP box, which may or may
not have anything to do with the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I jump in here?&quot; asked Tim. Marta nodded. &quot;When
we tried to solve this problem, the box seemed to get less and less
stable, especially after the blue screen came up this
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; challenged Dan, &quot;what strategy can you come up
with for tackling this problem?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, to eliminate the SMP box as the source of the problem,
we could get another SMP box, configure it like the one we have, and
try running the application on the new one,&quot; said Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;True, but unfortunately, that means a schedule slippage
because we can't get another SMP box for at least a month,&quot;
reminded Dan. He turned to Tim. &quot;You mentioned that the box became
more and more unstable? Any clues there, or anything you could
check?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not that I can think of. We've got other SMP boxes,
and they are all very stable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything different about this one?&quot; asked Dan. &quot;The
build process, the patch levels, anything like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I checked the patches already,&quot; said Tim, &quot;and they
all looked OK, as far as I could tell. I didn't do the build&#8212;I
had one of the guys do the build when the box came in.&quot; Tim
thought for a moment. &quot;The build&#8230;I wonder if&#8230;Hey, could
I use your computer for a moment, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim hurried over to Dan's computer. &quot;Can I log you off and
log myself in?&quot; Dan nodded, and Tim logged in and opened several
Windows programs.</p>

<p>Dan and Marta watched as Tim arranged the various windows on the
screen. He scrolled through file listings and checked various file
properties. After a few minutes, he snapped his fingers.
&quot;That's it!&quot; Turning to Dan, Tim pointed at the screen.
&quot;That's the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? What's the problem?&quot; asked Marta, confused.</p>

<p>Dan thought he knew the answer, but wanted Tim to explain the
details. &quot;Come on, Tim, don't keep us in suspense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look,&quot; said Tim, activating one file window. &quot;This
is a directory on the MTS server that's already in
production.&quot; He switched to another window. &quot;And this is the
same directory on the new server. Notice anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The directories don't contain all the same files,&quot;
said Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;That's OK,&quot; said Tim. &quot;Unless two servers are
identical and loaded with exactly the same software, the directories
won't be the same. There's another way they're different,
but you can't see it in this view.&quot; He switched both windows
to a detail view and then arranged them on the screen so that all the
details were visible. &quot;Now do you notice anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some of the file dates aren't the same, even though the
file names are,&quot; said Marta. &quot;Is that important?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes it can be <i>very</i> important,&quot; said Dan,
nodding to Tim, &quot;It can mean that different versions of the
software have been installed on the two servers. Usually, that
doesn't matter. But if one program installs an older version of
a 
file that is also used by another program, the other program may not
function correctly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It can get really hairy with servers, what with patches,
add-on software, and the like,&quot; said Tim. &quot;I told my guy to
be sure the box was current and that it had all the services and
software it needed, but I never told him what order to install
everything in, or which files to keep and which ones to overwrite. I
just assumed he would know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's that 'assume' word again,&quot; said Marta,
grinning at Tim. &quot;And you know what happens when you
assume.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OK, OK, I got it,&quot; said Tim, holding up his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; asked Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;Order in doughnuts,&quot; said Dan.</p>

<p>Marta looked puzzled. Tim explained, with a wry smile, &quot;What he
means, Marta, is that he knows a Network Manager who's going to
learn not to assume anything by rebuilding a server tonight.&quot;</p>

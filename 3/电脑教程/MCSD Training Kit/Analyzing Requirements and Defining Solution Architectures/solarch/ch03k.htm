<A NAME="168"><H1>Team Introductions</H1></A>

<p>&quot;After a motivational sermonette like that, Dan, are you sure I
shouldn't stand up and sing instead?&quot; she said, smiling. Jane
proceeded to tell about her years at Ferguson and Bardell and her rise
to Director of Accounting, and to give a brief description of her areas
of responsibility. She concluded by noting that she was accountable to
the management team for all aspects of the accounting function.
&quot;So if something isn't working or it's working too slowly,
I catch it from above. That makes me highly motivated to find answers
that work.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;Good. We'll need that focus as we move
forward. Glad you're here, Jane. Marilou, how about you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I've been doing training here at Ferguson and
Bardell, and at other firms around Chicago, for about four years. Most
of my work for your firm has been teaching end-user applications such
as Office, along with a smattering of operating system classes and
such. Haven't done any technical training for Ferguson and Bardell,
though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's really good, too,&quot; Jane added. &quot;Every time
I send some of my staff to one of Marilou's training classes, they
always come back more enthusiastic about both the application and their
work. She seems to understand what's involved in their day-to-day
tasks, and is able to incorporate that into her teaching.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As any good trainer should,&quot; replied Dan. &quot;It's
that user savvy that made you a candidate for this team, Marilou. It
will be the key to your work here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And just when are we going to learn what that work is?&quot;
Bill interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;Hang on, Bill&#8212;it's items 4 and 5 on the agenda. Okay,
Tim, let's hear your life story.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim grinned. &quot;It'll be pretty short, I guess, since
I've only been here a few years. Of course,&quot; he continued,
turning to Bill, &quot;since I'm also the youngest one here, the
percentage of my life that I've spent at Ferguson and Bardell is
about the same as an old-timer like you, huh, Bill?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill grunted in reply, but his face also softened with a slight
smile. In the time Tim had been at the firm, he and Bill had had more
than one run-in, and Bill had learned that behind the boyish grin was
an excellent network and systems engineer. Improbably, Bill and Tim had
developed a fairly good relationship. In fact, Tim was one of the few
people at Ferguson and Bardell who could kid Bill Pardi and get away
with it.</p>

<p>Tim turned back to the group. &quot;Well, I came here right out of
college as the Assistant Network Manager. Basically, all that title got
me was a pager and the 'privilege' of being on call 24/7. A few
things happened along the way, and&#8212;well, I don't know, I was
just in the right place at the right time, I guess, and I wound up as
Network Manager for the entire company.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane leaned forward and looked at Tim. &quot;There's more to it
than that and you know it!&quot; Turning to Dan, she continued,
&quot;The 'few things' he's referring to happened about six
months after he got here. We had moved to NT, and it wasn't going
well at all. Tim tried to make a few suggestions, but the consultant
doing the work ignored him because he was so young. Finally, after two
weeks of the network going up and down every day, your predecessor told
the consultant and the Network Manager to step aside, turned to Tim,
and asked him, 'Can you fix it?' Tim started working, and in about
a day-and-a-half we were up, it was stable, and it's been stable
since.&quot; As Tim blushed slightly from the praise, Bill muttered
&quot;fine work&quot; under his breath.</p>

<p>Dan smiled at Tim. &quot;So, when the manager job came open last
spring, you got off third shift and onto the hot seat, right?&quot; Tim
nodded while everyone else chuckled. &quot;Well, guy, that seat may get
hotter before this project is over. But Tim, I want you to know
something: I heard about your expertise when I interviewed for this
job, and nothing I've seen since has made me think the reports were
exaggerated.&quot; Tim started blushing again until Dan added, to
general laughter all around, &quot;Just buy an alarm clock,
okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan then turned to Marta on his right. &quot;Marta, you're the
newest one here, so many of us in the room haven't even met you
before today. You're an MIT grad. What brought you to us, and what
should we know about your work and what you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I graduated with a master's in Electrical Engineering last
spring. I had already done a co-op for Ferguson and Bardell in the
Louisville office, and enjoyed both the work and the people. About a
month before I graduated, I was contacted by the Director of
Engineering here in Chicago about a job, and after some negotiations
about the job description, I accepted the job offer and began work here
in the summer.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan already knew about the negotiations Marta had mentioned, because
the Director of Engineering had recommended her to Dan in the first
place. He thought it was important for the project team to know
something of Marta's interests, though, so he asked her, &quot;Just
what issues were you negotiating, if you don't mind my
asking?&quot;</p>

<p>Marta laughed. &quot;No, it's certainly not something personal
or earth-shattering. I just told him that I wanted to be involved in
some cross-discipline project work. One of the attractions of working
for Ferguson and Bardell is the opportunity to work with architects and
project managers as well as engineers. I'm not sure yet how I want
to use my degree, so I want exposure to a wide range of issues and
projects.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you'll certainly get some of that on this
project,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Glad you're with us, Marta, and
welcome aboard.&quot; There was a murmur of agreement around the
table.</p>

<p>All eyes then turned to Bill Pardi as Dan said, &quot;Okay, Bill,
I've saved you for last. As Tim has already pointed out, you've
been here longer than any of us, and you've probably forgotten more
about technology than most of us know. As we build this team, what do
we need to know about the Chief?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill looked up, seeming not to know what to say, to be at a loss for
words. He wasn't comfortable talking about himself, at least not in
this &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; manner, and it showed. Finally,
shrugging slightly, he said, &quot;I guess being ex-military explains a
lot about me. When I went in the Navy, I was a young jerk with a big
mouth and an attitude to match. The Navy taught me that big talk had to
be backed up with big action. Ever since, I've put more stock in
getting things done than in talking about it. The Navy also taught me
about computers, and how to crank out code. Some of the projects we
did! Churning out line after line for hours, days at a time. Excuses
didn't work, talking didn't work, meetings didn't work; the
only thing that counted was how many lines you got in and compiled that
day. We built stuff that's still running today, still slamming data
through, and we put in the hours to do it. Now I can't find anyone
willing to burn some midnight oil to get projects out. It seems like it
takes longer and longer to get stuff out the door, even though this
Visual Whatever stuff is supposed to make it easier. Some days, I wish
I was back writing VAX code on a green-screen terminal, rather than
managing a bunch of mouse-clickers.&quot; Then, as if exhausted by his
sudden burst of autobiography, Bill slumped back in his chair and
stared at the conference table.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment. Finally, Dan broke the silence.
&quot;Bill, we've all felt that way, one time or another. Managing
others is often much harder than simply doing the work yourself.
I'm hoping that as we all work together on this project, the
processes and models we use will make the work of managing a little bit
easier.&quot;</p>

<p>After another pause, Jane spoke up and said, &quot;Okay, Dan,
you've put all of us on the hot seat. How about you? What brings
you to Ferguson and Bardell, and to this project that is so important,
none of us know anything about it?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan smiled at the question, and thought for a moment before
replying. &quot;Well, I came from a law firm, as you know. What you
probably don't know is that technology was not my first career
choice. I began my work life as a teacher&#8212;history, in
fact&#8212;and I'm not sure I've ever completely left that
field. I enjoy helping people: helping them learn, helping them grow,
helping them succeed. That's one of the reasons I got involved in
computers. Technology should be an enabler, not a barrier, and
that's what I want to make it. That's also how I see my job:
helping my staff and the rest of the company become more adept at their
jobs through the intelligent use of technology. Remember, technology
should never be the end; it should always be the means to the end. In
the case of Ferguson and Bardell, that end is providing the best
architecture work, engineering work, and project management to our
clients that we possibly can. The business goals should both drive and
inform our technology goals. Which brings us to MSF.&quot;</p>

<p>Once the team has completed the product's source code with the
Developing Phase's Scope Complete Milestone, the Stabilizing Phase
must prepare the product for release to the customer. As mentioned in
<A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>, the Developing Phase's Scope Complete Milestone product
release is a product that has implemented all product features and
completed basic functional testing. Although the team has been focused
on shipping the right product at the right time throughout the project,
the team should become acutely aware of this during the Stabilizing
Phase. Figure 13.1 illustrates that the Stabilizing Phase is when the
product must be completed in order to reach the Release Milestone.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 13.1</b> <i> The Stabilizing Phase and Product Release milestone</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>During the Stabilizing Phase, the team may ship multiple external
product releases while driving toward the final product release. During
these interim releases, the team will primarily focus on testing to
identify bugs, and fixing the bugs that are identified. A significant
interim milestone that signifies the team is getting close to releasing
a product is generally referred to as the zero-bug release (ZBR). ZBR
is the first interim product release in which all active bugs have been
resolved in some manner, whether fixed, postponed, or deemed
unimportant. Once an interim release is shipped, extensive testing must
occur to determine whether the product is ready, at which point the
team can declare victory and classify the release as the Final Product
Release.</p>

<p>The Stabilizing Phase is also characterized by the completion of all
the other product support elements, including user performance
artifacts, installation and configuration guides, and operations
support staff training programs. These artifacts and processes must
also be tested and released before the product can be released. Only
after all the application code and related materials are ready for
release can the team say they have reached their goal of shipping the
right product at the right time.</p>

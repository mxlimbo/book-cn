<p>Successful management of a development project requires two
important qualities. The first is <i>rigor</i>, which ensures that a
process is followed. The second is <i>flexibility</i>, which allows the
process to adapt to a changing environment. In this chapter, we first
look at two traditional models for application development: the
Waterfall Model and the Spiral Model. We then discuss another model
that is widely used today: the Unified Software Development Process (UP
or Unified Process).</p>

<p>The majority of this chapter is devoted to the MSF Process Model for
Application Development, which we call the <i>MSF Development Process
Model</i>. Rather than a step-by-step methodology, MSF is a structural
framework that an organization can adapt to suit its particular needs.
The MSF Development Process Model is the part of this framework that
describes the life cycle of a successful software development project.
This model allows a project team to respond to customer requests and to
change product direction midcourse. It also allows a team to deliver
key portions of the product faster than would otherwise be possible.
The MSF Development Process Model is a flexible component of MSF that
has been successfully proven in the software industry to improve
project control, minimize risk, improve product quality, and increase
development speed.</p>

<p>The principles and guidelines we provide in this chapter are based
on our own experience with the creation of application architectures
and the implementation of enterprise applications, as well as
information from the following sources:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> Microsoft Solutions Framework</li></p>

<p><li> Walker Royce's <i>Software Project Management: A Unified
Framework</i></li></p>

<p><li> Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson's <i>The
Unified Modeling Language User Guide</i></li></p>

<p><li> Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch, and James Rumbaugh's <i>The
Unified Software Development Process</i></li></p>

</ul>

<p><b>Upon completion, you will be able to:</b></p>

<ul>

<p><li> Understand the characteristics of the Waterfall and Spiral Models
and list their disadvantages.</li></p>

<p><li> List the workflows of the Unified Process.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify the primary models of the Unified Process.</li></p>

<p><li> List the four phases of the MSF Development Process Model.</li></p>

<p><li> Understand the benefits of versioned releases and the impact of
an iterative approach on development projects.</li></p>

<p><li> Relate team roles and responsibilities to the MSF Development
Process Model.</li></p>

<p><li> Understand the relationships between project variables and
constraints, and the concept of managing tradeoffs.</li></p>

<p><li> Analyze projects to determine goal-driven milestones.</li></p>

<p><li> Analyze development projects to determine process iteration
goals.</li></p>

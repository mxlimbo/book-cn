<p>&quot;Look at this,&quot; said Dan, pointing to the transparency.
&quot;This is the MSF Development Process Model, unrolled out of its
circle into a straight line. What does it remind you of?&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou said, &quot;Hmm&#8212;get the requirements, make a plan,
build the app, test it and deploy it.&quot; Suddenly it struck her, and
she exclaimed, &quot;Why, it's just &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Waterfall Model with another name,&quot; said Bill flatly.
&quot;I told you this MSF was just the 'same old same old' under a
new name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, Bill,&quot; said Dan, making some marks on the
transparency. He had drawn the MSF Development Process Model circle in
miniature above each of the phases on the straight line. &quot;Does
this look like the same old Waterfall?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dan, I did not understand this when I read the material you
gave us, and I do not understand it now,&quot; said Marta, clearly
puzzled. &quot;Are you saying that we do an entire turn through the
Process Model <i>within</i> each phase?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's <i>exactly</i> what I'm saying, Marta. And here
we're departing somewhat from the strict MSF way of doing
things&quot; replied Dan. &quot;In each phase, we are going to do some
Envisioning, some Planning, some Developing, and some Stabilizing. In
some phases, we might loop around more than once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do we do a miniature version of the milestones, too?&quot;
asked Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;No, this isn't like one of those photographs of two
mirrors, where the images keep repeating smaller and smaller to
infinity. These smaller iterations aren't full-blown versions of
the MSF Development Process Model, with interim deliverables inside of
interim deliverables and such.</p>


<p>&quot;All that 'iterations-within-iterations' means is that we
are planning and building throughout the project. We do some testing
and deployment early, in the Envisioning Phase, rather than wait until
the very end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; said Marilou, speaking slowly as she worked through
the idea, &quot;this means that the vision may not be complete, may not
be final, until the very end, even though it gets approved at the end
of the first phase.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Dan replied. &quot;That's the whole point
behind the Living Documents concept in your materials. All the
deliverable documents are open to revision as we go through the
project, based on new or changed information we gather along the
way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's to keep you from iterating right out of
control?&quot; asked Bill with irritation in his voice. &quot;Looks to
me like you could just do iteration after iteration until you blow away
your time and your budget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You limit the number of iterations up front,&quot; replied
Dan. &quot;And, you set goals for each iteration up front as well, so
everyone on the team knows what each iteration is supposed to
accomplish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How many iterations are we going to do in the RMS
project?&quot; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;That number is determined largely by our calendar,&quot; said
Dan. &quot;Since that's next on our agenda, let's take a look
at it.&quot; He put a new transparency on the projector. &quot;What do
you think?&quot; There was a collective gasp as the team looked at
Dan's proposed calendar.</p>

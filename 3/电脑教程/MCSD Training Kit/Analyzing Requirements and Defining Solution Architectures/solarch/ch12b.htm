<A NAME="593"><H1>Overview of the Developing Phase</H1></A>

<p>The Developing Phase is the third of the four phases of the MSF
Development Process Model. The Developing Phase follows the Planning
Phase, which is completed with the Project Plan Approved Milestone. To
this point, the team has focused on product vision, product
architecture, and project planning. During the Developing Phase, the
team's focus changes to project execution.</p>

<p>The team may ask, &quot;How can we successfully implement our
development process to ship the right product on time?&quot; The answer
to this question lies in a common understanding of the product vision.
To further enhance the development process, the team should weigh this
understanding of the vision with realistic limits for developing a
functional software product. Developers should then implement the
product defined by the project team.</p>

<p>As noted in Figure 12.1, the Development implementation leads to
application coding being completed and initially released to the
project team, resulting in the Scope Complete Milestone. This milestone
of the Developing Phase has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> All product features are implemented, even if not fully
optimized.</li></p>

<p><li> The product has passed basic testing and the current list of bugs
has been addressed, although not necessarily fixed.</li></p>

<p><li> Team members and key stakeholders agree that the included
features meet the product vision and design, and have been successfully
implemented.</li></p>

<p><li> User performance materials are baselined and ready for testing
and stabilization.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The Developing Phase contains many small similiarities to the other
phases of the MSF Process Model. For example, results of the Planning
Phase efforts would produce the following revised deliverables:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Functional Specification</li></p>

<p><li> Master Project Plan</li></p>

<p><li> Master Project Schedule</li></p>

<p><li> Master Risk Assessment Document</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Where these deliverables are the output for the Project Plan
Approved Milestone, they become the input and tools for the Developing
Phase. The Planning deliverables are used as a forecast to quantify the
implementation of the development process. These Planning deliverables
should not be viewed as completely static; they are baselined and
should be used as a guide in the Developing Phase. The deliverables for
completing the Developing Phase will include revised versions of the
Planning Phase deliverables, as well as the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Source code and executables</li></p>

<p><li> User performance materials</li></p>

<p><li> Testing elements</li></p>
</ul>



<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss how to incorporate Project Plan
Approved Milestone deliverables into the Developing Phase so that a
team can begin to create a software product and reach the Scope
Complete Milestone. Specific interim milestones can help continue the
team's progress through the Developing Phase.</p>

<p>Often called &quot;getting the real work done&quot; on a development
project, the true focus of the Developing Phase is building the product
solution.</p>

<A NAME="594"><H2>Planning Feeds the Developing Phase Deliverable</H2></A>

<p><i>Architecting</i> the product properly during the Planning Phase
provides the context to <i>implement</i> the product during the
Developing Phase. In the <i>Software Project Survival Guide</i>
(Microsoft Press, 1998), Steve McConnell describes the transition
between the two phases using the terms <i>upstream</i> and <i>
downstream</i>. Application architecture work through the Planning
Phase moves upstream, leading to the Developing Phase. Product work
implementing the design moves downstream beginning at the Developing
Phase and ending at the product release point. If a team's early
upstream work is sound, the team members know exactly what needs to be
implemented. If the upstream architecture is unsound, pieces derived
from this architecture will significantly impede the project.</p>

<p>The Master Project Schedule describes the expected implementation
schedule for the Developing Phase. The Functional Specification
provides the Conceptual, Logical, and Physical application designs, the
foundation for physical code implementation. The project's risk
assessment and management must continue to be proactively managed as
the risk's probability and impact fluctuate throughout the project.
Also during the Developing Phase, the team will implement the 
Development Plan incrementally, using interim milestones as
mentioned.</p>

<p>For example, in moving from Envisioning to Planning and into
Development, one logical architectural requirement may map to a dozen
physical design templates, which may, in turn, be able to map to
hundreds of lines of actual code. In moving from design to coding, the
team certainly can't implement all features, services, and object
code at once&#8212;the code must be implemented in manageable portions.
As each code segment is integrated, it will be combined with the others
to form the complete application.</p>

<p>Each new compilation of the application can be made available as an
interim product release during the Developing Phase. At some point
during the product development, these interim releases are made
externally available in the form of alpha and beta product
releases.</p>

<A NAME="324"><H1>Conceptual Design</H1></A>

<p>&quot;Moving right along,&quot; said Dan, looking at his agenda.
&quot;In some cases, the design process can take weeks or even months.
For RMS, we're going to try to complete it in three meetings.
Today, we've got to complete Conceptual Design to stay on schedule.
Fortunately,&quot; he continued, as Jane stood up, &quot;Jane has done
some of the work ahead of time, so we have a good chance at completing
this today.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane passed out stacks of papers to each team member. &quot;The
first step under Conceptual Design is research, which includes key
processes and activities, as well as user profiles. I gathered this
information and tried to organize it as best I could.&quot; She sat
back down. &quot;The second step is analysis, which involves reviewing
the research information and coming up with scenarios to cover all the
use cases discovered in the research step, as well as descriptions of
other data, like the physical environment in which the process takes
place. I've tried to write the scenarios, but I'm sure they
need some refinement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, Jane, this is a bunch of work!&quot; exclaimed Tim.
&quot;You've sure saved us a lot of time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marilou helped, especially with the user profiles,&quot; said
Jane.</p>

<p>Dan flipped through the well-organized documents. &quot;You both
deserve a big thanks. When I started you on this a few weeks ago, I had
no idea you'd be able to take the work this far. Excellent
job.&quot; Jane and Marilou both smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;OK, folks, let's dig into this.&quot; The team spent the
next 45 minutes working through the material and finalizing the
scenarios. At the end of that time, Dan said, &quot;That's the last
one&#8212;I think we're done,&quot; and everyone sat back,
relaxing.</p>

<p>Finally Marta said, &quot;I hate to mention this, since it seems as
if we're at a stopping point, but isn't there another step in
Conceptual Design? Something about optimization?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;Yes, there is. I'm sitting here, debating
whether or not to do it now. Let me describe it, and then you can tell
me if you think there is more work to do.&quot; Briefly, he explained
the optimization step. &quot;Do any of the scenarios need
optimization?&quot; he asked. &quot;In other words, do you want to do a
future-state version in addition to the current-state scenario we just
completed?&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, no one spoke. Then Tim said, &quot;Well, the only one
I can think of is the one for generating a time sheet. I think the
current process is unwieldy, and it could be much better. If RMS
doesn't deal with that, I think most people will see it as a
failure.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill nodded. &quot;Let's do it now, folks. Better now while the
use cases are still fresh.&quot; The team spent another 20 minutes
working through not only the time sheet scenario, but also the
scenarios for resource assignment and invoice printing.</p>

<p>Dan asked for the tenth time, &quot;Any more changes?&quot; No one
spoke up. &quot;Alright, then, we're done with that for now.&quot;
Dan pushed himself up from his chair and moved to the credenza.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean, for now? Will we have to come back and do
this again?&quot; said Tim, his voice rising slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt that we will on this project, Tim,&quot; said Dan as
he laid out stacks of material on the credenza. &quot;RMS isn't
that complex, even though it <i>is</i> important. But there is always
the possibility that we'll learn something later that will force us
to come back and redo this part. If we have to, we have to. Remember,
we'd rather spend the time getting it right in the Planning Phase
than starting over Developing or Stabilizing.&quot; Dan finished
putting out material and turned to the group. &quot;Here's your
reading material for the weekend. It explains Logical Design and
Physical Design in greater detail. Be sure to read it before Monday
morning's meeting. And for those of you who haven't yet read
the first set, you need to read that, too, just so you're on the
same page as the rest of us.&quot; He looked pointedly at Tim.</p>

<p>&quot;It's going to be a long weekend,&quot; sighed Tim, putting
his head down on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Not for me,&quot; said Bill, standing to gather his things.
&quot;I'm going <i>fishing</i>.&quot; He patted Tim on the shoulder
as he moved to the credenza to pick up his material. &quot;I'll
just prop that pole on the transom, prop my feet on the rail, and read
this stuff while I catch my limit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like a plan, Chief,&quot; said Dan, handing material to
the others as they left. &quot;By the way, don't forget our meeting
Monday afternoon with the EA team.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't hardly wait&#8212;and I hope you caught the double
negative.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see he's met Kevin Kennedy,&quot; said Marilou to Jane
as they walked out of the room.</p>

<A NAME="246"><H1>RMS Project Calendar and Initial Goals</H1></A>

<p>&quot;Boy, when you said two months, you weren't kidding, were
you?&quot; said Bill. He continued, &quot;Do you honestly think there
is any way we can make these deadlines?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, we won't know the definitive answer to that until we
get further into the planning process. Remember, scheduling belongs in
the Planning Phase. But we can set up a high-level, tentative schedule
now, simply to give us a framework on which to base our planning.
That's what I've done here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's see,&quot; said Jane, as she sketched the calendar
on her notepad. &quot;Looks like you've got a week and a half for
Envisioning, another week and a half for Planning, three weeks for
Developing, and two weeks for Stabilizing. I bet that boils down to one
iteration for Envisioning, one for Planning, two for Developing, and
one for Stabilizing. How close am I?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan smiled and said, &quot;Exactly right, Jane. Your accounting
background serves you well.&quot;</p>

<p>Marta asked, &quot;What about the goals for each iteration, Dan? You
mentioned we needed to set those up front.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and I've got a tentative set of goals right
here,&quot; Dan answered as he handed out a paper diagram to the team.
Looking at the copy in front of him, Dan continued, &quot;I've
listed the development goals for each iteration first, as those are
probably the easiest to grasp.</p>

<p>&quot;In the first iteration&#8212;the one done during the
Envisioning Phase&#8212;our development goal is to build a prototype. A
prototype is a visual mock-up of what we think the app should look
like. It is a tool for communicating with the customer, and is only the
interfaces. Bill, do you think your team can do a prototype in roughly
a week?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With all the visual tools we have, are you kidding? Interfaces
we can do,&quot; said Bill.</p>

<p>&quot;Great. So our primary goal for the first iteration is to build
the prototype and use it as a vehicle to create a vision of what the
RMS product can be. Now, on to the iteration done within the Planning
Phase. Here, our development goal is to build a proof-of-concept
version of the application. This version is where we work out the
critical design and architecture questions, and prove that our design
is doable. The proof-of-concept version is almost the functional
opposite of the prototype. The prototype was all interfaces; the
proof-of-concept is all the critical guts of the app: data access,
back-end products, things like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I get it,&quot; said Bill, warming to the discussion.
&quot;Then in the iterations done during the Developing Phase, we build
an alpha version and a beta version of the application, right?
That's just like we've done before, <i>but</i> &quot;&#8212;Bill
was beginning to get excited&#8212;&quot;this time our alpha is really
way ahead because of the work we've already done! We can simply
take the interfaces from the prototype and the technical design of the
proof-of-concept and put them together with some connecting objects.
Using this MSF Development Process Model, our alpha will be almost like
our first beta in past projects.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly, Bill. You've got the idea,&quot; said Dan.
&quot;Then, in our final iteration, we incorporate any issues that
Testing and Logistics have found, and we're at our golden release.
And then we're done.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone was silent for a moment. Finally, Jane spoke up.
&quot;Well, if I'm going to start driving this process forward, I
guess the first question is, where do we go from here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good question, Jane,&quot; Dan replied. &quot;That's the
Path-Forward Assignments at the end of the agenda. Before we go there,
let's see if anyone has a question.&quot; He paused. After a
moment, Tim raised his hand. &quot;Yes, Tim?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim said, &quot;Dan, this looks great. I mean, the idea of turning a
project this quickly is so exciting, I know <i>I</i> am already pumped.
But, it's also a pretty radical departure from our past practices,
and I'm still struggling to get a handle on it. I bet the others
are, too.&quot; There were nods of agreement around the table. Tim
continued, &quot;Do you have any examples of this process, any sample
documents, for instance? Something showing how a particular team laid
out its goals would be helpful.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded and said, &quot;Tim, one of the best ways to understand
the MSF Development Process Model and the iterations within it is to
watch another project team work through it. That's why the handouts
I've prepared this time are the deliverable documents from another
team's project. I happen to know the program manager on that
project, and he said I could share them with you.&quot;</p>

<p>As Dan said this he began to smile, and Tim exclaimed,
&quot;<i>You</i> were the program manager! These are documents from
your old law firm!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and I haven't cleaned them up very much, so
you'll get to see just how green I was then,&quot; said Dan.
&quot;We were all new at it, but we were still able to turn a project
in six months when most people thought it would take three years.
Granted, we wound up doing two more versions over the next year before
we got the application where we wanted it, but we still delivered the
core functionality in the first version. I got permission from the
directing officer of the law firm to share these with you, and I hope
that they help you get a grasp of these concepts.&quot;</p>

<p>He noticed that Marta seemed troubled. &quot;Marta, you look like
something is bothering you. Is there something I can clear
up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not right now. I want to look over the documents you
mentioned; then I may want to come and talk with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone noticed the tone of her voice, but Dan decided to act as if
he hadn't. &quot;That's fine. My door is always open to you or
anyone on this team. Just stop by, and we can set something up.&quot;
She nodded and remained silent.</p>

<p>Dan turned back to the group. &quot;Any other questions? No? Then
let's move on to our Path-Forward assignments.</p>


<p>&quot;Everyone should pick up a set of documents from the box on the
credenza and read them before our next meeting on Wednesday morning.
Based on your reading and on what you know of RMS at this point, each
of you should come up with at least one goal for your area for each
iteration. I want you to e-mail those goals to me by tomorrow morning
so that I can give you some feedback on them before the Wednesday
meeting. They won't be our final goals, but they'll be a
start.</p>


<p>&quot;Bill, you need to line up people to help you with the
prototype. We'll want to start it after the work we do on
Wednesday. And Jane, would you stay for just a moment? I want to
explain use cases to you, so you can work on them for the next meeting.
Everyone understand? Okay, we're done. Next meeting is Wednesday
morning, same time and place. Marilou, your turn for the doughnuts,
okay?&quot;</p>

<p>As the meeting broke up, Dan couldn't help but notice the
contrast between Marta and the rest of the team. Everyone was talking
about RMS, sharing ideas, discussing possible goals, getting excited
about the work&#8212;everyone, that is, except Marta. After picking up
her packet from the credenza, she had looked at the others for a moment
before walking silently out of the room. Dan thought, &quot;Great! Just
when I finally get Bill Pardi to buy in, I get a new problem on the
horizon. I sure hope she talks to me before the next meeting so we can
deal with whatever it is.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she didn't. As a result, the meeting on Wednesday
took a direction no one could have anticipated.</p>

<A NAME="670"><H1>Project Review Considerations</H1></A>

<p>Most project reviews have several common characteristics. Though not
exhaustive, the following list identifies several issues that teams
should consider when planning project reviews:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Timing</li></p>

<p><li> Formality</li></p>

<p><li> Length</li></p>

<p><li> Setting</li></p>

<p><li> Attendees</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="671"><H3>When to Conduct a Project Review</H3></A>

<p>A post-project review should logically take place after a project is
completed. However, the process of analyzing and learning from
completed work is valuable at any stage of a project. The major project
milestones presented by the MSF Development Process, particularly after
the Developing Phase's Scope Complete Milestone, are also
appropriate times to apply project review principles and conduct formal
project reviews.</p>

<p>While no rules dictate when to schedule an end-of-project review,
it's best to conduct it within a short time after the project is
complete. If the review is scheduled too soon, team members tend to
focus their discussions too heavily on the latter part of the project.
Additionally, the team members may still feel emotionally and mentally
too close to the project to analyze it objectively. If the review is
postponed for too long, the team is likely to forget the project's
specific details. Additionally, after extremely long periods, the
project's difficult and frustrating elements tend to fade in their
significance.</p>

<p>Table 14.2 provides several simple recommendations for how long to
wait after the product ships to conduct a project review, while
considering various project characteristics.</p>

<A NAME="672"><H3>Formality of Project Reviews</H3></A>

<p>Project review formality can vary from project to project. A small
group can meet to informally discuss project issues, or a formal
project review team can research these issues closely, and then present
a set of organized results.</p>

<p>Ideally, a project review should be a formal, well-planned event
with a set of objectives, a specific meeting agenda, and a well-defined
process. Although helpful in building morale, informal project review
meetings tend not to capture optimal best-practice lessons crucial to
project review success.</p>

<p>Because participants arrive prepared, formal project reviews also
enable teams to focus discussion on learning points, as opposed to
turning the project review into an unfocused complaint session.</p>

<A NAME="673"><H3>Time Frames for the Review Process</H3></A>

<p>While project reviews often involve meetings and daylong events,
it's ideal to keep a single review meeting to two hours or less.
Setting an appropriate time frame for a project review may involve
separating the process into a series of several meetings. In this way,
each meeting may focus on a particular area or point in the
project's development process. It is important to note that much of
the review preparation work should be done before the actual
meeting.</p>

<A NAME="674"><H3>Proper Settings for Reviews</H3></A>

<p>Conducting project reviews in an appropriate physical environment
will have a positive impact on review success and team morale.
Arranging a room with a round table or circle of tables is suggested,
as this arrangement allows team members to communicate on an equal
level with one another, with no individual dominating &quot;the head of
the table.&quot; The room should be large enough to comfortably seat
all team members; if conflict is likely, the room should allow extra
space, as feeling cramped can elevate bad feelings among teammates.</p>

<p>A blame-free environment is crucial for targeting the real project
issues. If people feel threatened, they'll put their energy into
defending themselves rather than honestly examining the project's
strengths and weaknesses objectively. The focus should remain on the
development process and team actions as a whole, not on individual
participants in the project.</p>

<A NAME="675"><H3>Who Should Attend?</H3></A>

<p>Typically, anyone involved in the project&#8212;even if only for a
small percent of the time&#8212;should participate in the project
review. If at all possible, it's ultimately most beneficial to
gather all team members for the project review process to allow
everyone involved to have input.</p>

<p>However, if inviting all team members makes the review group
inconveniently large, a suggested alternative is conducting
mini-project reviews by dividing people into groups responsible for
specific project elements. Representatives from each mini-project
review can then attend a final, comprehensive project review.</p>

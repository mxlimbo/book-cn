<A NAME="309"><H1>Ongoing Risk Management Process</H1></A>

<p>During the Envisioning Phase, the team began identifying and
managing risks using the five-step process shown in Figure 6.12. As
part of the Vision Approved Milestone, the Master Risk Assessment
Document was prepared. This document was fairly high-level, because in
the Envisioning Phase, the details of the project had not yet been
worked out.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 6.12</b> <i> Five steps of risk management</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>One deliverable for the Planning Phase is a revised version of the
Master Risk Assessment Document. At this point in the project, the team
is ready to work through the risk management process again, adding
necessary details to the plan and perhaps changing some of the original
assessments. As the team moves through the project, it will continue to
loop through the risk management process, retiring some risks,
controlling others, and even identifying new ones. In fact, when the
revised Master Risk Assessment Document is complete, it's a good
idea to include a risk management section in each subsequent meeting
agenda. Doing so ensures that the team will continue to use the five
steps shown in Figure 6.12 to manage risk.</p>

<p>When creating the original risk document in the Envisioning Phase,
the team identified as many risks as possible. As part of its analysis,
the team calculated each risk's <i>exposure rating</i> by
multiplying the risk's <i>probability</i> by its <i>impact</i>. The
team also developed preliminary plans to address the Top Ten risks,
based on that analysis. For each plan, the team considered five key
areas:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Research</b> Do we know enough about the risk?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Acceptance</b> Can we live with its consequences?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Avoidance</b> Can we avoid the risk?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Mitigation</b> Can we reduce the probability or impact?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Contingency</b> What can we do of the risk is realized?</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The team then developed subplans either to mitigate the risk or to
create contingency trigger values and strategies if the risk
occurred.</p>

<p>The problem with the risk management approach of some project teams
is that they create a risk management plan and then believe that their
work is done. In fact, the risk tracking and risk control steps are
just as critical to risk management as the risk action planning step,
and are the key steps during the Planning Phase of a project.</p>

<p>After creating the Master Risk Assessment Document, the team should
begin tracking the status of the various risks and progress as far as
controlling each risk is concerned. For each risk, the team should
ask:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Have we done anything to mitigate the risk?</li></p>

<p><li> Has the risk changed due to forces outside our control?</li></p>

<p><li> As a result of either our efforts or outside forces, has there
been a change in either the probability or the impact of the risk?</li></p>

<p><li> If anything has changed, what is the corresponding change in the
risk's exposure rating and therefore in its priority?</li></p>

<p><li> Have any of the contingency triggers been
&quot;pulled&quot;?</li></p>

<p><li> Based on the above, what should be our response?</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The risk tracking step leads to the risk control step, in which the
project team reacts to the tracked changes. This reaction may include
new mitigation plans, activation of contingency plans, re-analysis of
the risk, or retirement of the risk if the risk has occurred or been
resolved.</p>

<p>Risk management is an ongoing, dynamic process. Practicing risk
management throughout the project is a vital part of the MSF approach
to project management.</p>

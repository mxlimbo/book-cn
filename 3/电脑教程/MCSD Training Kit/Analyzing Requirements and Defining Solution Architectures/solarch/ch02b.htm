<A NAME="76"><H1>Features of Enterprise Applications</H1></A>

<p>An enterprise application is a business application, but more
specifically, it is a <i>big</i> business application. In today's
corporate environment, enterprise applications are complex, scalable,
distributed, often component-based, and mission-critical. They may be
deployed on a variety of platforms across corporate networks,
intranets, or the Internet. They are data-centric and they typically
meet stringent requirements for security, administration, and
maintenance. In short, they are highly complex systems.</p>

<p>Designing and developing enterprise applications means meeting many
separate requirements. Every development decision made to satisfy a
requirement affects many other requirements, often in ways that are
difficult to understand or predict. The failure to meet <i>any</i> of
these requirements can mean the failure of the entire project!</p>

<p>Like any modern application, an enterprise application should be
reliable and perform well, in addition to providing an intuitive and
efficient user interface. But beyond these common qualities, it can be
characterized by these three specific attributes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Complex</b> It is a multi-user, multi-developer,
multi-component application that can utilize substantial data, employ
extensive parallel processing, affect network-distributed resources,
and require complex logic. It can be deployed across multiple platforms
and inter-operate with many other applications, and it is
long-lived.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Business-oriented</b> Its purpose is to meet specific business
requirements. It encodes business policies, processes, rules, and
entities; is developed in a business organization; and is deployed in a
manner responsive to business needs.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Mission-critical</b> It is robust enough to sustain continuous
operation. It must be extremely flexible for scalability and
deployment, and allow for efficient maintenance, monitoring, and
administration.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>These qualities clearly make the task of enterprise development
challenging, and the trend is toward ever-increasing demands. The rapid
improvement of computer hardware and software, combined with global
economic competition&#8212;and opportunities&#8212;has created an
environment in which business systems must respond quickly and deliver
unparalleled levels of performance. As these demands continue,
organizations must automate even more of their processes, build their
software even faster, serve more and more users, and process a rapidly
growing mass of data.</p>

<p>Aside from these challenges, the power, complexity, and rate of
change of the technology used in building these corporate solutions
make efficient development ever more difficult. Designing an enterprise
application requires the weighing and balancing of an enormous array of
application requirements, such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Its business goals.</li></p>

<p><li> How soon it must be delivered.</li></p>

<p><li> Its budget.</li></p>

<p><li> The number of people who will develop, test, and maintain
it.</li></p>

<p><li> The number of concurrent users it must support.</li></p>

<p><li> The importance of performance and ease of use.</li></p>

<p><li> The hardware it must run on.</li></p>

<p><li> Where it will be deployed.</li></p>

<p><li> What security is required.</li></p>

<p><li> How long it will be used.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Without a systematic way to understand the relationships among these
complex and often conflicting requirements, it's hard to know where
to begin. What is needed is a straightforward method of reducing this
complexity and providing an organized way to design and build
applications that chart an optimum course among the many
requirements.</p>

<A NAME="281"><H1>Communicating the Vision</H1></A>

<p>After the team has created the first draft of its Vision Document,
it's time to start communicating the vision, obtaining buy off from
upper management, incorporating other people's expertise, and
getting everyone excited about delivering on the vision's promises.
This process involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Validating the vision</b> The team should review the vision
with everyone inside and outside the group. This is a time to gather
feedback, verify agreement, incorporate the feedback into the next
revision of the vision, and justify why issues are not incorporated
into this product vision, as appropriate.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Selling the vision</b> The Vision Document should be reviewed
with the key players so that they understand why the product is
important and what it will do for them. Additionally, they should
understand that only the features that are part of the vision will be
included in the product. This is a good opportunity to reinforce
stakeholder training about tradeoff decisions, prioritize feature sets,
and determine product versioning. This multi-stage communication should
begin with those who have the most knowledge about the product's
area, and should work outward to other more tangential groups and
stakeholders.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Communication is a two-way street. The team
should continually incorporate stakeholders' feedback into the
vision. Team members should not only tell stakeholders what the product
will do, but should continually validate that the product meets the
stakeholders' needs.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>During validation and selling of the vision, the team creates
revised drafts of the vision document. When the team believes it is
time to move on to the planning process, the product vision is agreed
upon by the team and stakeholders, and the Vision Approved Milestone is
reached. This milestone is the identification of a baseline vision that
will be used throughout this release of the product. Although the
baseline vision may undergo slight changes during the remaining project
phases, they nevertheless constitute a foundation for this product
release.</p>

<p>At this stage of the envisioning process, it's important to
remember that the vision does not belong to any one person. To deliver
the vision, the team must own it, not a single individual. The whole
team must nurture the product vision to life, so the whole team must
clearly understand and be committed to it.</p>

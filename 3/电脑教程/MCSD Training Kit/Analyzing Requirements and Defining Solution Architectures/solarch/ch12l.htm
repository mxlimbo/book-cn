<p>He turned to Tim. &quot;Let's jump to you, big boy. Have you
helped take down any more servers?&quot; He ducked as Tim threw a
doughnut hole his way.</p>

<p>&quot;No I haven't, and you can be sure I'm keeping Bill and
all his minions as far from the production servers as possible,&quot;
said Tim testily.</p>

<p>&quot;What's this all about?&quot; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a lab class for our Network Manager and our Development
Director, with a helping hand from your boss,&quot; said Dan, grinning.
&quot;I think everyone involved learned something, and that's all
we need to say about it.&quot; Turning serious, he asked, &quot;How is
the new testing lab coming, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we don't have the new machines in yet, but we've
taken some spare equipment and moved it up there,&quot; Tim said.
&quot;And I've got one of my folks up there today doing some wiring
and set up. If the new machines come in next week like we think, they
should be up and ready for the first beta.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent, Tim. Hope the timing works out.&quot; Dan looked at
his notes, then asked, &quot;How is the operational support
documentation coming?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim looked stricken. &quot;Oops &#8230; I knew there was something
I'd forgotten.&quot; He said humbly, &quot;Sorry, Dan&#8212;I
haven't touched it.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;That's OK, Tim; you've still got plenty of
time, and actually, you can't do your documentation until the test
system is up and running and the development team freezes the
deployment.&quot; Making a note on his planner, he continued,
&quot;Assuming they hit their schedule, you'll need to have a draft
of the support documentation in two weeks. Can you do that?&quot; Tim
nodded.</p>

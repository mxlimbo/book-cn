<A NAME="177"><H1>Spiral Model</H1></A>

<p>More recent management techniques have resulted in an iterative
approach to application development known as the Spiral Model, as seen
in Figure 4.2. The stages of application development that make up this
model are typically characterized as:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> <b>Inception</b> Application planning and analysis</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Elaboration</b> Application design</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Construction</b> Application implementation</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Transition</b> Application assessment and stabilization</li></p>

</ul>

<p>Walker Royce in <i>Software Project Management: A Unified
Framework</i> notes that each stage typically involves five activity
phases: requirements, design, implementation, deployment, and
management. The Spiral Model's process is a continual circle
through the stages of development, with each stage requiring multiple
revolutions through the five phases. For example, the inception stage
may require four iterations through the five RSIDM phases. The
development life cycle is designed to define the product more tightly
over time so that each iteration brings the product closer to the point
of delivery.</p>

<p>Like the Waterfall Model, the Spiral Model can run into problems,
such as the following:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> <b>Feature postponement</b> Complex features&#8212;important to the
customer and users&#8212;are moved to later iterations of the project.
Postponing important features delays and decreases the project's
ROI.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Never-ending projects</b> Individuals and organizations need to
reach closure on projects, but a project can take on a life of its own,
with work being done solely for the sake of the project, and not
directed toward achieving business goals. If the project's business
goals change after multiple project iterations, there is a tendency for
team members to continue to work to get the next feature set completed,
without addressing the changed goals. But the changing business goals
directly affect the viability of the project, and best practices are
often lost if those goals are not addressed.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Unknown costs</b> The continual iteration, which moves and
postpones features, makes feature cost/benefit analysis difficult. The
historical costs and benefits of the project are difficult to identify
and use for future project justification.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>No sense of stability</b> When systems are in a constant state
of flux, the customer and users often feel that the product is
unstable. Constant updating requires additional resources for product
maintenance and significantly increases product deployment costs.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Lack of automation</b> Most organizations fail to invest
adequate capital in the automation of the software development process.
Significant up-front costs for automation and productivity tools are
viewed as project expenses rather than capital investment. Without an
automated development process, however, the number of iterations
required to deliver a product can significantly delay its ship dates.
Additionally, when the product is ready for deployment, lack of
automated software deployment tools makes it difficult to continually
update all users' computers with new product versions.</li></p>

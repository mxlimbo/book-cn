<A NAME="689"><H1>Case Study 10 -- Shipping RMS</H1></A>


<p>Dan poked his head around the corner of the cubicle where Marta,
Mike, and Tim were working. &quot;How many bugs today, Marta?&quot;</p>

<p>Harried, Marta glanced at him briefly. &quot;Eleven.&quot; She
returned to her work.</p>

<p>&quot;Top five still the same?&quot; He hated to keep interrupting
her, but at this stage of the project, he felt confronting her now was
more effective than setting up a formal meeting later.</p>

<p>&quot;Still the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop by before you leave today, OK?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got it.&quot; She kept her focus on the screen.</p>

<p>Dan left the testing area and headed back to his office. Some
managers might have been offended, but he had been through similar
levels of stress in earlier projects. &quot;End-game is a pretty good
name for this stage of a project,&quot; he thought. He had played some
chess growing up, and he could still remember the intense concentration
involved in the final moves to checkmate, as he tried to reach his goal
without letting his opponent sneak up on him. &quot;We know the moves
we want to make, and we're trying to make them. What we don't
know is whether or not a bug is going to rear up and bite us.&quot;</p>

<p>The team had reached bug convergence three days earlier.
Fortunately, RMS was a small enough project that hitting bug
convergence wasn't difficult, even considering the pilot release in
progress. The test team had quickly discovered around 20 bugs, which
the development team had reduced to 10 in one day. Subsequently, the
rate of bug discovery had slowed substantially, although everyone by
this point had begun to feel pressure to finalize the project.</p>

<p>However, during the past two days, the team hadn't made much
progress at all in resolving the project's outstanding issues. In
fact, no one could determine the causes of the top five bugs. Most
frustrating was that several bugs seemed linked to the new server
purchased exclusively for RMS.</p>

<p>When he got to his office, Dan checked the project charts on the
wall. He had hoped they could reach the zero-bug release deadline by
Thursday, but meeting that deadline was becoming less and less likely.
Until now, the project team hadn't used any buffer time; maybe it
was necessary now to take some buffer time from the bank.
&quot;It's too soon to decide,&quot; Dan told himself. &quot;Wait
till you see what Marta and the developers work out today.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="639"><H1>Release Milestone and Its Deliverables</H1></A>

<p>Achieving the Release Milestone is the final goal for the project
team. It marks the point where the team has finished all work on the
product, so the product, product elements, and product artifacts are
ready to be shipped. This is also the transition point at which the
team relinquishes ownership of the application and the operations and
support organization takes over for deployment, maintenance, and
ongoing product support. At the project level, the Release Milestone
signifies that the team has accomplished the project-level vision for
the product. Don't forget, this milestone is also a time for
celebration&#8212;the goal has been reached.</p>

<p>When the Stabilizing Phase is complete, the project team reaches the
Release milestone. The deliverables of this milestone provide valuable
information for the deployment and use of the application in the
production environment.</p>

<p>The six deliverables required to meet the Release Milestone are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Final product release</b> The source code and executables, as
described above.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Product release notes</b> The documents containing release
information and late changes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>User and support performance artifacts</b> The final release of
supporting information.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Testing results</b> The bug status and database for future
projects.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Project archives</b> All relevant product information created
during the development process, whether or not it shipped with the
product.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Project documents</b> All stages of the product documentation
including the major milestone releases.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="640"><H2>Release Notes</H2></A>

<p>Every product seems to have a set of last-minute changes or issues
that the customer, user, and their support teams should be aware of.
Creating a simple document that outlines these issues and acts to
communicate important application or compatibility issues can help to
alleviate problems that may be encountered by the product deployment
team.</p>

<A NAME="641"><H2>User and Support Performance Artifacts</H2></A>

<p>The user performance artifacts can take many forms such as Help
files, wizards, how-to guides, and training materials. The primary
focus of these user performance artifacts is twofold: to prepare the
user community for the product release, and to assist the user
community after the product release. Creating and releasing a product
that the user does not know how to use, does not know how to learn to
use, and does not know who to learn from can turn even the most
successful project into a disaster. The following sections discuss some
of the primary responsibilities of the User Education team:</p>

<A NAME="642"><H3>Application Documentation</H3></A>

<p>The key to a well-accepted deployment lies in the documentation an
organization provides for its users. The project team might want to
announce in advance that the application is nearing completion and to
give those curious users a location where they might find some
preliminary material to read. It's crucial that documentation is in
place and ready to be accessed when this location is announced. The
documentation may be in paper form, or it may be posted on a Web site
for easy accessibility.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to precede the full documentation with a page
highlighting the application's main capabilities. When the project
team is about a quarter of the way through deployment, it might want to
post a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document to the Web site. The
FAQ should be updated on a regular basis. When compiling the FAQ, the
team might want to ask users to submit samples of documents they intend
to use with the application and then gear the FAQ to those samples.
This involvement gives users a feeling of participation in the
process.</p>

<A NAME="643"><H3>Training and Training Documentation</H3></A>

<p>As part of the stabilizing process, the project team can implement a
training plan with documentation. This training may be self-paced
training, formal classroom training, or informal one-on-one training,
depending on the size of the deployment and the complexity of the
application. Whether the initial training is formal or informal,
additional training should follow after the user community has used the
application.</p>

<A NAME="644"><H3>Support Documentation</H3></A>

<p>System documentation can have multiple parts, depending on the
application. Server-based documentation may be required if the
application consists of a database engine and data. This documentation
can be broken down into specific documents containing the changes and
updates to the installation, system configurations, and ongoing
configuration. For example, a document describing the disaster recovery
process for the database should be created. (Disaster recovery might
consist of an automatic process that stops the database engine during
low access periods and copies the data to a backup location.) It is
also appropriate to document the usage of an enterprise utility to back
up the database. Waiting until a failure to verify a backup and
restoration plan is highly inadvisable.</p>

<p>Depending on the architecture of the application, tuning
opportunities may arise on multi-tier systems as the application enters
the production environment. These tuning parameters should be tested
during the interim releases, and the tuning suggestions and methodology
should be incorporated in the system documentation. The team should
provide a matrix or table format in the documentation to summarize
these tuning parameters.</p>

<p>Client documentation should also be created that contains the
specifics of how the application installation on the client is
performed and the default settings made during the installation. This
support document should be created during the Developing Phase and
finalized during the Stabilizing Phase. Any modifications to the
default installation should be noted in this documentation.
Additionally, for a multi-layer application, it may be advantageous to
create a high-level document describing how the three layers
interact.</p>

<A NAME="645"><H2>Testing Results</H2></A>

<p>The application's testing results should be collected and stored
in a permanent archive. These results may be used to determine new
features for new product versions, as well as to lend help to the
support and maintenance teams.</p>

<A NAME="646"><H2>Project Archives</H2></A>

<p>The project's artifacts as well as the final deliverables for
each product milestone should be permanently archived. These artifacts
may be used to set guidelines for future projects and also to provide a
historical record of this application's 
development process.</p>

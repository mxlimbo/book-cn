<A NAME="263"><H1>Risk Management Process</H1></A>

<p>A key factor in the success of any application development project
is the identification of the risks a project might encounter, and the
development of a system for managing those risks should they
materialize during the project's life cycle. We include a
discussion of risk management in this chapter because it begins in the
Envisioning Phase. However, the process of managing risks continues
throughout the entire project.</p>

<p>Many IT professionals have misconceptions about risk management. At
best, they think it is a necessary but boring task to be carried out at
the beginning of a project before the real work of writing code begins.
At worst, they think it is another form of bureaucratic red tape that
prevents the organization from achieving its objectives. Every project
has its risks, and taking risks is essential to progress. However, that
doesn't mean that attempting to recognize and manage risks is a
useless activity or that it will stifle creativity.</p>

<p>Risk is the <i>possibility of suffering loss</i>. For a given
project, this loss could be in the form of:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Diminished product quality.</li></p>

<p><li> Increased costs.</li></p>

<p><li> Missed deadlines.</li></p>

<p><li> Complete failure to achieve the project's goals.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Because risk is a problem waiting to happen, not one that has
occurred, effective risk management is a dynamic process rather than a
static project management chore.</p>

<p>Team members usually know the risks associated with their project,
but often communicate these risks poorly. Typically, communicating
risks down the chain of command is easy, but communicating risks up the
chain of command is difficult. At every level, people want to know the
risks identified at the lower levels, but are wary of communicating the
risks they have identified to the people above them. For the risk
management process to succeed, the organization must create an
environment in which people who identify and communicate project risks
are safe from retribution. In a &quot;don't shoot the
messenger&quot; environment, team members feel free to express
tentative or controversial views, which significantly improves the
scope and quality of risk management.</p>

<p>On some projects, reporting new risks can be viewed as a form of
complaining or troublemaking. Often the reaction to the risks is seen
as a problem with the person making the report rather than a problem
with the product. If the organization's unspoken message is to
&quot;soften the risk,&quot; critical information that would result in
better risk mitigation and contingency plans might be stifled.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Remember that risk is the possibility, not
the certainty, of loss. Team members might erroneously view a project
with a list of 15 to 20 identified risks with skepticism, even though
the total risk exposure is modest.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="264"><H2>Sources of Risk</H2></A>

<p>Effective project risk management must take into consideration the
business environment in which the project will be carried out. Many IT
projects fail not because of faulty technology or bad project
management, but because larger organizational pressures were ignored.
These organizational pressures come in many forms, such as competition,
financial health, and organizational culture. Potential risk sources
include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Mission and goals.</li></p>

<p><li> Decision drivers.</li></p>

<p><li> Organization management.</li></p>

<p><li> Customer and users.</li></p>

<p><li> Budget and costs.</li></p>

<p><li> Schedule.</li></p>

<p><li> Project characteristics.</li></p>

<p><li> Development process.</li></p>

<p><li> Development environment.</li></p>

<p><li> Personnel.</li></p>

<p><li> Operational environment.</li></p>

<p><li> New technology.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Possible consequences for the project include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Cost overruns.</li></p>

<p><li> Schedule slips.</li></p>

<p><li> Inadequate functionality.</li></p>

<p><li> Project cancellation.</li></p>

<p><li> Sudden personnel changes.</li></p>

<p><li> Customer dissatisfaction.</li></p>

<p><li> Damage to the organization's image.</li></p>

<p><li> Demoralized staff.</li></p>

<p><li> Poor product performance.</li></p>

<p><li> Legal proceedings.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>It is important to remember that different types of projects pose
different kinds of risks, and each project's risks must be
addressed individually.</p>

<A NAME="265"><H2>Types of Risk Management</H2></A>

<p>Risk management can be approached in three ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Waving the magic wand</b> The project team assesses the risks
only once during initial project planning. Major risks are identified,
but are never explicitly reviewed or acted upon.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Reactive</b> The project team reacts to the consequences of
risks (actual problems) as they occur.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Proactive</b> The project team has a visible process for
managing risks that is measurable, repeatable, and addresses the
conditions that cause the risks.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Obviously the &quot;magic wand&quot; approach is not an example of
good risk management. But neither is the reactive approach, because it
has no prevention component. Preventing the risks identified for a
project from materializing is the hallmark of a good risk management
process. Prevention begins in the Envisioning Phase and continues until
the product is released at the end of the Stabilizing Phase. For most
risks, the goal is to take certain actions to prevent the risks from
materializing as problems, as well as to determine in advance what
actions will be taken if a particular risk does in fact materialize. To
reach mature levels of proactive risk management, the project team must
be able to unemotionally evaluate the risks and take actions that
address their root causes, not just their symptoms.</p>

<p>It's important to emphasize that no matter how good a job the
team does of risk assessment, it is the team's ability to manage
risks that will be a determining factor in the project's
success.</p>

<p>The risk management process consists of proactive decisions and
actions that continually:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Assess what risks might occur.</li></p>

<p><li> Determine what risks need to be acted upon.</li></p>

<p><li> Specify what strategies should be implemented to mitigate those
risks.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>An effective project team assesses risks throughout the life cycle
of the project and uses them for decision-making in all project phases.
As shown in Figure 5.2, the team carries the risks forward until either
they are resolved or they turn into problems and are handled as
such.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 5.2</b> <i> Proactive risk management process</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<A NAME="266"><H2>Step #1: Risk Identification</H2></A>

<p>Risk identification is the first step in the proactive risk
management process. Risks must be identified before they can be
managed. Risk identification provides the opportunities, cues, and
information that allow the team to expose the major risks that might
adversely affect the project.</p>

<p>To identify risks, team members and key stakeholders hold a series
of brainstorming and open discussions to identify and rank the risks
for the project. To facilitate this process, risk factors can be
grouped by focus area, such as custom software development,
infrastructure deployment, packaged software deployment, enterprise
architecture planning, and component-based development. Within each
focus area, risk factors can be further grouped into categories, such
as mission and goals factors, decision drivers, organizational
management factors, and budget and cost factors.</p>

<p>For example, Table 5.2 identifies three mission and goals risk
factors. Each factor has low, medium, and high risk cues. If the low
risk cue is in evidence for the project fit risk factor, the project
directly supports the customer's mission and goals; if the
factor's high risk cue is in evidence, the project does not support
or relate to the customer's mission and goals.</p>

<p><b>Table 5.2</b> <i>Sample risk factors chart</i></p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Risk factor   </th>
<th>Low risk cue  </th>
<th>Medium risk cue  </th>
<th>High risk cue  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Project fit   </td>
<td valign="top">Directly supports customer's mission and goals</td>
<td valign="top">Indirectly impacts one or more goals </td>
<td valign="top">Does not support or relate to customer's mission or goals  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Customer perception </td>
<td valign="top">Expects team to provide this product </td>
<td valign="top">Believes team is not working on expected product </td>
<td valign="top"> Believes desired product is mismatched with prior team products  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Workflow  </td>
<td valign="top">Causes little or no change to workflow </td>
<td valign="top">Changes some aspect of workflow or has small
effect on workflow</td>
<td valign="top">Significantly changes workflow or method of organization   </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>For any risk the team discovers as a result of working through the
risk factors chart, it should develop a risk statement and enter the
risk on a master list. A risk must be clearly expressed before it can
be managed. In stating a risk, the team should consider not only
symptoms, but also causes and results. As Figure 5.3 shows, each risk
statement should include the problem (the condition), what is causing
the problem (the source), and the expected result for both the problem
and the project (the consequence).</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f05ar03x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/f05ar03.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=85 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>
<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 5.3 </b> <i>Sample risk statement </i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>The process followed during this step is a powerful way to expose
the assumptions and differing viewpoints of various team members and
stakeholders. It's unlikely that everyone will agree on the ranking
of all risk factors. Depending on their level of experience and area of
concern, different team members will see the project differently. If no
agreement can be reached, the best approach is a majority vote
technique. If the votes are tied, caution dictates that the worst case
be used for the risk assessment.</p>

<A NAME="267"><H2>Step #2: Risk Analysis</H2></A>

<p>Risk analysis is the process whereby risk data is converted into
risk decision-making information. Thorough analysis ensures that the
team is working on the right risks.</p>

<p>Risk is primarily composed of two factors:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Risk probability</b> Risk probability is the likelihood that an
event will actually occur. A simple percentage from 0 to 100 can be
used for ranking risks. Only risks with a probability that is greater
than 0 percent pose a threat to the project. Only risks with a
probability of 100 percent are certainties&#8212;in other words, they
are known problems. The team might find it more efficient to
consistently use a 1 to 3 scale that corresponds to 25 percent, 50
percent, and 75 percent, because too many arguments are often waged
over the difference between a 60 percent and 70 percent
probability.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk impact</b> Risk impact measures the severity of adverse
affects, or the magnitude of a loss, if the risk materializes. Deciding
how to measure sustained loses is not a trivial matter. If the risk has
a financial impact, the team can use a dollar value to quantify the
magnitude of loss. The financial impact can be long-term costs in
operations and support, loss of market share, short-term costs in
additional work, or lost opportunity cost. When the financial impact is
understood, the risk impact can be classified on a simple 1 to 5 scale,
5 being the greatest impact. Additionally, other risks might have the
type of impact where only a subjective rating from 1 to 5 is
appropriate. This scale essentially rates the viability of project
success. High values indicate serious loss to the project, and medium
values show loss to portions of the project or loss of
effectiveness.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>To evaluate a list of risks, the team must understand the overall
threat each risk poses to the project. Sometimes risks that are high in
probability are low in impact and can be safely ignored. At other
times, risks that are high in impact are low in probability and can
again be safely ignored. Risks that have high exposure (high
probability and high impact) are the ones worth managing. Reducing the
risk exposure can be accomplished by reducing either the risk
probability or the risk impact.</p>

<p>To help communicate project risks, team members and stakeholders
typically maintain the following items of information in a spreadsheet
or database:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Risk identifier</b> This name uniquely identifies a risk
statement for reporting and tracking purposes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk source</b> The source can be identified from a focus area
(custom software development, infrastructure deployment, packaged
software deployment, and so on), or a category (mission and goals,
decision drivers, organizational management, and so on), and or factors
(project fit, political influences, organization stability, and so
on).</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk condition</b> This natural language statement describes
the existing condition that might lead to a loss for the project.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk consequence</b> This natural language statement describes
and quantifies the loss that can occur if the risk materializes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk probability</b> This expression represents the likelihood
that a risk that results in a loss will materialize. The probability is
typically stated as a value of 1, 2, or 3, representing a percentage of
25 percent, 50 percent, or 75 percent respectively.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk impact</b> The effect on the project, should the risk
materialize, is measured as a dollar value or a number, on a scale of 1
to 5, that indicates relative magnitude.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk exposure</b> The overall threat of the risk to the project
is calculated by balancing the likelihood of actual loss with the
magnitude of the potential loss. The result of multiplying risk impact
by risk probability is used to rank risks. (Note that to rank risk
exposure, all the risk impact values must be in the same unit of
measurement: either dollars or relative magnitude.)</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk context</b> This paragraph contains additional background
information that helps clarify the risk situation.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Related risk</b> This list of risk identifications is used to
track interdependent risks.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Risk analysis weighs the threat of each risk and determines which
risks require preventive action. After the risks are ranked by risk
exposure, the team should focus on a risk management strategy and how
to incorporate risk action plans into the overall project vision.
Because managing risk requires time and effort, the key is to identify
a limited number of major risks that must be managed. A simple but
effective technique is to develop a list of the ten highest risks for
the project. This top-ten risk list should be visible to all project
team leads. An additional list of major project risks, to raise
awareness with the project stakeholders, should be included in the
Vision Document created during the Envisioning Phase and the Master
Project Plan created during the Planning Phase.</p>

<A NAME="268"><H2>Step #3: Risk Action Planning</H2></A>

<p>Risk action planning turns risk information into decisions and
actions. Planning involves developing actions to address individual
risks, prioritizing risk actions, and creating an integrated risk
management plan that forms the basis of the <i>Master Risk Assessment
Document</i> delivered as part of the Vision Approved Milestone.</p>

<p>During risk action planning, the team should consider four facets of
each identified risk:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Research</b> Does the team know enough about this risk? Is
further study necessary to acquire more information and better
determine the characteristics of the risk before decisions are made
about what action to take?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Accept</b> Can the team live with the consequences if the risk
actually occurs? Can the risk be accepted and no further action
taken?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Manage</b> Can the team do anything to mitigate the impact of
the risk should the risk occur?</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Avoid</b> Can the risk be avoided by changing the product's
scope?</li></p>
</ul>



<p>When the team identifies a risk that needs management, team members
have three options:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Reduce the probability of occurrence.</li></p>

<p><li> Reduce the magnitude of loss.</li></p>

<p><li> Change the consequences of the risk.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>For those risks within the team's control, the action plan
consists of applying the resources needed to reduce the risk. For those
risks outside the team's control, the action plan consists of
finding workarounds. It may also be possible for the team to transfer
the risk by:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Moving to different hardware.</li></p>

<p><li> Moving a software feature to another part of the system that is
better able to handle it.</li></p>

<p><li> Subcontracting the work to a more experienced player.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>As a safety net, the team should also develop a <i>contingency
strategy</i>, which is a fallback plan that can be activated in case
the action plan fails to contain the risk. For example, suppose a
particular commercial product is needed so that software can be
deployed on desktop systems, but the release date of the commercial
product is uncertain. The team's contingency strategy might be to
use an alternate product. In this case, during Planning Phase's
design, the team would identify an alternative product to be used if
the original commercial product does not meet the release date.</p>

<p>Deciding when to resort to the contingency strategy is a matter of
watching the strategy's <i>trigger value</i>. Often the team can
establish a trigger value for each contingency plan based on the
identified type of risks or the type of project consequences. Table 5.3
shows some typical risks and consequences and their trigger values.
When a trigger value is exceeded, the corresponding contingency
strategy can be put into action to help mitigate the risk.</p>

<p><b>Table 5.3</b> <i>Sample risks and contingency plan trigger values</i></p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Type of risk  </th>
<th> Trigger value </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Schedule slips</b>  </td>
<td valign="top">Latest date to use contingency strategy<br> Latest date to select another vendor  </td></tr>
<tr>

<td valign="top">Dollar limit  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Learning time</b>  </td>
<td valign="top">Time limit  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p>To begin creating the Master Risk Assessment Document, several key
items must be identified for each risk. These items are typically
entered into an automated risk action form to assist communication
between the team members and stakeholders:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Risk identifier</b> This name uniquely identifies a risk
statement for reporting and tracking purposes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk statement</b> This natural language statement (explained
earlier) describes the condition that could possibly lead to a loss for
the project, and describes the loss that will occur if the risk
materializes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk management strategy</b> In a paragraph or two, the team
describes its strategy for managing the risk, including any assumptions
it has made.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk management strategy metrics</b> The team will use the
following metrics to determine whether the planned risk management
actions are working:</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Probability</b> The likelihood that the risk will occur.
Represented as a number between 1 and 3.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Impact</b> The severity of the impact on the project. Can be
represented as a relative number between 1 and 5. Consistent impact
measures should be used for all risks.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Exposure</b> The overall threat to the project. Calculated by
multiplying the probability by the impact.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Action items</b> This list describes the actions the team will
take to manage the risk. Any actions taken will be logged in the risk
tracking system.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Due dates</b> This is the date by which the team will complete
each planned action item.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Personnel assignments</b> These people are assigned to perform
the listed actions.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Contingency strategy</b> In a paragraph or two, the team
describes the contingency strategy to be followed in the event that the
action plan fails to manage the risk.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Contingency strategy trigger values and metrics</b> The team
will use these trigger values to determine when the contingency
strategy should be put into effect and these metrics to gauge whether
the contingency strategy is working.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="269"><H2>Step #4: Risk Tracking</H2></A>

<p>Risk tracking is essential to effectively implement an action plan.
It is the process by which the project team monitors the status of
risks and the actions it has taken to mitigate them. It includes
devising the risk metrics and trigger values needed to ensure that the
planned risk actions are working. Tracking is the watchdog function of
the risk action plan.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> It is a good practice to include a risk review
during regular project reviews and debriefings. Risk review should
include an assessment of progress made toward mitigation of the
project's top ten risks.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>During each project review, the team should report on the major
risks for the project and the status of any risk management actions.
Ranking risks over time is useful, as well as keeping a record of the
number of times a risk appears in the top-ten risk list.</p>

<p>Risk status reporting can identify four possible risk management
situations:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The risk is resolved, and the risk action plan is complete.</li></p>

<p><li> Actions are proceeding as planned, in which case the risk action
plans can continue.</li></p>

<p><li> Actions are not proceeding as planned, in which case corrective
measures should be determined or the contingency plan can be
implemented.</li></p>

<p><li> The situation has changed significantly with respect to one or
more risks, and reassessment is necessary.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>As the team takes actions to manage risks, the total risk exposure
for the project should decrease.</p>

<A NAME="270"><H2>Step #5: Risk Control</H2></A>

<p>After the team has defined the risk trigger values and metrics, the
difficult part of risk management is over. Risk management melds into
project management processes that:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Control risk action plans.</li></p>

<p><li> Correct for variations from plans.</li></p>

<p><li> Respond to trigger values.</li></p>

<p><li> Improve the risk management process.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>As suggested by Ron Higuera and Yacov Haimes in the Software
Engineering Institute paper <i>Software Risk Management</i>,</p>

<blockquote><i>If the risk management process is not integrated with
day-to-day project management, it will soon be relegated to a
background activity.</i></blockquote>

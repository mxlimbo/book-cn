<A NAME="7"><H1>Course Overview</H1></A>

<P>This self-paced course combines text, graphics, hands-on procedures, multimedia presentations, and review questions to teach you about Visual Basic. The course is designed for you to work through the book from beginning to end, but you can choose a customized track and complete only the sections that interest you. If you choose to customize your study, see the &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section in each chapter for important information regarding prerequisites.</P>

<P>The self-paced training book is divided into the following chapters:</P>

<ul>
<P><LI> &quot;<A HREF="abouta.htm#1">About This Book</A>&quot; contains a self-paced training overview and introduces the components of this book.

<P><LI> Chapter 1, &quot;<A HREF="ch01a.htm#33">Application Design Concepts</A>,&quot; discusses the Microsoft Solution Framework and how it relates to developing a multitier application. The software used in the course will also be discussed at a high level to give the reader an understanding of what each product is used for. In addition, tools for development teams will be introduced to explain the benefits of implementing source control and component management. After working through the chapter, you will be able to describe these elements and their relationship to the Microsoft Solution Framework.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 2, &quot;<A HREF="ch02a.htm#76">Creating the User Interface</A>,&quot; reviews the Visual Basic basics discussed in Desktop Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit. After completing the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to explain the role of each of these elements and incorporate them in your application.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 3, &quot;<A HREF="ch03a.htm#118">Creating COM DLLs with Visual Basic</A>,&quot; discusses class modules for the purpose of creating COM DLLs. ActiveX DLL project property settings will be explained as well as setting properties for each class contained within a COM DLL. At the end of this chapter, you will be able to create COM components through ActiveX DLL and ActiveX EXE projects in Microsoft Visual Basic.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 4, &quot;<A HREF="ch04a.htm#163">Advanced COM Programming with Visual Basic 6.0</A>,&quot; discusses how Visual Basic implements default interfaces for COM components automatically. It also explains how to create custom interfaces and the benefits of implementing custom interfaces. In addition, creating custom object models will be introduced. After completing the lesson in this chapter, you will be able to implement custom business objects and use the OLE View tool to read the IDL code created automatically by Visual Basic.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 5, &quot;<A HREF="ch05a.htm#194">Introducing ActiveX Data Objects</A>,&quot; introduces ActiveX Data Objects as the best data access method available. The benefits of using ADO for data access and the relationship between OLE DB and ADO are discussed. The object model for ADO is explained, as is the use of the Visual Basic Data Environment to connect to a database. After you have completed the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to use the Data Environment to create connections and commands.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 6, &quot;<A HREF="ch06a.htm#223">Accessing Data with ActiveX Data Objects</A>,&quot; discusses the importance of managing connections to conserve server resources. In addition, considerations for using records from a data source are introduced. The reader also learns how to navigate and manipulate data from a data source. After completing the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to connect to a data source using code, return records from a data source, and return and manage multiple recordsets.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 7, &quot;<A HREF="ch07a.htm#263">Advanced Database Topics</A>,&quot; introduces more advanced topics for implementing ADO in an enterprise environment. Topics include: managing transactions, embedded transactions, using disconnected recordsets for offline use, and performing asynchronous operations to benefit users. After you have completed the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to add methods, events and enumerations to a COM DLL to provide functionality to a client application.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 8, &quot;<A HREF="ch08a.htm#306">Using Stored Procedures</A>,&quot; explains what stored procedures are, and the benefits of implementing them. It also explains how to create stored procedures and run them from Visual Basic. After you have completed the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to use the ADO Command object to run stored procedures and create stored procedures with SQL Server.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 9, &quot;<A HREF="ch09a.htm#329">Using Microsoft Transaction Server</A>,&quot; describes the role of transactions in MTS, and how MTS manages objects and transactions. It includes steps to build MTS components that take advantage of transactions and all of the other services that MTS provides. After completing the lessons in this chapter, you will be able to use the MTS add-in for Visual Basic and use transactions in MTS components.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 10, &quot;<A HREF="ch10a.htm#373">Implementing Security in the Enterprise</A>,&quot; emphasizes that security is an important part of application architecture. It also focuses on the privacy of sensitive user information, and protection of the architectural components and processes that run applications from unauthorized tampering or eavesdropping. These issues are addressed for Windows networks, SQL Server, and Microsoft Transaction Server. After completing the lessons in this module, you will be able to create new users and groups in Windows NT Server.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Chapter 11, &quot;<A HREF="ch11a.htm#413">Debugging and Error Handling</A>,&quot; emphasizes the importance of error handling when working with COM components. The reader learns how to include code to handle errors that their components may generate on both the client and server.

<A NAME="10"><H3>Notational Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<P><LI> <I> Italic </I>in syntax statements indicates placeholders for variable information. <I>Italic</I> is also used for book titles.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Names of files and folders appear in Title Caps. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all lowercase letters when you type a file name in a dialog box or at a command prompt.</LI></P>

<P><LI> File name extensions appear in all lowercase.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Square brackets [ ] are used in syntax statements to enclose optional items. For example, [<I>filename</I>] in command syntax indicates that you can choose to type a file name with the command. Type only the information within the brackets, not the brackets themselves.</LI></P>

<P><LI> Braces { } are used in syntax statements to enclose required items. Type only the information within the braces, not the braces themselves.</LI></P>
</ul>

<A NAME="11"><H3>Keyboard Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<P><LI> A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must press those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press ALT+TAB&quot; means that you hold down ALT while you press TAB.</LI></P>

<P><LI> A comma (,) between two or more key names means that you must press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example, &quot;Press ALT, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key in sequence. &quot;Press ALT+W, L&quot; means that you first press ALT and W together, and then release them and press L.</LI></P>

<P><LI> You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the ALT key to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and the command name. For some commands, you can also press a key combination listed in the menu.</LI></P>

<P><LI> You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in dialog boxes with the keyboard. Press the ALT key, and then press the key that corresponds to the underlined letter of the option name. Or you can press TAB until the option is highlighted, and then press the spacebar to select or clear the check box or option button.</LI></P>

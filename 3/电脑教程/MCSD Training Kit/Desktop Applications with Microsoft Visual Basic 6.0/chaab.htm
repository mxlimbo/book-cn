<A NAME="666"><H2>Lab Questions</H2></A>
<OL>
<P><LI><A NAME="CH0101">What are the benefits of implementing MSF?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="667"><H3>MSF helps organizations merge business and technology objectives, reduce the life cycle costs of using new technology, and successfully deploy Microsoft technologies to streamline business processes. MSF exposes critical risks, important planning assumptions, and key interdependencies that are required to successfully plan, build, and manage a technology infrastructure or a business solution.</H3></A>

<A NAME="668"><H3>MFS helps to speed up development cycles, lower the cost of owning technology, improve execution of planned events, improve reaction to unplanned events, create scalable, reliable technology solutions, and improve core information technology competencies.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0102">What are the models implemented in MSF? What are their purposes?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="669"><H3>Team Model&#8212;defines a team of peers working in interdependent and cooperating roles.</H3></A>

<A NAME="670"><H3>Process Model&#8212;helps your team establish guidelines for planning and controlling results-oriented projects based on project scope, the resources available, and the schedule.</H3></A>

<A NAME="671"><H3>Application Model&#8212;helps your team design distributed applications that take optimum advantage of component reuse.</H3></A>

<A NAME="672"><H3>Enterprise Architecture Model&#8212;supports decisions relating to the information, applications, and technology needed to support a business. It is the key to successful long-term use of new technologies.</H3></A>

<A NAME="673"><H3>Solutions Design Model&#8212;shows how applications must be designed from a user and business perspective (as opposed to the ideal streamlined development proposed in the Application Model).</H3></A>

<A NAME="674"><H3>Infrastructure Model&#8212;establishes MSF principles for managing the people, processes, and technology that support networks in a large enterprise.</H3></A>

<A NAME="675"><H3>Total Cost of Ownership Model&#8212;supports the process of assessing, improving, and managing information technology costs and maximizing value.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0103">What are the three design phases of the solution design model? What tasks are accomplished in these phases?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="676"><H3>Conceptual involves business sponsors, users, managers, and constituencies. The goal of conceptual design is to understand what the users do and to identify business needs. Much of conceptual design is an analysis activity that leads to determining which processes and activities will go into the new system, how the needs of those processes and activities will be met, and what the user's experience will be of those activities.</H3></A>

<A NAME="677"><H3>Logical design activities are integrated directly with the resulting scenarios from conceptual design, and provide the basis for Physical design. Logical design describes the organization of the elements that make up the solution and how they interact. You assemble the elements for optimum efficiency, performance, and reuse.</H3></A>

<A NAME="678"><H3>Physical design describes a solution in a way that allows developers to construct the solution. Physical design communicates the necessary details of the solution, including organization, structure, technology, and relationships between elements that you will use to create the solution.</H3></A>

<A NAME="679"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>
<OL>
<P><LI><A NAME="CHO101R">What is the Microsoft Solutions Framework?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="680"><H3>Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) is a suite of models, principles, and guides for building and deploying software. MSF is a collection of best practices used by the Microsoft product groups and Microsoft Consulting Services.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0102R">Which MSF Model directly focuses on software development?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="681"><H3>The Solution Design Model provides a step-by-step strategy for designing business-oriented solutions driven by a specific business need. This model ties together the Application, Team, and Process Models, and makes it possible for the information system staff to focus resources where they can produce the most value. Because software development is a creative and complex process, you can apply MSF's Solution Design Model to software development.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0103R">What is an example of a single-tier application?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="682"><H3>An example of a single-tier application is Microsoft Excel, where the user interface and business rules are combined in the application. The business rules include calculating totals, spell check, and other mathematical functions. In addition, the routines that access and save the Excel application files (.xls) are part of the same application layer as the user interface and business rules.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0104R">When is a two-tier application most effective?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="683"><H3>Two-tier applications work well in departmental-scale applications with modest numbers of users (under 100); a single database; and secure, fast networking.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0105R">What are three ways to install Visual SourceSafe?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="684"><H3>Both the Visual SourceSafe Explorer and the Visual SourceSafe Database can be installed on the user's machine.</H3></A>

<A NAME="685"><H3>The Visual SourceSafe Explorer and the Visual SourceSafe Database can both be installed on the server.</H3></A>

<A NAME="686"><H3>The Visual SourceSafe Explorer will be installed on the user's machine and the Visual SourceSafe Database will be installed on a server.</H3></A>

<P><LI><A NAME="CH0106R">What are some of the commands used in Visual SourceSafe to reuse files and how are they used?</A></LI></P>

<A NAME="687"><H3>Sharing: To share a file, you create a shared link between two projects.</H3></A>

<A NAME="688"><H3>Branching: Branching a file breaks the shared link, while retaining a copy of the file.</H3></A>

<A NAME="689"><H3>Merging: The process of combining differences in two or more changed copies of a file into a new version of the file. </H3></A>

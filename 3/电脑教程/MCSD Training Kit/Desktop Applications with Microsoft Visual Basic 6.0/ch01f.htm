<A NAME="74"><H1>Lab: Using the Microsoft Solutions Framework</H1></A>

<P>This lab reiterates the role of the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) in planning your Visual Basic application. It also includes a brief overview of the application you will develop throughout the labs in this course.</P>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b>

<A NAME="75"><H2>Microsoft Solutions Framework</H2></A>

<P>The Microsoft Solutions Framework is a development framework produced by Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS). It is based on Microsoft's internal development methodology, and is a collection of best practices used by the Microsoft product groups and Microsoft Consulting Services. You can use MSF concepts as you plan a multi-developer project.</P>

<ol>
<p><li>What are the benefits of implementing MSF?</li></p>
<P><a href="chaaa.htm#CH0101">Answer</a></P> 

<p><li>What are the models implemented in MSF? What are their purposes?</li></p>
<P><a href="chaaa.htm#CH0102">Answer</a></P> 

<p><li>What are the three design phases of the solution design model? What tasks are accomplished in these phases?</li></p>
<P><a href="chaaa.htm#CH0103">Answer</a></P>

<A NAME="76"><H2>The Chateau St. Mark Hotel Reservation System</H2></A>

<P>Throughout this course, you will create a cumulative lab based on a fictitious hotel reservation system. By the end of all the labs, you will have created:</P>

<ul>
<p><li>A complete user interface for the hotel reservation system.</li></p>

<p><li>Validation functions and subroutines to ensure accurate data.</li></p>

<p><li>Class modules from which objects can be created based on guests and reservations.</li></p>
</ul>

<P>You will also have performed these functions in creating this application:</P>

<ul>
<p><li>Store and retrieve data for the reservation system from a database used ADO technology.</li></p>

<p><li>Implement ActiveX components to construct a sound solution.</li></p>

<p><li>Provide help to users of the hotel reservation system.</li></p>

<p><li>Compile and deploy your solution using Visual Basic tools.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="77"><H3>Using the Supplemental Course Material Lab Files</H3></A>

<P>The CD-ROM that accompanies this course has several files for your use. By default, these files are copied to your local hard drive in the \Labs folder. Each lab is in a separate subfolder, for example Lab 1 is in \Labs\Lab01. In each of these folders are two additional subfolders, \Partial and \Solution.</P>

<P>The Partial folder contains the applications as it looks at the beginning of the lab.</P>

<P>The Solution folder contains a completed version of the lab solution. This project has had each step applied and can be used to review the completed lab.</P>

<ul>
<p><li>The recommended procedure is to build the hotel reservation in the order presented by each lab. Follow the labs in numerical order. Save your work and use it in the next lab to continue building the reservation system. </li></p>

<p><li>If you do not create the reservation application, you can start with the project in the \Labs\Lab<I>n</I>\Partial folder. It lets you begin each lab from the appropriate starting point.</li></p>

<p><li>You should check your work against the \Labs\Lab<I>n</I>\Solution project after you complete each lab. </li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="78"><H3>Viewing the Chateau St. Mark Hotel Solution</H3></A>

<P>If you would like a preview of the overall lab solution that you will create, open the Visual Basic project file (.vbp) located in the \Labs\Lab01\Solution directory.</P>

<P><LI><B>To view lab solution code</B></LI></P>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Hotelres.vbp file located in the \Labs\Lab01\Solution directory.</li></p>

<P>In this lab, there are no coding steps to follow. So, you will use the project in the Solution folder for review.</P>

<p><li>Double-click the <B>frmReservations</B> form object in the <B>Project Explorer</B>.</li></p>

<P>This opens the form designer for the main user interface of the Chateau St. Mark hotel lab solution.</P>

<p><li>Double-click the form to open the Visual Basic code window.</li></p>

<P>In the Visual Basic code window, you can view the various event procedures that perform tasks in the user interface. You can view code for any other object in the Project Explorer by double-clicking it and opening the Visual Basic code Window.</P>

<p><li>Double-click the class modules in the Visual Basic Project Explorer to view the code that performs check-in, check-out, and cancellation services for guests of the hotel.</li></p>

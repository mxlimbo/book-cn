<A NAME="691"><H2>Review Questions</H2></A>
<OL>
<p><LI><A NAME="CH0201">Your boss told you to follow the "look" of Microsoft Word in designing the user interface of your new insurance form.</A></LI></p>  
  
<p>What specific elements will you look at?</p>  
  
<p>Why did he want you to do this?</p>

<A NAME="692"><H3>Look at the layout and colors. This includes: where various buttons, such as OK, are located; icons on toolbars; menu commands and their access keys; the order of the menus in Word (File is first, Edit is next, and so on.)</H3></A>

<A NAME="693"><H3>The people in our company use Microsoft Word regularly, and they will more easily learn a new application that has an interface that looks familiar. Reducing their learning curve saves training time and expense.</H3></A>

<p><LI><A NAME="CH0202">When would you have to set a startup form?</A></LI></p>

<A NAME="694"><H3>When the application has more than one form, you have to designate which will be the first one the user sees. By default, Visual Basic will use the first form in a project as the defaulkt startup form. As your applications become more complex, you will need to add additional forms. You may find that a form added later in the project should be used as the intial form.</H3></A>

<p><LI><A NAME="CH0203">What causes form events to fire?</A></LI></p>

<A NAME="695"><H3>A user action such as a mouse click or a key press fires a form event. The system can also cause form events to fire, such as Windows shutting down.</H3></A>

<p><LI><A NAME="CH0204">What is the difference between standard controls and custom controls, and where do you get them?</A></LI></p>

<A NAME="696"><H3>Standard controls are included in Visual Basic and are automatically available in the toolbox. Custom controls are additional controls that can be added to the toolbox if you want to use them in a project. Some come with Visual Basic. Additional controls come in the Professional and Enterprise editions of Visual Basic. Custom controls are also available from third-party developers.</H3></A>

<p><LI><A NAME="CH0205">Why would you set control properties at design time?</A></LI></p>  
  
<P>Why would you set them at run time?</P>

<A NAME="697"><H3>You set properties at design time when you want to set defaults for the application. You set properties at run time when you want to control actions as the application runs.</H3></A>


<P><LI><A NAME="CH0206">What is a control array?</A></LI></P> 
  
<P>When do you need a control array?</P>

<A NAME="698"><H3>A control array is a group of controls that share the same name, type, and event procedures. But each control has its own properties.</H3></A>

<A NAME="699"><H3>You use control arrays to save system resources and to add controls at run time.</H3></A>

            <p>STUDY MATERIALS: TRANSCENDER, EXAM CRAM, MOC NT 4.0, SYBEX </p>
            <p>I found reading alot of different material rounded my knowledge 
              the DNS and WINS. Subnetting was easy simple questions if you know 
              the tables: </p>
            <p>mask # of subnets Bit interval # of hosts </p>
            <p>192 2 64 62 </p>
            <p>224 6 32 30 </p>
            <p>240 14 16 14 </p>
            <p>248 30 8 6 </p>
            <p>252 62 4 2 </p>
            <p>254 126 2 - </p>
            <p>255 254 1 - </p>
            <p><br>
              128 + 64 + 32 + 16 +8 + 4 + 2 + 1 </p>
            <p>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ </p>
            <p>192 224 240 248 252 254 255 </p>
            <p>I passed this monster with 827, really alot of DNS, WINS and DHCP. 
            </p>
            <p>Know the utilities: </p>
            <p>ping <br>
              ipconfig/all/renew/release <br>
              nbtstat -n,-R,-c <br>
              netstat <br>
              route print <br>
              tracert <br>
              arp -s,-a,-g,-d <br>
              lpq <br>
              lpr <br>
              Performance Monitor and Network Monitor, know the difference between 
              which will capture frames (Ethernet) and which will chart or log 
              data to be viewed thru spreadsheet. </p>
            <p>You need to know Netbios Name Resolution and Host name resolution 
            </p>
            <p>How to integrate WINS and DNS. </p>
            <p>How to enable DNS for WINS resolution. </p>
            <p>DHCP can only integrate with WINS if you specify the 44/NBNS server, 
              and /46NBT node type </p>
            <p>Know the #PRE #DOM #INCLUDE from lmhosts-file </p>
            <p>Exclude UNIX clients from any DHCP scopes </p>
            <p>The cache.dns file contain's name to-IP-addressing information 
              for the Internet's root DNS servers. </p>
            <p>For routing you need to enable IP forwarding. </p>
            <p>RIP for IP effeciently solves problem of having to update routing 
              tables. </p>
            <p>For DHCP to assign IP addresses to a remote subnet, a DHCP Relay 
              Agent needs to be set up on router in between subnets to broadcast 
              requests, or DHCP servers must be on both subnets. </p>
            <p>Know the problems when you have an LMHOSTS file and you can remove 
              the # signs out, example: </p>
            <p>147.68.56.54 #APPServer </p>
            <p>147.68.22.34 #Dserver </p>
            <p>147.68.57.87 #3server </p>
            <p>Be familiar with the SNMP manager and agent. Know what a community 
              name and a trap are. </p>
            <p>Know that you need to install TCP/IP printing services to have 
              an NT 4.0 print server print to a UNIX printing device. </p>
            <p>Know the difference between Global, Scope, and Client Options in 
              DHCP </p>
            <p>KNOW the CNAME and MX resource records </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              Well I had a few scenario questions which involved the DHCP configuration. 
            </p>
            <p>Network with 100 workstations and 20 UNIX computers. UNIX computers 
              never move, TCP/IP is protocol used. DHCP configured with one scope 
              for each subnet. All Windows based computers are set up as DHCP 
              clients. </p>
            <p>Required results: </p>
            <p>1) Every Windows based computer on each subnet must be able to 
              access the Windows NT Server computers by computer name. </p>
            <p>2) Every Windows based computer on each subnet must also be able 
              to receive its IP address from the DHCP server. </p>
            <p>Optional: </p>
            <p>1)All UNIX systems should access by hostname any Windows NT Server 
              computer that is set up as an FTP server. </p>
            <p>2) All Windows based computers should access by hostname any UNIX 
              computer that is set up as an TELNET or FTP server. </p>
            <p>Proposed Solution: </p>
            <p>1) Set up network routers and forward DHCP broadcasts to all subnets 
            </p>
            <p>2) Install Wins server on the network </p>
            <p>3) Install DNS server and configure it for name resolution </p>
            <p>4) Set up DHCP server to supply all DHCP clients with the IP address 
              of both the WINS sever and the DNS server. </p>
            <p>5) On the DHCP server, exclude the UNIX computers' IP addresses 
              from the scope. </p>
            <p>6) On the WINS server, make static mapping entries for UNIX computers. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Produces required and both optional results in this scenario. However, 
              there was one right before it that was close but only produced one 
              of the optional results because they did not install DNS and configure 
              it for name resolution so the.... Optional Result#1) All UNIX systems 
              should access by hostname any Windows NT Server computer that is 
              set up as an FTP server was not achieved. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              Overall the test was pretty tough, you had to know alot of information. 
            </p>
            <p>Studying payed off!! One more test left, SQL 6.5 admin, and I'll 
              be an MCSE, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight BABY...oooohhhh.....ooooooohhh!!! 
            </p>
            <p>GOOD LUCK! </p>

            <p>Subject: 70-64 Exam </p>
            <p>What a relief! I was so afraid that I wouldn't have a chance to 
              write this today. Well, it is my turn to contribute somethin' to 
              this dumpsite. </p>
            <p>I guess I didn't do too bad, considering that I am a new comer 
              to this field and have no networking experience at all. I am just 
              another proof that hands-on experience in networking is a plus but 
              not a necessity for passing the exam. My score is 918/1000. </p>
            <p>What I used were the Exam Cram for Win95 and the book from Sybex. 
              Originally I felt the Sybex book was a little boring but after I 
              spent sometime reading the Exam Cram I rediscovered the usefulness 
              of the Sybex book. Basically I only used the Sybex book as a reference 
              but this book definitely provides all the materials needed for the 
              exam. If you doubt, well, I am the proof. I also downloaded the 
              prep tests from Microsoft and from another vendor. Make sure you 
              download them becoz they give you an idea how the exams are like. 
              Then of course, the material in this dumpsite saved me tons of time. 
              Thank you! </p>
            <p>I have another approach to help you guys (gals). To be honest, 
              questions on other pages of this section can perhaps give you a 
              pretty good idea how the questions are written. However, you won't 
              be smart enough to think that you are going to see the same questions 
              on your test right? Remember hardworking is still the key to success. 
              So, I'll tell you what NOT to study to save you time. </p>
            <p>Do not study the following: </p>
            <p>Windows history, Architecture and memory, MS Exchange, Multimedia, 
              PnP... Do a lot of study in netwoking with NT and Netware systems, 
              system policies, user profiles, troubleshooting, installation, and 
              dialup networking, remote admin. </p>
            <p>What to watch out: </p>
            <p>1. MS will trick you by naming a Win95 workstation as server. Remember, 
              you cannot download the list of users of your domain to Win95. It 
              doesn't have administrative tools. </p>
            <p>2. To save time, if you are given a situation and a diagram, and 
              if the proposed solution is in the diagram, you don't really need 
              to read the required or optional results. The answers are in the 
              diagram. All these questions deal with user/group policies. Just 
              match your choices with the diagram. </p>
            <p>3. Know which protocols are used in which networks. Also, NetBEUI 
              is NOT ROUTABLE. </p>
            <p>4. Know how to trobleshoot printer problems. Know what EMF and 
              RAW files are. </p>
            <p>5. Know why you click &quot;capture port&quot; for printing. </p>
            <p>6. Know remote administration. </p>
            <p>7. Net watcher, administrator, and System monitor. System monitor, 
              know why an app is using increasing CPU time. (Threads are not returning 
              resources). </p>
            <p>8. Know how to apply individual policy to people who also belong 
              to a group. </p>
            <p>9. Know how to assign piorities on group policies. </p>
            <p>Know how to troubleshoot setup problems. Know that unbinding client 
              for MS network with modem </p>
            <p>TCP/IP can prevent people from the internet to access your network. 
            </p>
            <p>Really, forget about the history stuff and achitecture stuff (for 
              example, how a modem or printer work, like print process). Know 
              the practical stuff that you will face in real-life situations. 
              A guy with his computer crashed won't ask you what is a network 
              or what is the OSI model right? </p>
            <p>Also, know the differences b/t the various versions of NDIS drivers, 
              know NETX and VLM, know how to setup print and drop with Netware 
              servers (know the requirements)... </p>
            <p>Well, this is all I can churn out at this time. I wouldn't say 
              the exam was hard. Of course, if you know your stuff you will have 
              no problems. The exam is not that tricky. Watch your clock! </p>

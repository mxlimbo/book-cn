          <td>70-063　MCSE Passed Win95 exam 
            <p>I passed the Win95 exam this morning. Thanks to this list for valuable 
              information. </p>
            <p>The best resource for this exam is the Windows 95 Resource Kit 
              by Microsoft Press. Virtually everything on the exam is covered 
              in this book, which is very well written. If you find the book too 
              long, then at least read the beginning and end of each chapter. 
            </p>
            <p>The test was similar to the free exams at Microsoft's website. 
              Download pepmcse.exe, asm1.exe, asm2.exe, asm3.exe from http://www.microsoft.com/mcp 
            </p>
            <p>I think I got several questions on the actual exam that were the 
              same or similar to those in the free Microsoft exams, which I felt 
              were far superior to Transcender. </p>
            <p>If you are preparing for the exam be sure to look at Microsoft's 
              exam objectives at http://www.microsoft.com/Train_Cert/mcp/exam/prep/PG70-063.htm

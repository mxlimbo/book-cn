            <p>Well, I passed my second MS test today win95 with 871- I feel good 
              about that although of course I would have liked it to be higher. 
            </p>
            <p>I went and read the win95 resource kit (downloaded free from Microsoft) 
              and worked with the transcender exams as well as had experience 
              with win95- I still feel like I couldn't have done it without the 
              braindumps- particularly from Braindump heaven (plug for the site) 
              some of the questions were real head scratchers- made you think 
              it through.essed on and could have gotten it wrong- the first one 
              was like the third question in the test and made me wonder if I 
              was in over my head: </p>
            <p>the first question that totally threw me was a scenario where you 
              are detecting hardware with win95 and it was asking what was the 
              difference between safe detection and interactive query detection. 
              for the life of me I could not remember the answer. I guessed at 
              the answer and could have gotten it wrong according to the test 
              results. My advice: read through the glossary of the resource kit 
              to familiarize yourself with all the terms even the seemingly unimportant 
              ones. </p>
            <p>2nd question concerned connecting a win95 machine configured for 
              a tcp/ip network to a unix box. It said that you had the host name 
              configured on your printer and yet you still cannot connect. there 
              were only two choices that made any sense. </p>
            <p>The unix box is not configured for host names for net bios. </p>
            <p>your computer cannot resolve the host name to an IP address for 
              the box. </p>
            <p>I chose the second one and could have gotten it wrong- I missed 
              one question in this section. </p>
            <p>I hope this helps someone knowing what to study for. </p>
            <p>On to NT Server...</p>

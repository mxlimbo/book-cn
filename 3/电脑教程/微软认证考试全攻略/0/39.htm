            <p>　　Just finished the Win95 exam and passed with an 899 score. I'm 
              surprised at the score as I was not happy with the test questions. 
              Very Network heavy with more NT than expected and some pretty tricky 
              questions involving multiple network services being run on a single 
              machine. Not much on user profiles and system policies (which I 
              expected more). A few questions on defrag and scandisk. Only one 
              question on command line switches (another surprise but a good one) 
              that involved netsetup.exe (and I chose the answer without a switch 
              being used). Just a few on architecture and none involving memory 
              spaces (2g-3g, etc) or Rings. </p>
            <p>I think the key was to set the hard ones aside and complete them 
              later so you had time to concentrate and map things out on paper. 
            </p>
            <p>I studied using the QUE Test Prep and NewRiders book. Highly recommend 
              the QUE book as it is a great prep tool and quite comprehensive. 
              There are a few wrong answers though (I recall ones involving where 
              the system policy is stored on the network) but it was the bulk 
              of my study. New Riders is good, but I rarely went back to it once 
              I read it thru the first time. </p>
            <p>I had the MS Resource Kit as a backup but didn't use it much as 
              it was so detailed. I borrowed it from someone and am glad I didn't 
              purchase it (and most or all of it is on the Win95 CD anyway.) </p>
            <p>Sorry I don't have details of questions like many do, but my info 
              was dumped from my brain as soon as I saw the passing score. </p>
            <p>Good luck to all. </p>

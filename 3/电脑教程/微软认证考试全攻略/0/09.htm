          <td> Question 1. You have been tasked to implement a disk fault tolerance 
            strategy for your company. The disk set should make the most efficient 
            use of disk space and it should also have the fastest access time 
            of all the fault tolerance disk sets under Windows NT. What disk set 
            should you implement? 
            <p>a . Disk striping without parity.<br>
              b. Volume set<br>
              c. Disk duplexing<br>
              d. Disk striping with parity </p>
            <p>Disk mirroring ( duplexing ) only make use of 50% of disk space. 
              Therefore, you can eliminate C. Disk striping without parity and 
              volume sets do not provide any fault tolerance. Of all of Windows 
              NT's fault toelerance disks sets, Disk striping with parity prvodies 
              the most efficient use of disk space. It, along with disk striping 
              without parity, provides the fatest read operations of all of NT's 
              disk sets.</p>
            <p>Question 2. You need to implement a disk fault tolerance strategy 
              for your company. <br>
              Required result : Disk operations must be able to continue if one 
              member fails.</p>
            <p>Optional results : The boot partition must be part of the disk 
              set. Disk write operations must be optimized.</p>
            <p>Proposed soulition : Implement disk striping without parity.</p>
            <p>Which results does the proposed solution produce?</p>
            <p>a. The proposed solution produces the required result and the optional 
              results.<br>
              b. The proposed solution produces the required result and produces 
              only one of the optional results<br>
              c. The proposed solution produces the required result but it does 
              not produce any of the optional results.<br>
              d. The proposed solution does not produce the required result or 
              the optional results.</p>
            <p>Although, it is always a good practive to map the proposed solution 
              to the optional results, there are some instances when mapping the 
              proposed solution to the required result is useful. You should do 
              step 2 first only if the presented required result is simple, like 
              in this scenario. By doing step 2 first in this question, the required 
              result is not satisified. When the required result is not satisifed, 
              then the only possible answer is D. Disk striping wihtout parity 
              does not provide any fault tolerance. Therefore, if one or more 
              member fails in the set, disk operations cannot continue. The required 
              result is not satisified.</p>
            <p><br>
              Question 3. Your company is currently using disk mirroring. You 
              have been tasked to implement a new fault tolerance strategy. <br>
              Required result : Disk operations must be able to continue if two 
              members fail.</p>
            <p>Optional results : Read operations should be faster than disk mirroring. 
              The system and CPU overhead should be less than disk mirroring. 
            </p>
            <p>Proposed solution : Implement disk striping with parity.</p>
            <p>Which results does the proposed solution produce?</p>
            <p>a. The proposed solution produces the required result and the optional 
              results.<br>
              b. The proposed solution produces the required result and produces 
              only one of the optional results<br>
              c. The proposed solution produces the required result but it does 
              not produce any of the optional results.<br>
              d. The proposed solution does not produce the required result.</p>
            <p>Required result : A ) Disk operations must be able to continue 
              if two members fail.</p>
            <p>Optional results : B ) Read operations should be faster than disk 
              mirroring. C ) The system and CPU overhead should be less than disk 
              mirroring. </p>
            <p>Proposed solution : 1 ) Implement disk striping with parity.</p>
            <p>Map 1 to B : A stripe set with parity, along with a stripe set 
              without parity, provides the fastest read operation out of all NT's 
              disk sets. One optional result is satisified.</p>
            <p>Map 1 to C : In a stripe set with parity, the CPU is required to 
              calculate the parity bits before writing them to disk. Therefore, 
              the write operations of a stripe set with parity is the slowest 
              out of all NT's disk sets. Optional result C is not satisified. 
              Result of step 1 : Only one optional result is satisified. You can 
              eliminate answer A.</p>
            <p>Map 1 to A : In a stripe set with parity, if one member fails than 
              disk operations can continue. However, if two or more members fail, 
              then disk operations will stop until the failed members are replaced 
              and data is restord from tape backup. </p>
            <p>Count : The required result is not satisified. When the required 
              result is not satisified, then there can only be one possible answer.</p>
            <p><br>
              Question 4. True or False. A volume set does not provide fault tolerance, 
              but it does provide an increase in disk performance. <br>
              <br>
              a . True.<br>
              b. False.</p>
            <p>A volume set is just a collection of free disk space. A volume 
              set does not provide fault tolerance nor does it provide any increase 
              in disk performance.</p>
            <p><br>
              Question 5. You have a Windows NT server, SMALLNT, in a resource 
              domain that is running an SQL database. Users in all trusted domains 
              are accessing the database on SMALLNT, which only has one hard drive. 
              How can you implement a fault tolerance strategy on SMALLNT? <br>
              <br>
              a . By adding two more hard drives and implementing RAID level 1.<br>
              b. By adding two more hard drives and implementing a volume set.<br>
              c. By adding two more hard drives and implementing RAID level 5.<br>
              d. By adding a second hard drive and implementing RAID level 1.</p>
            <p>RAID level 1 : Stripe set without parity does not provide any fault 
              tolerance. You can eliminate A and D.</p>
            <p>RAID level 5 : Stripe set with parity provides fault tolerance. 
              You need a mnium of three members and up to a maximum of 32.</p>
            <p>Volume set : Provides no fault tolerance and no performance increase. 
              A volume set is just a collection of free hard disk space combined 
              into a logical drive.</p>
            <p><br>
              Question 6. You have ten hard disks configured as a stripe set with 
              parity on your Windows NT Server computer. On a certain day, two 
              members in the set fails. What must you do to restore the stripe 
              set with parity? <br>
              <br>
              a . Replace the failed members and regenerate the data through the 
              Regenerate command in the Fault Tolerance menu.<br>
              b. Replace the failed members and reboot the computer. Then use 
              the Windows NT Backup to restore the data.<br>
              c. Replace the failed members and recreate the stripe set with parity. 
              Restore the data from tape backup.<br>
              d. Replace the failed members and reboot the computer. Windows NT 
              will automatically regenerate the data.</p>
            <p>In a stripe set with parity, you can have 3 - 32 members in the 
              set. You must have a minimum of 3. </p>
            <p>If 1 member in a stripe set with parity fails ====&gt; Disk operations 
              will continue. To recreate the stripe set with parity, replace the 
              failed member and regenerate the parity bits through the Disk Administrator. 
            </p>
            <p>If 2 or more members in a stripe with parity fails ====&gt; Disk 
              operations will stop. To recreate the stripe set with parity, replace 
              the failed members, recreate the stripe set with parity, and restore 
              data from tape backup. </p>
            <p>Question : On member in your stripe set with parity fails. Under 
              what circumtance will Windows NT automatically recreate the parity 
              stripes?</p>
            <p>Answer : Never. You have to replace the failed memeber and manually 
              recreate the parity stripes through the Disk Administrator.</p>
            <p><br>
              Question 7. True or False. Disk operations can continue in a volume 
              set if one member in the set fails, but it cannot continue if two 
              or more members in the set fails. <br>
              <br>
              a. True.<br>
              b. False.</p>
            <p>A volume set does provide any fault tolerance. If one member fails, 
              then disk operations will stop. Only disk mirroring ( its hybrid 
              disk duplexing ) and disk striping with parity provide fault tolerance 
              under Windows NT.</p>
            <p>Question 8. You have a Windows NT Server computer called BIGNT, 
              which has three hard drives. Each hard drive has one, and only one, 
              primary partition. The boot partition is on the first drive and 
              the system partition is on the second drive. Using the existing 
              configuration, what fault tolerance standard can you implement on 
              your Windows NT server? </p>
            <p>a . Disk mirroring.<br>
              b. Disk striping with parity.<br>
              c. Either A or B can be used..<br>
              d. You cannot implement fault tolerance given the scenario. The 
              system parition must be on the first physical hard drive in order 
              to implement fault tolerance. </p>
            <p>The only possible choice is disk mirroring-- since disk mirroring 
              is the only fault tolerance standard that can include the system 
              or boot partition.</p>
            <p>Answer D : The system partition ( the partition that contains the 
              boot up files ) can be on any physical hard disk, and not necessary 
              the first physical hard drive. You just have to change the ARC pathname 
              in the &quot;boot.ini&quot; file to point to the physical disk number 
              where the system partition resides.</p>
            <p>Question 9. You have four hard drives on your Windows NT Server 
              computer. You would like to use the free disk space from all four 
              drives to create one logical drive. You would like to have the fastest 
              read operations, and you are not concerened about fault tolerance. 
              What is the best disk set to implement? <br>
              <br>
              a . A volume set.<br>
              b. A stripe set with parity.<br>
              c. A stripe set without parity.<br>
              d. A mirror set.</p>
            <p>A stripe set without parity provides the fastest read and write 
              operations out of all NT's disk sets. In a stripe set without parity, 
              information is read and written to all members simultenously. In 
              a volume set, information is read and written to only ONE member 
              at a time. If you want the best disk performance, and you are not 
              concerend with fault tolerance, then a stripe set without parity 
              is the way to go.</p>
            <p>Question 10. You've implemented disk striping without parity on 
              your Windows NT Server computer. There are five members in the set. 
              On a certain day, one member in the set fails. What must you do 
              to restore data? <br>
              <br>
              a . Use Regenerate command in the Fault Tolerance menu in Disk Administrator.<br>
              b. Use the Recreate command in the Fault Tolerance menu in Disk 
              Administrator.<br>
              c. Restore the data from tape backup.<br>
              d. Replace the failed member and use the Regenerate command in the 
              Fault Tolerance menu in Disk Administrator.</p>
            <p>Disk striping without parity provides the fastest read and write 
              operations. However, it does NOT provide any fault tolerance. If 
              one member in a stripe set without parity fails, then you must restore 
              data from tape backup.</p>
            <p>Question : True or False. You want to change the size of the stripe 
              set without parity. You must re-create the stripe set without parity 
              and restore all data from backup.</p>
            <p>Answer True. In a stripe set without or with parity, the parition 
              of all members in the set must be the same size. If you want to 
              change the size of the stripe set, then you must re-create the stripe 
              set and restore data from tape backup.</p>

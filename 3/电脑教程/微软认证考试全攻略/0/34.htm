            <p><br>
              Detection Log Files </p>
            <p>Windows 95 has several log files generated to detect and troubleshoot 
              problems: </p>
            <p>SETUPLOG.TXT- Used to log installation of Windows95. Will note 
              last utility run prior to a system halt. <br>
              DETCRASH.LOG- Used to log hardware detection during setup. Readable 
              only by setup to determine which module was running when the system 
              halted. <br>
              DETLOG.TXT- Equivalent of DETCRASH.LOG written in a readable format. 
              <br>
              NETLOG.TXT- Logs detected network component information. <br>
              IOS.LOG - Logs error messages from the SCSI drivers. <br>
              PPPLOG.TXT - Logs PPP and dial-up activity. </p>
            <p><br>
              The infamous Windows 95 Registry </p>
            <p>The Registry is designed as a database used by OLE to store information 
              on OLE servers. It is used by Windows 95 to store the information 
              typically found in Windows 3.x .INI files and the reg.dat file. 
              The Registry can be used for troubleshooting and enhancing performance 
              in Windows 95. The registry is a heirarchical tree which contains 
              information about many things in the computer. The following is 
              a list of the Registry subtrees and what they contain: </p>
            <p><br>
              Subtree Information stored within <br>
              HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT Contains information about OLE servers and file 
              associations. It contains the same information that is typically 
              stored in the reg.dat in Windows 3.x. <br>
              HKEY_CURRENT_USER Contains the preferences of the user who is currently 
              logged in. Receives stored information from the user's subtree located 
              in HKEY_USERS. <br>
              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Contains hardware information and settings for 
              any device ever installed in the computer. <br>
              HKEY_USERS Contains preferences for every user that has ever logged 
              into the computer. <br>
              HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG <br>
              Contains settings for all hardware devices currently installed in 
              the computer. Does not contain settings for devices included in 
              HKEY_DYN_DATA. <br>
              HKEY_DYN_DATA Contains dynamically stored data on performance monitoring. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              You can use the program Regedit.exe to modify the Registry. </p>
            <p>The Registry contains three properties: Name, Data Type, and Value. 
              The Data Type can be a binary value (a collection of bits), a string 
              value (a string of readable characters) and a DWORD value (a binary 
              value limited to 4 bytes). </p>
            <p><br>
              Intel Memory Protection Architecture </p>
            <p>The 386 architecture has four privelege levels designed to protect 
              data from being damaged. Level 0 is the highest, and level 3 is 
              the lowest. Windows 95 only uses levels 0 and 3. It uses level 0 
              for 95 core components and level 3 for user applications and non-critical 
              components. </p>
            <p><br>
              Virtual Machines </p>
            <p>A virtual machine is an illusional environment created by the operating 
              system in memory. Virtual machines run in ring 3 of the Intel architecture. 
              These are designed to allocate resources to programs that might 
              normally be halted by other programs in memory. Each MS-DOS application 
              runs in its own virtual machine, as they are designed to have total 
              and uninterupted access to all system resources. All other non-MS-DOS 
              based programs run in the System virtual machine. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Windows 95 Core Components </p>
            <p>Windows 95 has three core components: Kernel, User and GDI. All 
              three are .DLL files which reside in the system as both 16-bit and 
              32-bit applications to maintain backwards compatibility. </p>
            <p>Kernel - Responsible for basic O/S functionality, managing virtual 
              memory, task scheduling, and File I/O services. User - Manages the 
              user interface, including input from devices and interaction with 
              drivers. </p>
            <p>GDI - Responsible for all graphics manipulation. </p>
            <p><br>
              Plug and Play </p>
            <p>Plug and Play - designed for hardware installation to require no 
              intervention from the user. A plug and play system needs to consist 
              of the following to be complete: </p>
            <p>A plug and play operating system <br>
              A plug and play BIOS <br>
              Plug and play hardware <br>
              Legacy Cards - Hardware designed prior to Plug and Play which, when 
              installed, will not automatically be setup by the OS and must be 
              setup manually. </p>
            <p>Bus Enumerator - Type of driver based on a specific bus architecture. 
              Used to build the hardware tree in the registry. </p>
            <p><br>
              Plug and Play Docking </p>
            <p>Docking - The process which a computer uses to establish connection 
              with a docking station. There are three types of docking: </p>
            <p>Hot - Computer can be at full power when it is docked or undocked 
              <br>
              Warm - Computer can be in sleep mode when it is docked or undocked 
              <br>
              Cold - Computer can must be turned off before being docked or undocked 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Disk operations </p>
            <p>IFS (Installable File System) - architecture which allows multiple 
              file systems to coexist on the same computer. </p>
            <p>VFAT - 32-bit virtualized File Allocation Table used in Win95. 
            </p>
            <p>VCache - 32-bit protected mode cache driver which replaces the 
              real-mode SmartDrive. </p>
            <p>Long File Names - Win95 supports extended file names which can 
              contain up to 255 characters, unlike DOS which was limited to the 
              8.3 structure. In Win95, each long file name has a duplicate 8.3 
              for backwards compatibility. </p>
            <p><br>
              Memory </p>
            <p>Conventional Memory - First 640k of RAM, used for DOS applications 
              and TSR's. <br>
              Upper Memory - 384k RAM located between 640k and 1mb. Used to load 
              MS-DOS device drivers to help increase space available for DOS applications. 
              <br>
              High Memory Area - Region between 1mb and 1088k. <br>
              Extended Memory - Region extending from 1088k to the end of the 
              memory. Was created for DOS applications to be able to access RAM 
              outside of the first 640k. <br>
              Expanded Memory - Uses bank-switching to page data in and out of 
              memory quickly. </p>
            <p><br>
              Virtual Address Spaces </p>
            <p>Each process is alloacted a virtual address space for the process's 
              threads to use. This virtual space appears to be 4g in size, with 
              2g to process for its storage, and 2g for operating system components. 
            </p>
            <p>0-4M MS-DOS Compatibility Arena </p>
            <p>The lower 4m is reserved for real-mode device drivers, TSRs and 
              16-bit applications. </p>
            <p>4M-2G 32-Bit Windows Applications (Private Arena) </p>
            <p>This area is reserved for 32-bit Windows applications, which receive 
              their own unique address space. </p>
            <p>2G-3G DLLs and Shared Objects (Shared Arena) </p>
            <p>This area is used to share core system components, shared DLLs, 
              and 16-bit Windows applications. </p>
            <p>3G-4G Reserved System Area </p>
            <p>Ring 0 components are mapped into this area; this area is not accessible 
              by Ring 3 components. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Threads and Processes </p>
            <p>Thread - The basic entity to which the operating system allocates 
              access to the CPU. </p>
            <p>Process - The code, data and resources which makeup an application. 
              Each process contains at least one thread that execute's the process 
              code. </p>
            <p><br>
              Thread Priorities - Used to determine which thread will be allowed 
              to run next. Each thread can have a priority number between 0 and 
              31 with 31 being the highest priority. The ranges of 0-31 are for 
              NT compatibility. The priority values are divided into two sections: 
              0-15 for variable priority threads, and 16-31 for fixed priority 
              threads. </p>
            <p>Thread Scheduling - there are three states a thread can be in: 
            </p>
            <p>Ready - Thread is ready to be executed by the scheduler. <br>
              Waiting - Thread is waiting for an event to occur to come into the 
              ready state. <br>
              Running - Thread is running; only one thread can be running at one 
              time. </p>
            <p><br>
              Primary Scheduler - Responsible for making sure the highest priority 
              thread is running. </p>
            <p>Secondary Scheduler - Makes sure no thread hogs the CPU. </p>
            <p><br>
              Multitasking </p>
            <p>Preemptive multitasking - The O/S divides time into slices (20ms 
              for Win95) and proportions the evenly between runnin applications. 
            </p>
            <p>Cooperative multitasking - Applications are required to give up 
              control of the CPU and let other applications take their turn. Some 
              applications tend to hog the CPU using this method. </p>
            <p>Multithreading - Used by the preemptive multitasking in Win95 to 
              allow an application to have multiple paths of execution (threads). 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Video </p>
            <p>VGA fallback - ensures an incompatible video driver will not prevent 
              you from accessing the system. For this to work, there must be a 
              line in the [boot] section of the system.ini reading -- DisplayFallback=0 
            </p>
            <p>The color depth is measured in bpp (bits per pixel). The following 
              is a chart relative to the realtionship between bpp and color depth. 
            </p>
            <p>Color Depth BPP (Bits per Pixel) <br>
              16 colors 4 <br>
              256 colors 8 <br>
              32k colors (16-bit) 15 <br>
              64k colors (16-bit) 16 <br>
              16.7 million colors 24 </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Printing </p>
            <p>Image Color Matching - Allows applications to provide closer matches 
              for color between graphics displayed on the screen and the same 
              graphics when they are printed. Each devices properties are stored 
              in a profile. These profiles were designed by InterColor 3.0 (a 
              number of vendors which included Kodak, Microsoft, Apple, Silicon 
              graphics, etc.). </p>
            <p>Bidirectional printing - Allows two-way communications between 
              the printer and computer. The printer is able to send status and 
              diagnostic information to the computer and its operating system. 
            </p>
            <p>What is needed for bidirectional printing: </p>
            <p>A bidirectional printer <br>
              An IEEE 1284 compliant printer cable <br>
              A bidirectional printer port on the computer </p>
            <p><br>
              Printer Drivers </p>
            <p>Unidrv.dll - Printer driver which is used to print to all non-postscript 
              printers. </p>
            <p>Friendly Names - Allows printer to be named with a &quot;normal&quot; 
              name which is up to 32 characters in length. </p>
            <p>EMF Spooling - Increases performance in the way the computer spools 
              print jobs to the temporary file and allows the application to return 
              to a usable state quicker. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>MS-DOS application printing support </p>
            <p>Windows 3.x and DOS-based files have been known to have printing 
              problems in Windows 95. The problem is that the program will say 
              that it has spooled the print job to the printer, but the printer 
              never receives the job. The problem is being caused by the programs 
              inability to understand the Windows 95 printing system. Windows 
              95 has included an MS-DOS printing compatibility feature to allow 
              older programs to print to a virtual LPT port. Windows 95 will map 
              an LPT port to the desired print queue which the older program recognizes. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Printer Icons </p>
            <p>Every printer has an icon which refers to how it is used to print: 
            </p>
            <p>Printer icon with a hand icon - local printer which is shared <br>
              Printer icon alone - local printer unshared <br>
              Printer icon with cable attached to bottom - network printer <br>
              Printer icon with diskette - printer which is set to print to a 
              file <br>
              Point-and-print - the method of using drag and drop to print a document. 
              For example, you can create a shortcut to a printer on your desktop. 
              Then, you can take a MS Word document and drag it to the printer 
              icon. This will then print the document without the need to start 
              the application. </p>
            <p><br>
              Networking </p>
            <p>See the Networking Essentials page to study the OSI model. The 
              OSI model is relavant to networking with Win95. </p>
            <p>Universal Naming Convention (UNC) - Universal network pathname 
              which is integrated into Win95. Named as \\computername\sharename. 
              The \\computername will be the name given to your computer in the 
              network properties screen. The \sharename will be the name you give 
              to a directory when you share it. </p>
            <p>Browse Master - A computer on the network which is designated to 
              maintain an active list of all computers in the workgroup. Win95 
              can be designated as having the Browse Master disabled (cannot be 
              a browse server), enabled (will be a browse server) or automatic 
              (will become a browse server if necessary). In a client/server environment, 
              it is best to keep the Browse Master disabled as it has been known 
              to cause conflicts with servers acting as the Browse Master. </p>
            <p><br>
              Security levels </p>
            <p>Share-level security - Used in Windows 95 to share resources. A 
              password is needed to access the resource. </p>
            <p>User-level security - Used in Windows NT to share resources. When 
              you attempt to access a shared resource, the server will make sure 
              your user account has been authorized to access the resource. User-level 
              security can be implemented in </p>
            <p>Windows 95 if specified in the Network Properties menu under the 
              Access Control tab. </p>
            <p><br>
              Networking with Novell Netware </p>
            <p>Novell Netware typically uses the IPX (AKA NWLink) protocol for 
              network communications. Novell Netware 4.11 has TCP/IP capabilties. 
              Frame type describes the format used to encapsulate IPX packets, 
              and must be the same on connecting systems. <br>
              Novell Netware by default does not support long file names. To enable 
              long file names on your netware server, enable OS/2 name space (HPFS). 
              <br>
              Client for Netware is needed for connecting to Novell Netware servers. 
              <br>
              Client for Netware uses NCP (Netware Core Protocol) as the redirector. 
              <br>
              ODI is Novell's version of NDIS. <br>
              File and Print sharing for Netware is needed when sharing files 
              to other Netware clients. This requires user-level securit for pass-through 
              authentication to a Netware server. <br>
              NetWare servers advertise their services using the Service Advertising 
              Protocol (SAP) to make broadcasts over the network. Routers will 
              maintain a database of available NetWare servers. </p>
            <p><br>
              NetWare commands </p>
            <p>syscon - administers accounting, file server, user and group information. 
            </p>
            <p>filer - configures volume, file, and directory information. </p>
            <p>pconsole - manages NetWare print queues. </p>
            <p>netadmin - manages NDS services. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>TCP/IP </p>
            <p>TCP/IP is an internet protocol currently used for most networking 
              situations. Each computer using TCP/IP will contain a unique address 
              in a x.x.x.x format (where each x equals a number between 0 and 
              255) and a subnet mask. </p>
            <p>Subnet mask - A value that is used to distinguish the network ID 
              portion of the IP address from the host ID. </p>
            <p>Default gateway - A TCP/IP address for the host which you would 
              send packets to to be sent elsewhere on the network. </p>
            <p>Common TCP/IP problems are caused by incorrect subnet masks and 
              default gateways. </p>
            <p>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - Win95 contacts an 
              NT Server running this service to automatically obtain an IP address 
              each time it logs onto the network. </p>
            <p><br>
              Name Resolving </p>
            <p>Win95 uses three methods to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses: 
            </p>
            <p>broadcasts - a computer will broadcast the NetBIOS name it is searching 
              for across the network. The machine with the mataching NetBIOS name 
              will send a reply to the broadcasting computer with its IP address. 
              <br>
              LMHOSTS - a file normally located in the windows directory which 
              contains a list of frequently used IP address and hostnames. <br>
              WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service) - Win95 contacts an NT Server 
              running these services to dynamically resolve NetBIOS names to IP 
              addresses. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Server-Based Setup </p>
            <p>Windows 95 can use a server-based setup to be installed from a 
              server. This will keep most or all of the files on a server, which 
              your PC will connect to upon each boot. </p>
            <p>Machine Directory - directory on server which stores computer-specific 
              configuration files (system.dat, user.dat, .ini files, etc.) for 
              a PC. Is mandatory to use when the PC does not have a hard drive. 
              Machine directory can be shared for multiple PCs with the same configuration. 
            </p>
            <p>Shared installation files can be stored in one of three places: 
            </p>
            <p>Startup disk - Boot disk which contains mini-registry which will 
              give it enough information to boot to the network/shared server. 
            </p>
            <p>Shared installation directory - Contains all Win95 filesand is 
              flagged as read-only. </p>
            <p><br>
              You can use Batch.exe (located in the admin\nettools\netsetup directory 
              on the CDROM) to create batch setup scripts for use after the installation. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Advanced Administration </p>
            <p>User Profiles - user preference settings which are stored locally 
              or on the server, which are reloaded to the system everytime the 
              user logs in. The settings can be specified to contain user preferences 
              for the Start Menu, Network </p>
            <p>Neighborhood, and the desktop settings. User Profiles can be enabled 
              via the Passwords Properties menu in the Control Panel. </p>
            <p>Policies - settings which are controlled by the administrator to 
              control what the user is able to do on their computer. To use policies, 
              you must have User Profiles enabled. Changes are made to Policies 
              by using the System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) which is located 
              on the Win95 CD. Policies can be setup for individuals, groups, 
              and also computers. Policies can be stored locally or on the server. 
              The default policy file is config.pol. To use this across the network, 
              the file must be placed in the NETLOGON share of the Primary Domain 
              Controller on a Windows NT network. </p>
            <p>Net Watcher - program which enables the administrator to remotely 
              view a PC and view the active connections, shares and open files. 
              Is available when the net watcher service installed in Network Properties. 
              Does not require user-level security. </p>
            <p>Remote Registry Editor - enables abililty to remotely edit the 
              registry within regedit.exe. Is only available if the PC has user-level 
              security enabled, and the remote registry service installed in Network 
              Properties. </p>
            <p>Remote Administration - administration tool which enables the administrator 
              to gain access to a remote PC's file system. To use this, you must 
              have Remote Administration enabled in the Passwords Properties menu 
              in the Control Panel under the </p>
            <p>Remote Administration tab. To gain access to this utility, enter 
              Network Neighboorhood, right-click on the computer you would like 
              to administer, and click on Properties. In the next window, click 
              the Administer button. </p>

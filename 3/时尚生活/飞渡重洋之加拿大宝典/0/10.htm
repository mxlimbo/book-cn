            <p>　　证明材料一般出自有关单位，文字应规范、严谨，并加盖有效印章。申请者应提供的证明材料主要有以下几种：</p>
            <p>　　1 学历、学位证明，主要是大学、研究生毕业证书，硕士学位证书，博士学位证书；</p>
            <p>　　2.成绩单，成绩单是任何申请人都必须提供的，我国大专院校的成绩评定大多采用百分制，而美国则以采用等级制为多，其平均值通常用平均成绩点数（GPA）表示，因此，必须注明所采用的记分方法，最好能提自己在班级所排名次，现在，美国大多数学校都要求申请者通过ETS直接提供TOEFL或GRE成绩：</p>
            <p>　　3. 财力证明；</p>
            <p>　　4. 体检表和健康证明，一般应由指定级别的医院出具；</p>
            <p>　　5. 学业（术）奖励和工作证明，一般学校尽管不作要求，但获得过奖励和有过实际工作经验的申请者，在录取时必定会得到优先考虑，这一点在申请助教、助研及奖学金时尤为重要。</p>

              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Ah, now I'd like to make a little side-bet with you: five hundred 
              says you don't come up with the story. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe takes out the paper, unfolding it and taking a good look at 
              the front page again)</p>
            <p>What are you lookin' at that for? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Oh, I just wanna see what time it is. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Er, what day it is, er--</p>
            <p>(puts the paper away)</p>
            <p>It's a deal! </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Now I'd </p>
            <p><br>
              (offering his hand)</p>
            <p>(you)</p>
            <p>to shake. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe pauses then shakes. Hennessy laughs and Joe smiles with him)</p>
            <p>Now, let's see, you're into me for about five hundred; when you 
              lose this bet you'll owe me a thousand. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Laughing)</p>
            <p>Why, you poor sucker, I'll practically own you! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>You have practically owned me for a couple of years now, but that's 
              all over. </p>
            <p><br>
              (As Hennessy continues laughing, leaning on the desk)</p>
            <p>I'm gonna win that money and with it I'm gonna buy me a </p>
            <p>(one way ticket)</p>
            <p>back to </p>
            <p>(New York!)</p>

              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Go on, go on--I'll love to hear you whine! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>And when I'm in a real newsroom I'll enjoy thinking about you, 
              sitting here with an empty leash in your hands and nobody to twitch 
              for you! </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(stopping Joe, who stops in the doorway to face him)</p>
            <p>So long, </p>
            <p><br>
              (raises his right hand, his finger and thumb in an 'O')</p>
            <p>Peachy. </p>

            <p>(Outside Joe's apartment. Giovanni paces outside the door, a gun 
              strapped to him, copying the actions of a sentry. A crowd of children 
              sitting on the stairwell make fun of him. He goes after them, telling 
              them off and they back away, shouting and laughing. As the children 
              sit back down on the stairs Joe enters the open door leading outside 
              and walks up the stairs, carefully avoiding the children, playfully 
              batting one of them on the head with his newspaper.)</p>
            <p><br>
              GIOVANNI</p>
            <p>(as Joe arrives at the top)</p>
            <p>What's your problem? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Everything ok, Giovanni? </p>
            <p><br>
              GIOVANNI</p>
            <p>(reassuring him, proudly)</p>
            <p>Listen here, Joe: er, nobody is come, nobody is go; absolutely 
              nobody. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Swell! thanks a lot. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He is about to go into his apartment but stops, turning to Giovanni)</p>
            <p>Oh er, Giovanni, er... </p>
            <p><br>
              (Putting his arm round him, leading him to the side)</p>
            <p>How would you like to make some money? </p>
            <p><br>
              GIOVANNI</p>
            <p>Money? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Giovanni responds in agreement in Italian.)</p>
            <p>That's the stuff. Now look, I've got a sure thing: double your 
              money back in two days. </p>
            <p><br>
              GIOVANNI</p>
            <p>(suspiciously)</p>
            <p>Double my money? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah well, I need a little investment capital to swing the deal. 
              Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash, I--. </p>
            <p><br>
              GIOVANNI</p>
            <p>(says some Italian.)</p>
            <p>You owing me tomorrow's rent (JOE I know, I know, I know.) and 
              you want me to lend you money? (JOE Yeah.) </p>
            <p><br>
              (Emphatically)</p>
            <p>No, </p>
            <p><br>
              (Some Italian)</p>
            <p>no! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(pointing his paper at him)</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, you'll be sorry! </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe goes through his front door, seeing Princess Ann still asleep 
              in his bed. He shuts the door quietly, fastening the chain across, 
              also. Joe stands looking at her for a moment then moves round to 
              the other side of the bed--the side she is facing lying down. He 
              stands above her, looking at her face then looking again at the 
              newspaper picture to compare them. He sits down beside her and moves 
              a lock of her out of the way to get a better view of her face. He 
              holds the picture up beside her but her hand still partially covers 
              her face. He tickles her hand and she moves it restlessly. He leans 
              closer to her:)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(quietly)</p>
            <p>Your Highness? </p>
            <p><br>
              (She stirs with a &quot;Mmmm-mmmmm&quot;.)</p>
            <p>Your </p>
            <p>(Royal)</p>
            <p>Highness? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(turning to her other side, sighing)</p>
            <p>Yes... what is it? </p>
            <p>(Joe sits up in delight, the fact of her identity passing through 
              his mind. He stands up, excitedly putting the newspaper back in 
              his pocket, and walks around the bed. Seeing the alarm clock on 
              the cupboard missing he picks it up from the bed and replaces it. 
              He replaces the pillow in its proper place, smoothing out the sheets 
              then walks back around to Princess Ann. He carefully picks up her 
              left arm, putting it around his neck, then slides his arms under 
              her head and legs and carries her--blankets included--around to 
              the other side of the bed. He is about to put her down but sees 
              that she is holding her the wrong way. All of a sudden he hears 
              police sirens sound outside and stops for a moment, then, still 
              holding her, picks up the pillow with one hand and puts it at the 
              other end of the bed, laying her down gently. She continues sleeping 
              as he goes over to the window and looks down at the street at some 
              police cars coming into view around a corner. Looking back anxiously 
              at the Princess he goes back in.)</p>

              there anything you want? </p>

            <p>Yes? well tell the doctor (ANN So many--). Tell the good doctor

            <p>Mmmmm, I dreamt and I dreamt... </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yes? Well, er, what did you dream? </p>

            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I dreamt I was asleep on the street and... young man came and he 
              was tall and strong and--</p>
            <p>(screwing her face up)</p>
            <p>he was so mean to me. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>He was? </p>

            <p>Mmmm. </p>

              (Blissfully; putting her arm over her eyes)</p>
            <p>It was wonderful. </p>
            <p>(She opens her arms, stretching a little. Lying face-up, not quite 
              awake yet, she looks at the ceiling, seeing the plumbing visible 
              in the corner--quite different to the ornamentation of the Embassy 
              bedchamber. Then she looks at Joe standing over her. She closes 
              her eyes, smiling, then opens them again, her expression becoming 
              severe as she stares at him.)</p>

              JOE</p>

              it. She looks at him all the while, not fully trusting of him.)</p>

            <p>Are these yours? </p>

              pyjama bottoms.)</p>

              JOE</p>

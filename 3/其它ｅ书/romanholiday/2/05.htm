            <p>(still working on her buttons)</p>
            <p>How terribly nice. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Hey, hey: </p>
            <p><br>
              (bringing the pyjamas from the bed, presenting them to her)</p>
            <p>these are pyjamas; they're to sleep in; you're to climb into them, 
              you understand? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(taking them)</p>
            <p>Thank you. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>And you do your sleeping on the couch, see?--not on the bed, not 
              on the chair: on the couch; is that clear? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Do you know my favorite poem? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Ah, you already recited that for me. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He goes to get some blankets from the bed.)</p>

            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>If you just keep your mind off the poetry and on the pyjamas, everything'll 
              be alright; see? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>It's Keats. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>I'll be-- it's Shelley. I'll be back in about ten minutes. </p>

              ANN</p>

            <p><br>
              (She shakes her head, looking at the pyjamas slightly confused. 
              Thinking better of it, Joe takes the bottle and places it on top 
              of the tall cupboard on the other side of the door. He opens the 
              door and goes through. Ann turns to face him)</p>
            <p>You have my permission to </p>
            <p><br>
              (her skirt slides down)</p>

            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(stopping in the doorway)</p>
            <p>Thank you very much. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He goes out; Ann resumes her task of getting undressed.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (At the Embassy. The Ambassador is sat at a table, the Countess 
              in a chair in front and the General standing next to her. All are 
              in their bedclothes. A man marches to the desk.)</p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Well? </p>
            <p><br>
              SERVANT</p>
            <p>No trace, Your Excellency. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Have you searched the grounds? </p>
            <p><br>
              SERVANT</p>
            <p>Every inch, Sir, from the attics to the cellar. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>I must put you on your honor not to speak of this to anyone. I 
              must remind you that the Princess is the direct heir to the throne. 
              This must be classified as top-crisis secret. Have I your pledge? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              SERVANT</p>
            <p>Yes, Sir. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Very well. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The man turns and marches out. He turns to the other two.)</p>
            <p>Now we must notify Their Majesties. </p>
            <p>(The General looks up at him, worried; the Countess looks up at 
              the General, standing, and turning to the Ambassador who looks at 
              them, waiting for an affirmation. Receiving none, he stands up himself 
              and walks from behind the desk.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe arrives back at his apartment building, closes the outside 
              door, and walks up the stairwell. He unlocks the front door and 
              walks in.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(about to say something)</p>
            <p>A--. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Disappointed on seeing her asleep in his bed)</p>
            <p>Oh... </p>
            <p>(Looking at her, he slams the door shut, hard, but she doesn't 
              move a muscle. He goes over to the other side of the bed and moves 
              the table out of the way, making room. Then brings the ottoman over 
              and places it next to her. He takes off his jacket, puts it down 
              and loosens his tie. Then he grabs the undersheet beneath her and 
              then, calculating, lifts it up quickly, throwing her from the bed 
              and onto the ottoman. She stirs slightly after the disturbance, 
              resuming her comfortable position.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(muttering)</p>
            <p>So happy. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>The pleasure's mine. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He puts the pillow on the other end of the bed, muttering as he 
              goes to get undressed)</p>
            <p>Ah, screwball. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(The newspapers are turning out reports. A machine types out the 
              following bulletin: &quot;A SPECIAL EMBASSY BULLETIN REPORTS THE 
              SUDDEN ILLNESS OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS ANN.&quot;)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Daytime. A clock in the city strikes 12 noon. Waken by the clock, 
              Joe stirs in his bed. As the clock continues to ring he rises in 
              bed, looking out the window as the sunlight streams in. He grabs 
              an alarm clock, looking at the time, and shaking it.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Holy smoke, the Princess interview--</p>
            <p>(Ann stirs, half-asleep, with a questioning &quot;hmmm?&quot;)</p>
            <p>eleven forty-five. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Ann makes annoyed noises as she buries herself back into the pillow)</p>
            <p>Oh, shut up. </p>
            <p>(Joe jumps up, pulling the curtain back to see outside. He rushes 
              to the wardrobe but stops, going through his clothes laid over the 
              chair, retrieving a piece of paper. He puts it back as goes back 
              to the wardrobe to get his clothes.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Outside the window of an American News Service office. Mr. Hennessy 
              comes to the window, looking down onto the street several stories 
              down to see Joe getting out of a taxi, hurriedly paying the driver. 
              He then sits at his desk, looking through the morning papers. The 
              headline of the Rome American article, accompanied by a picture 
              of the Princess, reads: &quot;Princess Ann Taken Ill: Press Interview 
              Cancelled&quot;. Another paper, in Italian, has an article, also 
              with a picture of the Princess.)</p>
            <p>(Joe arrives in the newsroom, reaching for a phone on a desk.)</p>
            <p><br>
              NEWSMAN</p>
            <p>Hi, Joe. </p>
            <p><br>
              SECRETARY</p>
            <p>Good morning, Joe. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Hello, honey. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He goes over to the secretary, borrowing a drink of her coffee 
              as she holds it.)</p>
            <p><br>
              SECRETARY</p>
            <p>Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Uh-oh. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He takes some bread from her desk, ripping off a piece and giving 
              it to her, keeping the rest)</p>
            <p>Thanks a lot, hon. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He knocks on the door behind the secretary.)</p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(from inside, angrily)</p>
            <p>Come in. </p>
            <p>(Joe braces himself, exchanging a worried glance with the secretary, 
              and then marches confidently into the office.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(taking a mouthful as he shuts the door behind him; walking to 
              Hennessy's desk)</p>
            <p>You've been looking for me? </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Just coming to work? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(innocently)</p>
            <p>Who, me? </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>We start our days at eight-thirty in this office; we pick up our 
              assignments--. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>I picked up mine last night. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>What assignment was that? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>The Princess, eleven forty-five. </p>

              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(mouth open)</p>
            <p>You've already been to the interview? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, sure; I just got back. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Taking another mouthful.)</p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Well, well, well; all my apologies. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(turning to leave)</p>
            <p>'S alright. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(stopping him)</p>
            <p>Er, this is very interesting. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(trying to get away again)</p>
            <p>Nah, just routine. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Tell me, tell me: did she answer all the questions on the list?

            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, of course she did. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Rummaging through his pockets)</p>
            <p>I've got 'em right here, somewhere. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Er, don't disturb yourself; I have a copy here. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Looking at the piece of paper)</p>
            <p>How did Her Highness react to the idea of a European Federation? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>She thought it was just fine. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>She did? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(seeing the need to flesh it out, leaning against the desk in thought)</p>
            <p>Well, she thought that there'd be...two effects. </p>

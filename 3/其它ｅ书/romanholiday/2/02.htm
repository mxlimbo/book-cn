            <p>(Later, the Countess enters the bedchamber, followed by Doctor 
              Bonnachoven and the General. They walk to her bed and the doctor 
              looks at Ann, who doesn't move.)</p>

              DOCTOR</p>

              COUNTESS</p>
            <p>She was in hysterics three minutes ago, Doctor. </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>(he puts his Doctor's bag on the table and bends over to her; quietly)</p>
            <p>Are you asleep, ma'am? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(without moving)</p>
            <p>No! </p>

            <p>Oh. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He feels her forehead then takes a thermometer from his bag)</p>
            <p>I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness a moment, ah? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I'm very ashamed, Doctor Bonnachoven; I-</p>
            <p>(the Doctor places the thermometer in her mouth)</p>
            <p>suddenly I was crying. </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>(reassuring)</p>
            <p>To cry--a perfectly normal thing to do. </p>
            <p><br>
              GENERAL</p>
            <p>It most important she be calm and relaxed for the press conference, 
              Doctor. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Don't worry, Doctor: I-</p>
            <p>(takes the thermometer out)</p>
            <p>I'll be calm and relaxed and I-I'll bow and I'll smile and- I'll 
              improve trade relations and I, and I will.. </p>
            <p><br>
              (she throws herself onto the pillow, in hysterics again.)</p>
            <p><br>
              COUNTESS</p>
            <p>There she goes again. Give her something, Doctor, please. </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>(holding up a syringe from the bag)</p>
            <p>Uncover her arm, please, hmm? </p>
            <p>(The Countess uncovers her arm as the General looks away.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(calming down; without looking up)</p>
            <p>What's that? </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>Sleep and calm. This will relax you and make Your Highness feel 
              a little happy. It's a new drug, quite harmless. </p>
            <p><br>
              (As he injects her the General faints behind them, unnoticed)</p>
            <p>There. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I don't feel any different. </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>You will; it may take a little time to take hold. Just now, lie 
              back, ah? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Can I keep just one light on? </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>Of course. Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for 
              a while. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(smiling)</p>
            <p>Thank you, Doctor. </p>
            <p><br>
              COUNTESS</p>
            <p>(the Countess looks round at the General on the floor)</p>
            <p>Oh, the General! Doctor, quick! </p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>Oh! </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(sitting up)</p>
            <p>Hah! </p>
            <p><br>
              (she puts her hand over her mouth, covering her smile.)</p>
            <p><br>
              GENERAL</p>
            <p>(embarrassed; straightening his bedrobe)</p>
            <p>I'm perfectly alright. </p>
            <p><br>
              (To the Princess)</p>
            <p>Goodnight, ma'am. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He bows and leaves.)</p>
            <p><br>
              DOCTOR</p>
            <p>(bowing, smiling at the Princess)</p>
            <p>Goodnight, ma'am. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Goodnight, Doctor. </p>
            <p>(The Doctor leaves, followed by the Countess, who turns off the 
              light and, looking back at the Princess, shuts the door behind her.)</p>
            <p>(Alone, the Princess looks around the large room at the lavish, 
              ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard. 
              She lies back, and then, remembering, eagerly climbs out of bed 
              and runs to the window. She looks out longingly at the dancing below, 
              the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city, the buildings 
              lit up in the night far in the distance. Thinking, she looks back 
              at the door and then back out the window, then she runs to her wardrobe, 
              and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(Later, dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up 
              her gloves from the dresser, she peers out the door of the bedchambers. 
              She sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his semi-sleep. 
              Pausing as she closes the door, she goes out of the side window 
              onto the balcony outside. She walks along to the edge of the adjacent 
              balcony, jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground. Glancing 
              furtively around she goes inside to a large, empty room. She pauses 
              for moment to look around on either side and then continues. Going 
              through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs, encircling 
              the large central area. She runs along to the end, turning the corner 
              and then onto the other side. She continues on, reaches a staircase 
              and goes down it towards the exit.)</p>
            <p>(Outside, still in the grounds of the Embassy, she runs along a 
              courtyard area. The shadow of a man walking appears where she has 
              just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he 
              can see her.)</p>
            <p>(Running through the buildings further she pauses, her back against 
              a wall. Looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small 
              supply truck. While he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into 
              the back of the truck. The man comes back and throws a couple of 
              bags into the back where she is hiding. He then gets in, starts 
              the motor, and drives off. Guards at the entrace of the Embassy 
              grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out. Ann peers 
              back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again 
              as the Embassy recede into the distance. She looks round with delight, 
              moving the bag out of the way, leaning her arm on some goods to 
              see out the back better. She watches the truck go past a sidewalk 
              cafe, busy with people, then waves to a couple driving behind on 
              a scooter; the woman waves back at her. The goods rattle in the 
              back as the truck bounces around, and Ann rests on a box, closing 
              her eyes.)</p>
            <p>(The truck continues through the city but Ann is awakened when 
              the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front. 
              As it is stopped she hops out, running to the footpath as the truck 
              screeches away. She leans against a tree, yawning then continues 
              on.)</p>
            <p>(Crossing a street, she walks straight across the passenger cabin 
              of a horse-drawn carriage parked alongside the pavement, to the 
              bewilderment of the passengers and driver. The cab drives away as 
              Ann continues on.)</p>
            <p>(A light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of 
              the building the carriage was parked in front of...)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p><br>
              (Inside the room are sat Joe Bradley, Irving Radovich, and several 
              other men around a poker table.)</p>

              CARD PLAYER 1</p>

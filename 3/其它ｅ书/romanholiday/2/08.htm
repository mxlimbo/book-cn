              back at him like a frightened gazelle.)</p>

            <p>I must get dressed and go! </p>

              (remembering, she grabs the blankets to cover herself.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(casually; continuing to prepare the coffee)</p>
            <p>Why? what's your hurry?--there's lots of time. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>Oh no, there isn't and I've- I've been quite enough trouble to

              JOE</p>
            <p>Trouble? </p>

            <p>I'll run a bath for you. </p>
            <p><br>
              (As he goes in to turn on the taps on the bath, Ann picks up her 
              clothes from the floor near the bathroom door, holding them to her 
              chest. After laying a towel out on the floor next to the bath he 
              comes back out, gesturing with his arm to her to go in)</p>
            <p>There you are. </p>
            <p>(Ann walks to the bathroom, keeping him in front of herself, turning 
              round to go through the door, then quickly turning around so as 
              to be able to see him as she shuts the door behind her.)</p>
            <p>(As soon as the door shuts, Joe goes over to the door and in trying 
              to open it gently, forgets the chain and causes a noise. He undoes 
              the chain and goes out and down the steps.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe goes into a workshop full of people working on sculptures. 
              He asks one of the men, in Italian, if he can use the phone. Joe 
              thanks him then dials. As he waits for the phone to be answered 
              Joe takes out the paper to look at the picture again.)</p>
            <p>(The phone rings in Irving Radovich's studio. He is lying on his 
              back holding a camera, next to a tub filled with water which produces 
              a ripple effect on the ceiling. On his leg is attached a piece of 
              string which runs up to a fishing rod, held by a model who sits 
              on the upper level of the studio, her legs sticking out through 
              the balcony.)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(aiming his camera)</p>
            <p>Here we go now. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He takes the picture)</p>
            <p>There you are; that does it. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Pulling himself off his back)</p>
            <p>Oh. </p>
            <p><br>
              (To the model, trying to put his leg down to untie the string as 
              she playfully pulls at the rod)</p>
            <p>Gimme a little slack, will ya? </p>
            <p><br>
              (He answers the phone)</p>
            <p>Pronto? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(impatiently)</p>
            <p>Irving! why won't you answer the phone? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Calmer)</p>
            <p>Look, this is Joe. Irving: can you get over here in about five 
              minutes? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(sitting back; the model dangles the line around his head)</p>
            <p>Oh no, I can't come now, Joe; I'm busy. Oh no--</p>
            <p>(playfully biting at the end of the line)</p>
            <p>Joe: I'm up to my ears in work. </p>
            <p><br>
              (To the model; covering the mouthpiece of the phone)</p>
            <p>Go on, get into your next outfit, will you, Honey?--the canoe. 
              What kind of a scoop, Joe? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Look, Irving, I can't talk over the telephone; one word in the 
              wrong quarter and this whole thing might blow sky-high. It's front 
              page stuff, that's all I can tell you. It might be political ro 
              it might be a sensational scandal--I'm not sure which, but it's 
              a big story and it's got to have pictures! </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>But I can't come now, Joe; I'm busy. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Looking up where the model is, in a lower tone to the phone)</p>
            <p>I'm busy now and I'm meeting Francesca at Rocca's in a half an 
              hour and--. </p>
            <p><br>
              (A charwoman enters Joe's apartment, carrying a bucket and mop. 
              She puts them down inside and closes the door, muttering a disdainful 
              &quot;Ah!&quot; at the sight of the bed in a mess. She walks to 
              the window and opens the curtains. Hearing the sound of water coming 
              from the bathroom she rushes over and opens the door, revealing 
              Ann just getting out of the bath, covered in a towel. She emits 
              a scream of surprise at the intrusion, pulling the towel up, as 
              the charwoman stands in the doorway, hands on hips. Ann tries to 
              excuse herself in Italian, shutting the door, but the charwoman 
              will have none of it and orders her outside, waving her finger at 
              Ann and strongly reprimanding her in Italian.)</p>
            <p><br>
              CHARWOMAN</p>
            <p>Capito? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>No capito--don't understand. </p>
            <p><br>
              CHARWOMAN</p>
            <p>Don't understand? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Ann runs back to the bathroom and the charwoman mutters more Italian 
              after her.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe runs up the stairwell and goes into his apartment. Looking 
              around, he doesn't see Ann--only his empty apartment tidied and 
              the bed made. He realises the balcony door is open and goes out 
              into the sun, finding Princess Ann looking out over the city.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>There you are! </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>I was looking at all the people out here. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Smiling, looking around the buildings)</p>
            <p>It must be fun to live in a place like this. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah, it has its moments. I can give you a running commentary on 
              each apartment. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(she turns to him, seriously)</p>
            <p>I must go. </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>Hmm? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I only waited to say goodbye. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Goodbye?--But we've only just met. How about some breakfast? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I'm sorry, I haven't time. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Must be a pretty important date to run off without eating. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>It is. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(walking her back to the apartment)</p>
            <p>Well, I'll go along with you, wherever you are going. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>That's alright, thank you; I can find the place. </p>
            <p><br>
              (They walk back inside)</p>
            <p>Thank you for letting me sleep in your bed. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Oh, that's alright; think nothing of it. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>It was very considerate of you--</p>
            <p>(motioning to the ottoman)</p>
            <p>you must have been awfully uncomfortable on that couch. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>No, no--do it all the time. </p>
            <p><br>
              (She smiles as he turns to open the door.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(as she goes out she turns to shake his hand)</p>
            <p>Goodbye, Mr. Bradley. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(shaking her hand)</p>
            <p>Goodbye. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Seeing her unsure about which way to go he points to the way out)</p>
            <p>Oh: go right through there and down all the steps. </p>
            <p>(She walks down the stairs and he goes back inside and shuts the 
              door, walking out to the balcony again. Ann goes through the outside 
              door, watched from above by Joe as she walks away. He runs back 
              inside and out his front door.)</p>
            <p>(Part-way down the outside steps, Ann stops and turns to run back 
              up. Joe, running to follow her almost runs into her.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(laughing as they stop on the steps)</p>
            <p>Well, small world. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Yes- I- I almost forgot: can you lend me some money? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(as Giovanni appears in the window of the building overlooking 
              the steps, opposite them)</p>
            <p>Oh, yeah; that's right, you didn't have any last night did you?

              JOE</p>
            <p>(as he reaches for his money he sees Giovanni watching)</p>
            <p>How much--</p>
            <p>(looking back up at Giovanni, uncomfortably)</p>
            <p>how much was it that you wanted? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Well, I don't know how much I need. How much have you got? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, er </p>
            <p><br>
              (looks quickly up at Giovanni,)</p>
            <p>suppose we just split this fifty-fifty: here's a thousand lira. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>A thousand?! Can you really spare all that? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>It's about a dollar and a half. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Oh... Well, I- I'll arrange for it to be sent back to you. What 
              is your address? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>

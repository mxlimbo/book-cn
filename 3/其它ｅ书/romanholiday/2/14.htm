              RADIO ANNOUNCER</p>
            <p>This is the American Hour, from Rome, broadcasting a special news 
              bulletin in English and Italian. Tonight there is no further word 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              (Ann stands up, walking to the radio; Joe stands still, his back 
              to her)</p>
            <p>from the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome, where she was taken ill 
              yesterday, on the last leg of her European goodwill tour. This has 
              given rise to rumours that her condition may be serious, which is 
              causing alarm and anxiety among the people in her country. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The radio starts to repeat the bulletin in Italian so Ann switches 
              it off.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>The news can wait till tomorrow. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yes. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(she walks to him)</p>
            <p>May I have a little more wine? </p>
            <p><br>
              (He pours her some more)</p>
            <p>Sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(as Ann drinks from the glass)</p>
            <p>Did you learn how in school? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Mmmm, I'm a good cook; I could earn my living at it. I can sew 
              too, and clean a house, and iron--I learned to do all those things, 
              I just haven't had the chance </p>
            <p><br>
              (slowing, turning away)</p>
            <p>to do it for anyone. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, looks like I'll have to move; and get myself a place with 
              a kitchen. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(she turns around to look at him, heart-broken)</p>
            <p>Yes </p>
            <p><br>
              (they look at each other for a moment then Ann looks down and drinks 
              the rest of her wine. Ann chokes back her sorrow)</p>
            <p>I... will have to go now. </p>
            <p><br>
              (She stands for a moment, Joe looking at her, then runs into his 
              arms, crying on his shoulder.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(comforting her)</p>
            <p>Anya... there's... something that I want to tell you. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>No, please </p>
            <p><br>
              (she looks at him and kisses him)</p>
            <p>nothing. </p>
            <p><br>
              (They hold each other for a moment then Ann looks down)</p>
            <p>I must go and get dressed. </p>
            <p>(Ann walks to the bathroom. Joe stands with his back to her, heart-broken. 
              He walks over to pick up his jacket and puts it on.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(Solemnly, without speaking, Joe drives Ann through Rome.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(looking straight ahead)</p>
            <p>Stop at the next corner, please. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>'K. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He slows down, stopping at a corner and leans forward to see the 
              Embassy gate visible down the street)</p>
            <p>Here? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(looking out her window)</p>
            <p>Yes. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Looking down, without looking at him)</p>
            <p>I have to leave you now. I'm going to that corner </p>
            <p><br>
              (she looks out,)</p>
            <p>there, and turn. You must stay in the car and drive away. Promise 
              not to watch me go beyond the corner. Just drive away and leave 
              me, as I leave you. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(solemnly)</p>
            <p>Alright. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(keeping back the tears)</p>
            <p>I don't know how to say goodbye. I can't think of any words. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Don't try. </p>
            <p>(They look at each other and she throws her self into his arms, 
              holding her tight. They kiss, passionately, then hold each other 
              for a few more moments and Ann cries against his shoulder. They 
              release, enough for her to turn around to look back down the street, 
              then she looks at back him. They manage a smile at each other and 
              then Ann looks down, unable to stay the inevitable. Turning away 
              from him, she opens the door and gets out. Without looking back 
              she starts off down the street, her walk turning into a run. Joe 
              watches her as she disappears round the corner. Joe looks out at 
              the empty street toward the gate and looking as if he might go after 
              her but, after a pause he looks away, glumly, then switches on the 
              engine and drives off.)</p>
            <p>(In the Embassy. Princess Ann stands in a large room across from 
              the others in their bedclothes: Ambassador; the Countess, who is 
              upset, wiping her nose with a handkerchief; and the General, who 
              stands grim-faced.)</p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Your Royal Highness: twenty-four hours--they can't all be blank. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>They are not. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>But what explanation am I to offer Their Majesties? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I was indisposed. I am better. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Ma'am: you must appreciate that I have my duty to perform, just 
              as Your Royal Highness has Her duty--. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Your Excellency: I trust you will not find it necessary to use 
              that word again. Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family 
              and my country, I would not have come tonight. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The look at her, in silence; after a pause, grimly)</p>
            <p>Or indeed ever again. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Ann walks across the room)</p>
            <p>Now, since I understand we have a very full schedule today, you 
              have my permission to withdraw. </p>
            <p><br>
              (They stand for a moment, then bow and walk away. At the door, the 
              Countess takes a tray from a servant)</p>
            <p>No milk and crackers. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The Countess gives them back, about to shut the door)</p>
            <p>That will be all, thank you, Countess. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The Countess bows in respect and then goes out, closing the door.)</p>
            <p>(Alone in the room the Princess walks slowly over to a window, 
              looking out over the city in silence.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(The next day, Joe sits in his apartment, looking out of his window 
              over the town. There is a knock at the door and Joe looks up, hopefully. 
              The knocking persists and he walks to the door slowly and opens 
              it, then turns around in disappointment.)</p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>

            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(turning back to him, hands in pockets)</p>

            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>What? But that's impossible! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Have a cup of coffee or something? </p>

            <p>(absently, pretending to busy himself with something on the desk)</p>
            <p>What are you talking about? </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>I know too much: First you come into my office and ask about an 
              exclusive on the Princess; next, you disappear; then I get the rumour 
              from my contact at the Embassy that the Princess isn't sick at all 
              and she's out on the town. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>What kind of a newspaper man are you? You believe every two-bit 
              rumour that comes your way? </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Yeah? And a lot of other rumours: about a shindig at a barge down 
              by the river </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe looks up, his eyes brightening at the recollection)</p>
            <p>and the arrest of eight Secret Service men from a country which 
              shall be nameless. And then comes of news of the lady's miraculous 
              recovery. It all adds up! And don't think by playing hard-to-get 
              that you're raised the price of that story: a deal's a deal! </p>
            <p><br>
              (Pushing him out of the way, rummaging through the papers on his 
              desk)</p>
            <p>Now, come on, come on, come on: where is that story? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>I have no story </p>

              HENNESSY</p>

              IRVING</p>
            <p>(loudly, approaching from outside)</p>

            <p>You did--I spoke to you about that once before, don't you remember? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Joe, look at my pants! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(pulling him by the arm to the bathroom)</p>
            <p>Yeah, you better come in here and dry 'em off, Irving. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(protesting, pulling away from him)</p>
            <p>Aww, knackers to that. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Smiling)</p>
            <p>Hey, did you tell him about Smithy? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Irving. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Smithy? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Oh ho! Mr. Hennessy (JOE Irving.), wait till you--</p>
            <p>(Joe trips him as he walks to Mr. Hennessy.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>There you go again, Irving. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(getting up, steaming)</p>
            <p>Joe. Listen, th--. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Hey, alright, save that till later; you're here early anyway. Why 
              don't you go home and </p>
            <p>(shave!)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(putting a hand on his beard)</p>
            <p>Shave? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(walking over, putting his hat on)</p>
            <p>Hey, what kind of a routine is that? What are you guys up to? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Hands on hips)</p>
            <p>Who's Smithy? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(quickly)</p>
            <p>Oh, he's a guy that we met; you wouldn't care for him. </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(grabbing the envelope from Irving)</p>
            <p>What am I supposed to look at? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(quickly, grabbing the envelope back)</p>
            <p>Oh, just a couple of Irving's dames; you, you wouldn't like 'em. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              (Smiling; opening the envelope)</p>
            <p>Er, maybe you would... </p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>(stopping him)</p>
            <p>Don't change the subject! When you came back into my office, yesterday--. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon I thought I had a lead, but I was 
              wrong! That's all there is to it; there is no story </p>
            <p><br>
              (Irving looks at him, perplexed.)</p>
            <p><br>
              HENNESSY</p>
            <p>Ok; she's holding the press interview today, same time, same place--maybe 
              that's one story you can get. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He walks to the door, turning back, pointing a finger at him)</p>
            <p>And you owe me five hundred bucks! </p>

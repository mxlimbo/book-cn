              (Evening, it is dark. Music greets Joe and Ann as they walk down 
              the steps on the way to the barges. He pays the ticketseller as 
              Ann stands, watching the dancing across the river.)</p>

              JOE</p>

            <p>Grazzi. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He walks over to Ann, smiling to her and they continue.)</p>
            <p>(They walk onto the dance floor and start dancing.)</p>
            <p>(Two men in black suits and hats--Secret Service men--watch out 
              over the people. One of them turns to watch the dance floor and 
              notices Joe and Ann, watching them as they dance. The Secret Service 
              man stands on his feet and the other looks over at what he is watching. 
              As the music stops for the next song, the man speaks some Italian 
              to the other who leaves, and continues watching as the next dance 
              starts. The other man runs back towards the steps, away from the 
              dancers.)</p>
            <p>(Joe and Ann continue dancing--closer now as it is a slower song. 
              She rests her head on his shoulder, her eyes closed and smiling. 
              She looks up at him.)</p>

              ANN</p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>(as they look at each other)</p>
            <p>Hello. </p>
            <p>(Joe smiles as she rests her head against his chest and they continue.)</p>
            <p>(The band finishes the dance and the audience claps, the dancers 
              on the floor dispersing. Joe and Ann walk over to the side of the 
              floor.)</p>

              ANN</p>

            <p>Mr. Bradley: if you don't mind my saying so, I think you are a 
              ringer. </p>

              JOE</p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>You spent the whole day doing things I've always wanted to. Why? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(guiltily)</p>
            <p>I don't know. Seemed the thing to do. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I never heard of anybody so kind. </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>(he looks down, hiding his guilt)</p>
            <p>Wasn't any trouble. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Also completely unselfish. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(Joe looks over to the other side of the barge, motioning to Ann)</p>
            <p>Let's have a drink at the bar. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe takes her hand and they walk over.)</p>

              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>(turns to Ann, smiling)</p>
            <p>Oh! Finalmentez: there you are! </p>
            <p><br>
              (Remembering his manners to the woman apparently accompanying him)</p>
            <p>Er, scusatmitanto. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Turning immediately back to Ann)</p>
            <p>I look for you long time--I think maybe you not come </p>
            <p><br>
              (he pauses, noticing Joe standing just behind her, watching. He 
              motions to her hair.)</p>
            <p>Ah, off; all off! </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Oh, it's nice without, isn't it? Cool. </p>

              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>Oh, very, very good. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(introducing him)</p>
            <p>Mr. Bradley. </p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>I, Mario Delani. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Old friends? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Oh, yes; he cut my hair this afternoon. He invited me here, tonight. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(to Mario)</p>
            <p>Wha- what did you say the name was? </p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>(shaking Joe's hand)</p>
            <p>Delani, Mario Delani. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Mario Delani, I'm very glad to know you. </p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>(the band starts playing again)</p>
            <p>Me too. </p>
            <p><br>
              (To Ann, using his hands, unsure of his English)</p>
            <p>Oh, may I enjoy myself, er, the pleasure? </p>
            <p><br>
              (To Joe)</p>
            <p>Do you mind? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>No, no; go right ahead. </p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>Thank you. </p>
            <p>(Ann takes his hand and they go out on the floor to dance. Joe, 
              watches them dancing for a moment then takes out a notebook, quickly 
              writing something down. Irving arrives at the bottom of the steps, 
              saying something in Italian and holding up his camera as he walks 
              past. He walks towards the barges. The Secret Service man watches 
              Ann as she dances with Mario.)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(to Joe, at the bar)</p>
            <p>Ciao, Joe. Did I miss anything? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(quietly)</p>
            <p>You're just in time, pal. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Who's Smithy dancing with? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Barber--cut her hair this afternoon, made a date for tonight. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(musing as he watches them)</p>
            <p>'The Princess and the Barber'. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Mario and Ann continue dancing, having a great time.)</p>
            <p>(Irving walks around the other side of the bar, his camera placed 
              on the table, Joe hiding it from the view of the floor. The barman 
              protests but Irving reassures him, keeping his eyes on Ann. Irving 
              watches, waiting, and then, with a signal, Joe jumps away and the 
              bulb flashes as Irving takes the picture. In an instant Joe jumps 
              back, nonchalantly looking up at the sky while Irving takes his 
              glass, doing the same.)</p>
            <p>(Ann looks out across the floor and then, seeing Joe and Irving, 
              waves. Irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement.)</p>
            <p>(On the bridge, up above the dancing, several cars pull up. Several 
              men climb out, rushing over to the steps. The first Secret Service 
              man, smoking a cigarette, watches the men approach. The men walk 
              over to the tables.)</p>
            <p>(Ann continues dancing with Mario who suddenly stops, looking at 
              her hair.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>What is it? </p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>Moment. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He stops, thinking, and then, taking out a comb, brushes her fringe 
              apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat 
              tufts. He puts his comb away, satisfied. Ann moves to touch her 
              hair but Mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue 
              dancing.)</p>
            <p>(One of the Secret Service men stands leaning against a structure, 
              swinging his hand to the beat, smiling. The man watching behind 
              rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls 
              his hat down, putting his hands in his pockets, looking out again 
              over the dancing.)</p>
            <p>(The music stops and everyone applauds the musicians.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>Thank you. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The first Secret Service man comes over to Ann then Mario, seeing 
              him, says something to Ann in Italian, then &quot;Bye&quot;, and 
              leaves her to him.)</p>
            <p>(Ann smiles slightly but nervously to the man and they start to 
              dance. They turn several times, then the man speaks in her ear.)</p>
            <p><br>
              SECRET SERVICE MAN</p>
            <p>Your Highness. </p>
            <p><br>
              (She looks at up him sharply, and tries to pull away but he holds 
              her)</p>
            <p>You'll dance quietly towards the entrance. There is a car waiting. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(desperately; trying to pull away)</p>
            <p>No. </p>
            <p><br>
              SECRET SERVICE MAN</p>
            <p>Your Highness, please. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(as he forces her over to the side)</p>
            <p>You- you've made a mistake. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Tells him in Italian, pretending, that she doesn't speak English)</p>
            <p>Let me go. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Loudly)</p>
            <p>Will you let me go! </p>
            <p><br>
              (Shouting)</p>
            <p>Mr. Bradley! </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe looks up and starts toward her, looking for her in the dancers)</p>
            <p>Let me go, will you? Mr. Bradley! </p>
            <p>(Irving looks around from his drink and, seeing the problem, rushes 
              after Joe. Two of the Secret Service men drag Ann away from the 
              barges but Joe catches them and pushes them away, pushing one of 
              them down, and taking Ann by the arm. Joe punches one man who tries 
              to pull Ann the other way but the other one manages to push Irving 
              over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water. Joe and 
              Ann run to the other side of the floor, where the dancers have dispersed 
              and are watching the action.)</p>
            <p>(Joe sees more Secret Service coming from the other side so he 
              runs back the other way. Cornered, he confronts them head-on as 
              they close, Ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side. 
              Ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and 
              the crowd cheers. Irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men, 
              having his beard pulled, but responds to this with an angry punch 
              to the face. Mario runs over his hair with his comb, muttering some 
              Italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to 
              help Joe. The conductor of the band motions to the musicians to 
              start playing and they respond with an energetic tune. The scene 
              of chaos continues, Joe and Irving and Mario laying into the Secret 
              Service men. Distracted, two of the men manage to grab Ann and drag 
              her away. Joe runs after, Irving following with his camera.)</p>
            <p>(Joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds 
              with a punch, freeing Ann. Ann looks around her for a way to help, 
              picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at Joe's man. Joe keeps 
              fighting with the man as Ann picks up a guitar lying near the band 
              and stands behind him, on a chair. One of the men starts towards 
              her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head, 
              then swings it down, hitting him full on the head, stunning him 
              for a moment.)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(excitedly, trying to get his camera ready, having missed the shot 
              the first time)</p>
            <p>Hit him again, Smithy! </p>
            <p>(The drummer rolls again as Ann swings the guitar back, then releasing 
              it and smashing it over the man's head--the camera flashing as she 
              does so.)</p>
            <p>(Police sirens sound and the Polizia arrive, packed into their 
              cars. As they spill out, Joe, Ann, and Irving start to leave the 
              scene, leaving the Secret Service men staggering or lying about 
              the dance floor, dazed.)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Joe, give me my car keys. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(to Irving; he stops, pointing at the police)</p>
            <p>Police, police. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction)</p>
            <p>The other side of the bridge. </p>
            <p>(As Joe and Ann run across the barges, Irving tries stalling the 
              men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him, 
              running to follow Ann. Joe and Ann run through a boathouse and on 
              reaching the other end walk along the outside edge, just above the 
              water.)</p>
            <p>(Unseen, a Secret Service man covers the outside of the boathouse 
              as they double back. Joe peers round the corner and the man surprises 
              him with a punch to the face, knocking him into the water. Ann knees 
              him in the groin and pushes him away. She holds her nose and dives 
              in after Joe, just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to 
              stop her. The Polizia arrest the remaining Secret Service men and 
              take them away, one of them being dragged by a guitar around his 
              neck, his head clean through the guitar. The band starts up again 
              and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across 
              the water, apparently after Joe and Ann as they swim away.)</p>
            <p>(Joe and Ann stagger out of the water, completely wet through. 
              Joe leads her to a rock where they sit down, Joe rubbing her around 
              the shoulders as she shivers.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Alright? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Fine. How are you? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Oh, fine! </p>
            <p><br>

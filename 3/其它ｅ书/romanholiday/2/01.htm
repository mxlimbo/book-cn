            <p>(A newsreel begins:)</p>
            <p>--PARAMOUNT NEWS--<br>
              NEWS FLASH </p>
            <p>(A commentator describes the newsreel showing Princess Ann at several 
              ceremonies in various European locations.)</p>
            <p><br>
              NEWSREEL</p>
            <p>Paramount News brings you a special coverage of Princess Ann's 
              visit to London, the first stop on her much publicised goodwill 
              tour of European capitals. She gets a royal welcome from the British 
              as thousands cheer the gracious young member of one of Europe's 
              oldest ruling families. After three days of continuous activity 
              and a visit to Buckingham Palace, Ann flew to Amsterdam where Her 
              Royal Highness dedicated the new International Aid Building and 
              christened an ocean liner. Then went to Paris where she attended 
              many official functions designed to cement trade relations between 
              her country and the Western European nations. And so to Rome, the 
              eternal city, where the Princess' visit was marked by a spectacular 
              military parade highlighted by the band of the crack Piersa Yeri 
              Regiment. The smiling young Princess showed no sign of the strain 
              of the week's continuous public appearances. And at her country's 
              embassy that evening, a formal reception and ball in her honor was 
              given by her country's ambassador to Italy. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(The Embassy ballroom. People fill the floor of the room. A fanfare 
              sounds. The Master of Ceremonies appears and the people clear a 
              path down the middle of the hall in front of him. The Master of 
              Ceremonies announces &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;--first in Italian, 
              then in English.)</p>
            <p>(The orchestra starts playing as the Master of Ceremonies walks 
              down the newly-formed aisle. Princess Ann, resplendent in her ballgown, 
              diamond tiara, and necklace, appears at the door accompanied by 
              the Ambassador in formal military dress. Behind them follow together 
              the Countess Vereberg and General Provno, and others. As the company 
              walks slowly down the aisle, Princess Ann smiles and nods her head 
              to acknowledge the guests who line their path. They bow as the Princess 
              walks past them.)</p>
            <p>(As they reach the front, the Princess and the others step onto 
              the dais as the orchestra finishes playing. The dais is furnished 
              with chairs--a large one in the center. The Princess and the others 
              stand, facing the guests. Princess Ann is about to sit when the 
              Ambassador discreetly stops her with a hand on her arm.)</p>
            <p>(As they stand waiting, the guests form in a line in front. The 
              Master of Ceremonies announces them as they walk forward to greet 
              her, in turn.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>His Excellency, the Papal Nuntius, Monsignor Altomonto. </p>
            <p>(Ann greets him warmly in Italian, shaking his hand; he replies, 
              in Italian.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>Sir Hugo Macy de Farmington. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(he bows to her)</p>
            <p>Good evening, Sir Hugo. </p>
            <p><br>
              SIR HUGO</p>
            <p>(shaking her hand)</p>
            <p>Good evening, Your Royal Highness. </p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>His Highness, The Maharajah of Kalipur; and The Rajkumari. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(shaking the Rajkumari's hand)</p>
            <p>I'm so glad that you could come. </p>
            <p><br>
              THE RAJKUMARI</p>
            <p>Thank you. </p>
            <p><br>
              THE MAHARAJA</p>
            <p>(shaking Ann's hand)</p>
            <p>Thank you, madame. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The Master of Ceremonies announes the next couple, in German.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(hidden beneath her dress, she takes her right foot out of its 
              shoe and stretches it)</p>
            <p>Guten Abend. </p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>(as Ann puts her foot back)</p>
            <p>Prince Istvan Barossy Nagyavaros. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>How do you do? </p>
            <p><br>
              (he kisses her hand)</p>
            <p>(The Master of Ceremonies announces the long German name and title 
              of the next guest.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(holding the woman's hand as she curtsies)</p>
            <p>Guten Abend. </p>
            <p><br>
              (She greets the man as he kisses her hand.)</p>
            <p>(The Master of Ceremonies announces the next couple. As she greets 
              them, Ann rubs her tired right foot against her leg.)</p>
            <p>(Much later on and Ann is still greeting the guests.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(greeting another couple)</p>
            <p>So happy. </p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>The Count and Countess von Marstrand. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Good evening, Countess </p>
            <p><br>
              (holding her hand the woman curtsies. To the Count.)</p>
            <p>Good evening. </p>
            <p><br>
              COUNT</p>
            <p>(kissing her hand)</p>
            <p>Good evening. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Suddenly, Princess Ann loses her balance as her foot slips over 
              her shoe, knocking it over. The Count's eyeglass pops out in surprise 
              and he smiles back as she regathers herself. The Ambassador looks 
              down in disappointment at her error. The Master of Ceremonies introduces 
              the next couple--a Senor and Senora.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(she tries to manipulate her shoe back into position which has 
              been knocked over and she greets the couple, disguising her discomfort)</p>
            <p>Good evening </p>
            <p><br>
              (the man kisses her hand.)</p>
            <p>(The Master of Ceremonies announces the next guest as Ann pushes 
              her shoe again in an effort to right it.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(as the man bends, gesturing with his hand in greeting)</p>
            <p>How do you do? </p>
            <p>(As the last guest moves back Ann looks around anxiously, trying 
              again to right her shoe, resulting in her pushing it further away. 
              The Ambassador then motions her to sit down. As she sits back into 
              the chair with the Ambassador and the Countess on either side her 
              dress pulls back, revealing the shoe.)</p>
            <p>(The orchestra starts playing a waltz. Ann tries as inconspicuously 
              as possible to drag her shoe back with her foot. The General, standing 
              behind her frowning, motions to the Countess to look at the shoe. 
              She looks down at it and closes her eyes in horror. The Princess 
              stirs in her seat trying to get her shoe back, fiddling with her 
              gloves as cover. A man standing behind the Ambassador motions to 
              him and he shrugs and gets up, bowing and presenting his arm to 
              the Princess. The Princess rises and, pausing for time to regather 
              her shoe, is lead onto the ballroom floor by the Ambassador. Taking 
              her up to dance he looks at the area in front of the eat and, relieved 
              that the shoe isn't to be seen, continues dancing with her as the 
              other guests watch. )</p>
            <p>(Later on and the dance floor is filled people. Princess Ann dances 
              with a short, lively gentleman who rattles off rapid Spanish phrases 
              to her. She listens, nodding and smiling politely. Still later and 
              she dances with a short, elderly gentlemen. They smile and nod to 
              each other silently. Later again and Ann dances with a somewhat 
              remote gentlemen. She almost speaks so as to strike up a conversation, 
              but thinks better of it.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(Later that night in Princess Ann's bedchamber. She stands on her 
              bed dressed in her nightgown, her hair let down. She picks up the 
              skirt of her nightgown and drops it.)</p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>(brushing her hair)</p>
            <p>I hate this nightgown. I hate all my nightgowns. And I hate all 
              my underwear too. </p>

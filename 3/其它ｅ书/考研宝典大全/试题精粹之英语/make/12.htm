              Passage l</p>
            <p> 　　It's a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break 
              a leg slipping on your doormat. Light up the stove and you could 
              burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to 
              warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you 
              for your troubles. Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, 
              when juries began holding more companies liable for their customers' 
              misfortunes.</p>
            <p> 　　Feeling threatened , companies responded by writing ever-longer 
              warning labels, trying to anticipate every possibLe accident. Today, 
              stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn, among other 
              things, that you might-surprise! ――fall off. The label on a child 
              ' s Batman cape cautions that the toy &quot;does not enable user 
              to fly. &quot;</p>
            <p> While warnings are often appropriate and necessary――the dangers 
              of drug interactions, for example――and many are required by state 
              or federal regulations, it isn't clear that they actually protect 
              the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. 
              About 50 percent of the companies lose when injured customers take 
              them to court.</p>
            <p> 　　Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims 
              continue as before, some courts are beginning to side with defendants, 
              especially in cases where a warning label probably</p>
            <p>wouldn't have changed anything. In May , Julie Nimmons, president 
              of Schutt Sports in Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving 
              a football player who was paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt 
              helmet. &quot;We' re really sorry he has become paralyzed , but 
              helmets aren' t designed to prevent those kinds of injuries , &quot; 
              says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the game, not the 
              helmet, was the reason for the athlete's injury. At the same time, 
              the American Law Institute――a group of judges, lawyers, and academics 
              whose recommendations carry substantial weight-issued new guidelines 
              for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of obvious 
              dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. &quot; 
              Important information can get buried in a sea of trivialities, &quot; 
              says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the 
              new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its 
              way, the information on products might actually be provided for 
              the benefit of customers and not as protection against legal liability.</p>
            <p>51 . What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?</p>
            <p>[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.</p>
            <p>[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.</p>
            <p>[C]Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.</p>
            <p>[D]Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies 
              promised.</p>
            <p>52. Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to__</p>
            <p>[A]satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products</p>
            <p>[B]become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products</p>
            <p>[C]make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability</p>
            <p>[D]feel obliged to view customers' safety as their first concern</p>
            <p>53. The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that__</p>
            <p>[A]some injury claims were no longer supported by law</p>
            <p>[B]helmets were not designed to prevent injuries</p>
            <p>[C]product labels would eventually be discarded</p>
            <p>[D]some sports games might lose popularity with athletes</p>
            <p>54. The author' s attitude towards the issue seems to be__</p>

              Passage 2</p>
            <p> 　　In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action 
              has revolved around efforts to tap the consumer market. More recently, 
              as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have started 
              to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business 
              sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what product 
              they're looking for.</p>
            <p> 　　Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because 
              of doubts about its reliability. &quot;Businesses need to feel they 
              can trust the pathway between them and the supplier, &quot; says 
              senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies 
              are limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with 
              established business partners who are given access to the company 
              ' s private internet .</p>
            <p> 　　Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns 
              the technology available for marketing. Until recently, Internet 
              marketing activities have focused on strategies to &quot;pull&quot; 
              cus-</p>
            <p>tomers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies 
              have developed tools that allow companies to &quot;push&quot; information 
              directly out to consumers , transmitting marketing messages directly 
              to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses 
              a screen saver to deliver a continualiy updated stream of news and 
              advertisements to subscribers' computer monitors. Subscribers can 
              customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly 
              to a company ' s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are 
              already starting to use similar technologies to push messages to 
              customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events. 
              But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online 
              culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing 
              onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once commercial</p>
            <p>promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction 
              between the Web and television fades. That's a prospect that horrifies 
              Net purists.</p>
            <p> 　　But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need 
              to resort to push strategies to make money. The examples of Virtual 
              Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a Web site selling 
              the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, 
              hospitality, and security will attract online customers. And the 
              cost of computing power continues to free fall,</p>
            <p>which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. 
              People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may well wonder why so 
              few companies took the online plunge.</p>

              Passage 3</p>
            <p> 　　An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the 
              classroom on the behalf of students' career prospects and those 
              arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of</p>
            <p>radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have 
              explored this distinction-in-deed, contradiction――which goes to 
              the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put comput-</p>
            <p>ers in the classroom.</p>
            <p> 　　An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of 
              job is a technical education, justified for reasons radically different 
              from why education is universally required by law. It is not simply 
              to raise everyone' s job prospects that all children are legally 
              required to attend school into their teens. Rather, we have a certain 
              conception of the American citizen, a character who is incomplete 
              if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness 
              are affected by things outside of himself. But this was not always 
              the case; before it was legally required for all children to attend 
              school until a certain age, It was widely accepted that some were 
              just not equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With 
              optimism characteristic of all industrialized countries , we came 
              to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computer-education 
              advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays 
              their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between 
              educational and vocational reasons for bringing computers into schools, 
              computer-ed advocates often emphasize the job prospects of graduates 
              over their educational achievement .</p>
            <p> 　　There are some good arguments for a technical education given 
              the right kind of student. Many European schools introduce the concept 
              of professional training early on in order to make sure children 
              are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It 
              is, however, presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many 
              jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants. 
              Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every 
              kind</p>
            <p>of professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy 
              is spread over so many states and involves so many international 
              corporations.</p>
            <p> 　　But, for a small group of students, professional training might 
              be the way to go since well-developed skills, all other factors 
              being equal , can be the difference between having a job and not.</p>
            <p>　　Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very 
              simple. It does not take a lifelong acquaintance to pick up various 
              software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer ,</p>
            <p>that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer 
              skills take――at the very longest-a couple of months to learn. In 
              any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host 
              of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. 
              It should be observed, of course, that no school, vocational or 
              not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.</p>
            <p>59. The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the 
              classroom is__</p>
            <p>[ A] far-reaching [ B] dubiously oriented [ C] self-contradictory 
              [ D] radically reformatory</p>

            <p>[A]is indicative of a pessimism in disguise</p>

            <p>61 . It could be inferred from the passage that in the author'

              Passage 4 </p>
            <p> 　　When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 
              3 months ago that it had cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton 
              moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this unusual 
              animal</p>
            <p>husbandry technique to clone humans , he ordered that federal funds 
              not be used for such an experiment although no one had proposed 
              to do so――and asked an independent panel of experts chaired by Prinoeton</p>
            <p>President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 
              days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. 
              That group――the National Bioethics Advisory Commission ( NBAC)-has 
              been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting 
              on 17 May, members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations.</p>
            <p> NBAC will ask that Clinton ' s 90-day ban on federal funds for 
              human cloning be extended indefinitely , and possibly that it be 
              made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the recommendation 
              narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the 
              cloning of human DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology. The 
              panel has not yet reached agreement on a crucial question, however, 
              whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for 
              private funding</p>
            <p>to be used for human cloning.</p>
            <p> 　　In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 
              17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested that the panel had found a broad 
              consensus that it would be &quot;morally unacceptable to attempt 
              to create a human child by adult nuclear cloning. &quot; Shapiro 
              explained during the meeting that the moral doubt stems mainly from 
              fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then 
              informally accepted several general conclusions , although some 
              details have not been settled.</p>
            <p> 　　NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government 
              funding for any attempt to clone body cell nuclei to create a child. 
              Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal funds 
              to create embryos ( the earliest stage of human offspring before 
              birth) for research or to knowingly endanger an embryo' s life, 
              NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.</p>
            <p> 　　NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately 
              funded researchers and clinics not to try to clone humans by body 
              cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go</p>
            <p>further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete 
              ban on human cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal 
              for such legislation , but in a phone interview, he said this issue 
              was still &quot;up in the air. &quot;</p>
            <p>63. We can learn from the first paragraph that__</p>
            <p>[A]federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans</p>
            <p>[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning</p>
            <p>[C]NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique</p>
            <p>[D]the White House has got the panel's recommendations on cloning</p>
            <p>64. The panel agreed on all of the following except that__</p>
            <p>[A]the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a 
              law</p>
            <p>[B]the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control</p>
            <p>[C]it is crimtnal to use private funding for human cloning</p>
            <p>[D]it would be against ethical values to clone a human being</p>
            <p>65 . NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because__</p>
            <p>[A]embryo research is just a current development of cloning</p>
            <p>[B]the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research</p>
            <p>[C]an embryo' s life will not be endangered in embryo research</p>
            <p>[D]the issue is expLicitly stated and settled in the law</p>
            <p>66. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that__</p>
            <p>[A]some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely</p>
            <p>[B]a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time</p>
            <p>[C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC' 
              s appeal</p>

              Passage 5</p>
            <p> 　　Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it 
              prepares than on the preparedness of the minds of the men who watch 
              the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity 
              through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places 
              for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton 
              for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion 
              of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn' t they 
              fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down toward the 
              earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been 
              asking himself about those lalger fruits of the heavens, the moon 
              and the planets.</p>
            <p> 　　How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple 
              falling up into the tree? Newton did because he was not trying to 
              predict anything. He was just wondering.His mind was ready for the</p>
            <p>unpredictable. Unpredictabllity is part of the essential nature 
              of research. If you don' t have unpredictable things, you don' t 
              have research. Scienltists tend to forget this when writing their 
              cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is 
              filled with examples of it.</p>
            <p> 　　In talking to some scienlists, particularly younger ones, you 
              might gather the impression that they find the &quot;scientific 
              melhod&quot; a substitute for imaginative thought . I've attended 
              research</p>
            <p>conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about 
              the advisability of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist 
              has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said &quot;the data are still</p>
            <p>inconclusive.&quot; &quot;We know that, &quot; the men from the 
              budget office have said, &quot;but what do you think? Is it worthwhile 
              going on? What do you think we might expect?&quot; The scientist 
              has been shocked at having even been asked to speculate.</p>
            <p> 　　What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become 
              the victim of his own writings. He has put forward unquestioned 
              claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but 
              has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. 
              If experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as 
              faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate , then 
              it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce 
              results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable 
              for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they 
              are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by 
              the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the 
              other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity 
              to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing 
              of his papers would appear to reflect , is management to be blamed 
              for discriminating against the &quot;odd balls among researchers 
              in favor of more conventional thinkers who &quot;work well with 
              the team. &quot;</p>

            <p> 71) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there 
              are historians,modern practice most closely conforms to one that 
              sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the significant 
              events of the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, 
              each generation of historians determines anew what is significant 
              for it in the past. In thls search the evidence found is always 
              incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial or partisan. 
              The irony of the historian' s craft is that its practitioners always 
              know that their efforts are but contributions to an unending process 
              .</p>
            <p> 72) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external 
              challenge to the validity of history as an intellectual discipline 
              and more from internal quarrels among historians themselves.</p>
            <p>While history once revered its affinity to literature and philosophy, 
              the emerging social sciences seemed to afford greater opportunities 
              for asking new questtons and providing rewarding approaches to an 
              understanding of the past. Social science methodologies had to be 
              adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical sources 
              rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 73) During 
              this transfer , traditional historical methods were augmented by 
              additional methodologies designed to interpret the new forms of 
              evidence in the historical study.</p>
            <p> Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the 
              historical profession. 74 ) There is no agreement whether methodology 
              refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in general or 
              to the research techniques appropriate to the various branches of 
              historical inquiry. Historians, especially those so blinded by their 
              research interests that they have been accused of &quot;tunnel method 
              , &quot; frequently fall victim to the &quot;technicist fallacy. 
              &quot; Also common in the natural sciences , the technicist fallacy 
              mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with certain parts 
              of its technical implementation. 75 ) It applies equally to traditional 
              historians who view history as only the external and intemal criticism 
              of sources, and to social science historians who equate their activity 
              with specific techniques.<br>

            <p>71．几乎每个历史学家对史学都有自己的界定，但现代史学家的实践最趋向于认为历史学是试图重现过去的重大史实并对其做出解释。</p>
            <p>72．人们之所以关注历史研究的方法论，主要是因为史学界内部意见不一，其次是因为外界并不认为历史是一门学问。</p>
            <p>73．在这种转变中，历史学家研究历史时，那些解释新史料的新方法充实了传统的历史研究方法。</p>
            <p>74．所谓方法论是指一般的历史研究中的特有概念，还是指历史探究中各个具体领域适用的研究手段，人们对此意见不一。</p>
            <p>75．这种谬误同样存在于历史传统派和历史社科派；前者认为历史就是史学界内部和外部人士对各种史料来源的评论，后者认为历史的研究是具体方法的研究</p>

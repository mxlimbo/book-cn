            <p> l</p>
            <p> A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph 
              of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, 
              I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my 
              men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something 
              has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. 
              It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is isappearing, 
              and I think I know what it is: accountability. Accountability isn' 
              t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for 
              his or her</p>
            <p>actions and liable for their consequences. Of the many values that 
              hold civilization together――honesty, kindness, and so on――account- 
              ability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can 
              be no respect, no trust, no law―― and, ultimately, no society.</p>
            <p> My job as a polioe officer is to impose accountability on people 
              who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But 
              as every policeman knows,external controls on people's behavior 
              are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame 
              and embarrassment.</p>
            <p> Fortunately there are still communities――smaller towns,usually――where 
              schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards 
              that proclaim: &quot;In this family certain things are not tolerated――they 
              simply are not done! &quot;</p>
            <p> Yet more and more, especially in our larger citis and suburbs, 
              these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. 
              He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, 
              including your life if you enrage him.</p>
            <p> The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. 
              Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed , society was considered 
              the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it' s the criminal who 
              is considered victimized : by his underpriviledged upbringing, by 
              the school that didn ' t teach him to read, by the church that failed 
              to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who</p>
            <p>didn' t provide a stable home. </p>
            <p> I don' t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances 
              choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, 
              even partly, from accountabiliy, we become a soci- ety of endless 
              excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything.</p>
            <p> We in America desperately need more people who believe that the 
              person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.</p>
            <p>31 . What the wise man said suggests that__.</p>
            <p>A. it' s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of 
              evil</p>
            <p>B. it' s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing 
              about it</p>
            <p>C. it's only natural for vinue to defeat evil</p>
            <p>D. it's desirable for good men to keep away from evil</p>
            <p>32. According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime,__.</p>
            <p>A. society is to be held responsible</p>
            <p>B. modern civilization is rnponsible for it</p>
            <p>C. the criminal himself should bear the blame</p>
            <p>D. the standards of living should be improved</p>
            <p>33. Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities 
              have__.</p>
            <p>A. less self-discipline B. better sense of discipline</p>
            <p>C. more mutual respect . D. less effective government</p>
            <p>34. The writer is sorry to have noticed that __.</p>
            <p>A. people in large cities tend to excuse criminals</p>
            <p>B. people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards</p>
            <p>C. today ' s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty</p>
            <p>D. people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal 
              activities</p>
            <p>35. The key point of the passage is that__.</p>
            <p>A. stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families</p>
            <p>B. more good examples should be set for people to follow</p>
            <p>C. more restrictions should be imposed on people' s behavior</p>
            <p>D. more people should accept the value of accountability</p>
            <p> 2</p>
            <p> The period of adolescence, i. e. , the person between childhood 
              and adulthood, may be long or short , depending on social expectations 
              and on society' s definition as to what constitutes matu- rity and 
              adulthood. In primitive societies adolescence is frequently a relatively 
              short period of time , while in industrial societies with pattems 
              of prolonged education coupled with laws against child labor, the 
              period of adolescence is much longer and may include most of the 
              second decade of one ' s life. Furthermore, the length of the adolescent 
              period and the definition of adulthood status may change in a given 
              society as social and economic conditions change. Examples of this 
              type of</p>
            <p>change are the disappearance of the frontier in the latter part 
              of the nineteenth century in the U-nited States , and more universally 
              , the industrialization of an agricultural society.</p>
            <p> In modern society,ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal 
              recognition and symbolic signifi- cance and there no longer is agreement 
              as to what constitutes initiation ceremonies. Social ones have been 
              replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased recognition 
              and social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school 
              graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and 
              while each step implies certain behavioral changes and social recognition 
              , the significance of each depends on the socio-economic status 
              and the educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for adolescence 
              have also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, right, 
              privileges and responsibilitis. It is during the nine years from 
              the twelfth birthday to the twenty-first that the protective and 
              restrictive aspects of child-hood and minor status are removed and 
              adult privileges and responsibilitis are granted. The twelve-year-old 
              is no longer considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, 
              airplane, theater and movie tickets. Basically, the individual at 
              this age loses childhood privileges without gaining significant 
              adult rights. At the age of sixteen the adolescent is granted cenain 
              adult rights which increases his social status by providing him 
              with more freedom and choices. He now can obtain a driver' s license; 
              he can leave public schools; and he can work without the restrictions 
              of child labor laws. At the age of eighteen the law provides adult 
              responsibilities as well as rights; the young man can now be a soldier, 
              but he also can marry without parental permission. At the age of 
              twen- ty-one the individual obtains his full legal rights as an 
              adult. He now can wote, he can buy liquor, he can enter into financial 
              contracts, and he is entitled to run for public office. No additional 
              basic rights are acquired as a function of age alter majority status 
              has been attained. None of these legal provisions determine at what 
              point adulthood has been reached but they do point to the prolonged 
              period of adolescence .</p>
            <p>36 . The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies 
              because__.</p>
            <p>A. the definition of maturity has changed</p>
            <p>B. the industrialized society is more developed</p>
            <p>C. more education is provided and laws against child labor are 
              made</p>
            <p>D. ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition 
              and symbolic significance</p>
            <p>37. Former social ceremonies that used to mark adolescence have 
              given place to__.</p>
            <p>A. graduations from schools and colleges B.social recognition</p>
            <p>C. socio-economic status D. certain behavioral changes</p>
            <p>38. No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until 
              he is __.</p>
            <p>A. eleven years old B. sixteen years old </p>
            <p>C. twenty-one years old D.between twelve and twenty-one years old</p>
            <p>39. Starting from 22,__.</p>
            <p>A. one will obtain more basic rights</p>
            <p>B. the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have</p>
            <p>C. one won't get more basic rights than when he is 21</p>
            <p>D. one will enjoy more rights granted bv society.</p>
            <p>40. Acoording to the passage, it is true that</p>
            <p>A. in the late 19th century in the United States the dividing line 
              between adolescence and adulthood no longer existed</p>
            <p>B. no one can marry without the permission of his parents until 
              the age of twenty-one</p>
            <p>C. one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a driver' 
              s license</p>
            <p>D. one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until 
              he can join the army</p>
            <p> 3</p>
            <p> Most growing plants contaln much more water than all other materials 
              combined. C. R.Darnes has suggested that it is as proper to term 
              the plant a water structure as to call a house com- posed mainly 
              of brick a brick building. Certain it is that all essential processes 
              of plant growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements 
              from the soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in 
              the soil solution before they can be taken into the root. They are 
              carried to all parts of the growing plant and are built into essential 
              plant materials while in a dissolved state. The car- bon dioxide 
              from the air may enter the leaf as a gas but is dissolved in water 
              in the leaf be-fore it is combined with a part of the water to form 
              simple sugars――the base material from which the plant body is mainly 
              built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 percent 
              water. Stnlctural parts of plants, such as woodv stems no longer 
              actively growing, may have much less</p>
            <p>water than growlng tissues.</p>
            <p> The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, 
              is only a very small part of what passes through it during its development. 
              The processes of photosynthesis, by which car- bon dioxide and water 
              are combined-in the presence of chlorophvll ( 叶绿素 ) and with energy 
              derived from light-to form sugars, require that carbon dioxide from 
              the air enter the plant. This</p>
            <p>occurs mainly in the leaves. The leaf surface is not solid but 
              contains great numbers of minuteopenings, through which the carbon 
              dioxide enters. The same structure that permits the one gas to enter 
              the leaf, however, permits another gas-water vapor――to be lost from 
              it. Since carbon dioxide is present in the air only in trace quantities 
              (3 to 4 parts in 1O ,000 parts of air) and water</p>
            <p>vapor is near saturation in the air spaces within the leaf (at 
              80&quot;F , saturated air would contain about 186 parts of water 
              vapor in 1O, OOO parts of air) , the total amount of water vapor 
              lost is many times the carbon dioxide intake. Actually, because 
              of wind and other factors, the loss of water In proportion to carbon 
              dioxide intake may be even greater than the relative concentrations</p>
            <p>of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon dioxide that enters 
              the leaf is synthesized into carbo-hydrates ( 碳水化合物) .<br>

              When television first began to expand, very few of the people who 
              had become famous as ra-dio commentators were able to be equally 
              effective on television. Some of the difficulties they ex- perienced 
              when they were trying to _46___ themselves to the new medium were 
              technical. When working _47_ radio, for example, they had become

            <p>This _49_ of seeing for others means that the commentator has to

              television screen._58_ his radio colleague,he must know the _59_

              V . Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
              underlined sentences into Chi-nse. (15 poinb)</p>
            <p> The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been officially 
              announced, has been with us for a long time now, and will be with 
              us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil flows freely or not, 
              it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to 
              depend on so fragile a base. (71) The supply of oil can be shut 
              off unexpectedly at any time, and in any case, the oil wells will 
              all run dry in thirty years or so at the present rate of use.</p>
            <p> (72) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, 
              but it is not likely to re-sult in any situation that will ever 
              restore that sense of cheap and plentiful energy we have had in 
              the times past. For an indefinite period from here on, mankind is 
              going to advance cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can 
              advance at all. To make the situation worse, there is as yet no 
              sign that any slowing of the world's popula- tion is in sight. Although 
              the birth-rate has dropped in some nations, including the United 
              States , the population of the world seems sure to pass six billion 
              and perhaps even seven billion as the twenty-first century opens. 
              (73) The food supply will not increase nearly enoueh to match this, 
              which means that we are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing 
              and marketing food. Taking all this into account , what might we 
              reasonably estimate supermarkets to be like in the year 2001? </p>
            <p>To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily 
              tighter over the next thirty years-even here in the United States. 
              By 2001 , the population of the United States will be at least two 
              hundred fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy million, 
              and the nation will find it difficult to expand food production 
              to fill the additional mouths. (74) This will be particularly true 
              since energy pinch will make it difficult to continue agriculture 
              in the high-energy American fashion that makes it possible to combine 
              few farmers with high yields.</p>
            <p> It seems almost certain that by 200l the United States will no 
              longer be a great food-export-ing nation and that , if necessity 
              forces exports, it will be at the price of belt-tightening at home.</p>
            <p> In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease 
              in variety, there is verylikely to be increasing use of flavouring 
              additives. (75 ) Until such time as mankind has the sense to lower 
              its pupulation to the point where the planet can provide a comfortable 
              support for all, people will have to accept more &quot;unnatural 
              food&quot; .<br>

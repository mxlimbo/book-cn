                <td> Passage 3 
                  <p>When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it 
                    is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, 
                    for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles 
                    may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they 
                    may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist poetry, 
                    however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist 
                    poetry may be even admitting that the theory on which it is 
                    based may be right, it can hardly be classed as Literature.</p>
                  <p>This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a noise and 
                    violence and speed. Consequently, our feelings, thoughts and 
                    emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding 
                    up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. 
                    We must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret 
                    modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential 
                    words, unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, of finite 
                    verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words 
                    that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different 
                    colored inks on the same page, and shorten or lengthen words 
                    at will.</p>
                  <p>Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But 
                    it is a little upsetting to read in the explanatory notes 
                    that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and 
                    a Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into 
                    the river and then to find that the line consists of the noise 
                    of their falling and the weights of the officers:` Pluff! 
                    Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.`</p>
                  <p>This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist 
                    poetry, can hardly be classed as Literature. All the same, 
                    no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: 
                    that a great change in our emotional life calls for a change 
                    of expression. The whole question is really this: have we 
                    essentially changed?</p>

                  <p>Passage 4</p>
                  <p>Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan 
                    whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the 
                    United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are 
                    seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten 
                    years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs 
                    as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely 
                    fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don`t know 
                    where they should go next.</p>
                  <p>The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of 
                    women into the male-dominated job market have limited the 
                    opportunities of teen-agers who are already questioning the 
                    heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan`s rigid 
                    social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, 
                    it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were 
                    fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent 
                    of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese 
                    workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did 
                    their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed.</p>
                  <p>While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the 
                    basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and 
                    mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression.&quot; 
                    Those things that do not show up in the test scores personality, 
                    ability, courage or humanity are completely ignored,&quot; 
                    says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic 
                    Party`s education committee.&quot; Frustration against this 
                    kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild.&quot; Last 
                    year Japan experienced2,125 incidents of school violence, 
                    including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many 
                    conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis 
                    on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then 
                    education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal 
                    reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities 
                    after World WarⅡhad weakened the &quot;Japanese morality of 
                    respect for parents.&quot;</p>
                  <p>But that may have more to do with Japanese life-stvles.&quot; 
                    In Japan,&quot; says educator Yoko Muro, &quot;it`s never 
                    a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but 
                    only how much you can endure.&quot; With economic growth has 
                    come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan`s 119 million 
                    citizens live in cities where community and the extended family 
                    have been abandoned in favor of isolated, two generation households. 
                    Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes(travels 
                    to and from work)and crowded living conditions, but as the 
                    old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning 
                    to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while 
                    still well below that of the United States, has increased 
                    by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly 
                    one-quarter.</p>

                  <p>［A］under aimless development</p>

                  <p>［B］Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning 
                    as well as creativity.</p>

                  <p>Passage 5</p>
                  <p>If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition 
                    health, distinction, control over one`s destiny must be deemed 
                    worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition`s behalf. If the 
                    tradition of ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely 
                    shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by people 
                    who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. 
                    In an odd way, However, it is the educated who have claimed 
                    to have give up on have give up on ambition as an ideal. What 
                    is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition-if 
                    not always their own the that of their parents and grandparents. 
                    There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing 
                    the barn door after the horses have escaped with the educated 
                    themselves riding on them.</p>
                  <p>Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and 
                    its signs now than formerly. Summer homes, European travel, 
                    BMWs. The locations, place names and name brands may change, 
                    but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade 
                    or two years ago. What has happened is that people cannot 
                    confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once 
                    they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and 
                    vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, 
                    which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic 
                    of American materialism with a Southampton summer home; the 
                    publisher of radical books who takes his meals in three-star 
                    restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy 
                    in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in 
                    private schools. For such people and many more perhaps not 
                    so exceptional, the proper formulation is,&quot; Succeed at 
                    all costs but avoid appearing ambitious.&quot;</p>
                  <p>The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; 
                    its public defenders are few and unimpressive, where the are 
                    not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition 
                    as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in 
                    the mind of the young, is probably lower than it has ever 
                    been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition 
                    is at an end, that people no longer feel its stirrings and 
                    promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is 
                    less openly underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way 
                    things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid 
                    supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest 
                    people trying to get on in life.</p>
                  <p>67.It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded 
                    if _____.</p>
                  <p>［A］its returns well compensate for the sacrifices</p>
                  <p>［B］it is rewarded with money, fame and power</p>

                  <p>68.The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably 
                    implies that it is____ .</p>
                  <p>［A］customary of the educated to discard ambition in words</p>
                  <p>［B］too late to check ambition once it has been let out</p>
                  <p>［C］dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the 
                    goal</p>
                  <p>［D］impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition</p>
                  <p>69.Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because____ 
                    .</p>
                  <p>［A］they think of it as immoral</p>
                  <p>［B］their pursuits are not fame or wealth</p>
                  <p>［C］ambition is not closely related to material benefits</p>
                  <p>［D］they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible</p>
                  <p>70.From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that 
                    ambition should be maintained_____ .</p>

                  <p>Part Ⅳ English-Chinese Translation</p>
                  <p>Directions:</p>
                  <p>Read the following passage carefully and then translate underlined 
                    sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly

                  <p>Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that 
                    the welfare of their people depends largely on the economic 
                    strength and wealth of the community.71)</p>
                  <p>Under modem conditions, this requires varying measures of 
                    centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists 
                    such as economists and operational research experts.72)Furthermore, 
                    it is obvious that the strength of a country`s economy is 
                    directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and 
                    industry, and that this in turn rests upon the efforts of 
                    scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that 
                    governments are increasingly compelled to interfere in these 
                    sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it 
                    is utilized to the best advantage. For example, the may encourage 
                    research in various ways, including the setting up of their 
                    own research centers; they may alter the structure of education, 
                    of in they may cooperate directly in the growing number of 
                    international projects related to science, economics and industry. 
                    In any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent 
                    on scientific advice and also scientific and technological 
                    manpower of all kinds.</p>
                  <p>73)Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, 
                    people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed 
                    to new customs and ideas, while governments are often forced 
                    to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given 
                    above. At the same time, the normal rate of social change 
                    throughout the world is taking place at a vastly accelerated 
                    speed compared with the past. For example.74)in the early 
                    industrialized countries of Europe the process of industrialization 
                    with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that 
                    followed-was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays 
                    a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade 
                    or so. All this has the effect of building up unusual pressures 
                    and tensions within the community and consequently presents 
                    serious problems for the governments concerned.75)Additional 
                    social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion 
                    or problems arising from mass migration movements-themselves 
                    made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport. 
                    As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming 
                    increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists 
                    for planning the appropriate programs and putting them into 
                    effect.</p>

                      作者：kaoyan.com网友silver<br><br>He ,perhaps some worldly-wise,but much more is simple like other rural boy. It's my luck to encounter him. He was the first boy that say to send me flowers on Lover Day. But I declined with thanks. Then it was not long before I heared that he had a girlfriend. I understand him.A lonely boy from countryside need to more care from others that can give him comfort. After all, it is not always agreeable to live with his relatives. we are still friends each other, with a tacit understanding. In fact, I am that person who only know what is his dislike, but not know what is his like forever. In my heart, he is my best friend . During my preparation for the entrance exam of postgraduate, he was always concerned with me. I know this by my sence though he had never say anything to express his care, I know. After review, he probably know something about me . He came to see me again .When I told him what had happened, He advised me sincerely. After a few word, he left. I recalled many things. I believe that he is my best friend forever in my heart wherever I am .But nothing is more than a common friend because I am my own.<br>

          <td>No.1 Opportunity and Success
            <p>Opportunities don't come often. They come every once in a while. 
              Very often, they come quietly and go by without being noticed. Therefore 
              ,it is advisable that you should value and treat them with care.When 
              an opportunity comes, it brings a promise but never realizes it 
              on its own. If you want to achieve something or intend to fulfill 
              one of your ambitious, you must work hard, make efforts and get 
              prepared. Otherwise, you will take no advantage of opportunities 
              when they come to visityou.The difference between a man who succeeds 
              and one who does not lies only in the way each treats opportunities. 
              The successful person always makes adequate preparations to meet 
              opportunities as they duly arrive. The unsuccessfulperson, on the 
              other hand, works little and just waits tosee them pass by.In my 
              opinion, there are plenty of opportunities for everyone in our society, 
              but only those who are prepared adequately and qualified highly 
              can make use of them to achieve their purpose.</p>
            <p>No.2 On Developing </p>
            <p>TourismTourism, a &quot;smokeless industry&quot;, is developing 
              rapidlyin China. With the open and reform policy being carried out, 
              thousands upon thousands of foreign visitors are crowding intoour 
              country. The are eager to see this old mysterious land with a splendid 
              culture of more than 5000 years.Tourism brings China a lot of benefits. 
              First it enables the Chinese people to know more about the outside 
              world and promotes friendship and mutual understanding. Second ,it 
              is financially beneficial to China, which needs more foreigncurrencies 
              for its modernization program.Tourism, however, gives rise to a 
              number of problems. For instance, it becomes a burden to our inefficient 
              transportation system. Besides, the living standard of the average 
              Chinese is still not high enough to be able to afford the many different 
              sorts of expenses during long distance travels. As for me, I believe 
              that with the development of our national economy, allthese problems 
              will certainly be solved step by step. A much better and brighter 
              future awaits us.</p>
            <p>No.3 The Value of Time</p>
            <p>As a popular saying goes, &quot;Time is money. &quot;In fact, time 
              is more precious than money. When money is spent, you can earn it 
              back if you want to. However, when time is gone, it will never come 
              back.As the pace of modern life continues to accelerate ,the time 
              at our disposal is quite limited. But there are a lot of things 
              to be done in our lives. We should make full use of our time to 
              fulfil what is useful to us. For instance, as students we should 
              devote most of our time to our academic studies. In this way we 
              can acquire new knowledge and skill necessary for our future carrier.In 
              my opinion, wasting time means wasting our valuable life. But many 
              of us don't realize this .They think time is inexhaustable. I'm 
              not in favor of such of a view .Hence ,my conclusion is that we 
              should never put off what can be today until tomorrow. ――</p>
            <p>No.4 Are Prizes a Good Thing?</p>
            <p>Nobody denies that competitions with prizes can bring people's 
              initiative into full play. Encouraged by a strong desire to win 
              a prize, one will go all out to seek his greatest success. Consequently, 
              the best achievements will be obtained in a game with awards.However, 
              the prompting of a prize does not always lead to desirable results. 
              For example, a competitor who cannot overcome the temptation of 
              a prize is likely to take a stimulant .And the hopeless competitor 
              sees nothing but the prize, which might cause improper behavior.I 
              my opinion, the remedy lies in moral education of competitors. This 
              will help them to understand the slogan: &quot;Friendship――first, 
              and competition――second. &quot;Then, prices will play a better part 
              in any contest. Generally speaking, I believethat prizes are a good 
              thing.</p>
            <p>No.5 On Keeping a Diary in English</p>
            <p>Keeping a diary in English is one of the effective ways to improve 
              our English writing ability. Compared with other forms of writing, 
              it is shorter and takes less time. It can help us to cultivate the 
              habit of thinking in English. If we persist in this practice, gradually 
              we'll learn how to express ourselves in English.</p>
            <p>In keeping a diary in English, we inevitably run up against a lot 
              of difficulties .In the first place, it often happens that we have 
              trouble finding appropriate words and phases to give expression 
              to our mind. Secondly , there are many idiomatic ways of saying 
              things in Chinese. And it is extremely hard for us to put them into 
              English properly. Certainly, there are some other roadblocks we 
              may come across in our keeping a diary in English.</p>
            <p>As far as I'm concerned, my suggestion is that we should always 
              have a notebook and a Chinese-English dictionary within easy reach. 
              Whenever something beats us, we can first put it down in our notebook 
              and then consult our dictionary. We can also turn to our English 
              teacher for help, if necessary. In short, I believe that it is of 
              great use to keep a diary in English for the development of our 
              writing skills. <br>
              No.6 On University Tuition System in China</p>
            <p>Tuition system has become one of the hottest topics in China since 
              it was put into effect. Different people have different opinions 
              on it.</p>
            <p>Some people think that there is no university in the world which 
              is open to students without tuition. As far as China is concerned, 
              it is a developing country with the largest population in the world. 
              The government is unable to allocate enough funds to pay for various 
              teaching facilities and many different kinds of expenses. One of 
              the ways to relieve the problem is for students to pay tuition. 
              The money raised in this way can be used to improve the conditions 
              for running schools.</p>
            <p>Others ,however, are opposed to the tuition system. They argue 
              that the living standard of the Chinese people ,especially of those 
              in the poor rural areas, is still low, compared with that in the 
              Western World. The university tuition will certainly add to the 
              already heavy burden of the parents, who live on their salaries 
              or wages. Moreover, tuition may become an obstacle to the development 
              of China's higher education. This is because it hinders some talented 
              people from entering the university just on account of their poverty.</p>
            <p>No.7 Film Is Giving Way to TV in X City</p>
            <p>A recent survey analyzed the change in number of film-goers and 
              TV watchers in X city. As is shown by the graph, there has been 
              a sharp decline in the number of film -goers during the period from 
              1988 to 1998.On the other hand ,the number of TV watchers has steadily 
              increased in the last decade, reaching 150,000 in 1998.Finally,it 
              is interesting to note that there were as many film-goers as TV 
              watchers in the year of 1994.</p>
            <p>There might be two reasons, I think, for the change .First, TV 
              is not only a convenient source of entertainment, but a comparatively 
              cheap one. There is no point in arranging transport. And one needn't 
              pay for expensive seats at the cinema. Second, TV makes it possible 
              for one to keep abreast of current events and the latest developments 
              in science and technology. As a consequence, most people prefer 
              to stay at home, watching TV, rather than go out to the cinema, 
              which wastes</p>
            <p>both time and money.</p>
            <p>personally, I believe there are still a lot of people who enjoy 
              watching films.</p>
            <p>They claim that the film is a fascinating form of art. Sitting 
              comfortably in the cinema , one can appreciate the latest movies 
              which will usually be shown on TV far</p>
            <p>later on. Therefore, I trust the number of film-goers will be on 
              the rise in the future.</p>
            <p>No.8 The Fight Against Crime</p>
            <p>Today the crime rate in some of our cities seems to be rising. 
              Many citizens complain about the thefts and robberies which take 
              place in their street blocks. Therefore ,more and more people are 
              appealing to the authorities to take strong measures to reduce the 
              crime rate. </p>
            <p>Faced with criminals ,different people have different attitudes 
              towards them. Some become so frightened that they tend to give up 
              fighting or to turn a blind eye to the criminals. Others, however, 
              are brave enough to fight the criminals even at the risk of their 
              own lives. In their eyes, responsibility is the most important of 
              all the values that hold honest people together. Without it there 
              can be no self-respect, no trust, no law――and, ultimately, no society. 
              There is no doubt that they set a good example for all of us to 
              follow.</p>
            <p>As far as I am concerned, my suggestions are as follows. In the 
              first place, every one of us should receive a law education. Secondly, 
              criminals must be punished severely. Finally ,it is urgent to set 
              up a foundation to reward those who fight criminals. In the way 
              we can stand up to any crime and smash it.</p>
            <p>No.9 Road Accidents</p>
            <p>In recent years the number of road accidents has been on the rise 
              in big cities. Whenever they happen, the people involved are either 
              injured or killed. They cause great losses both to the country and 
              to the victims' families. Therefore, it is </p>
            <p>urgent that we do something to reduce traffic accidents and make 
              our roads safe.</p>
            <p>There are several ways I think to cut down the accident rate. In 
              the first place, </p>
            <p>the government should take effective measures to improve road conditions. 
              For example, more funds ought to be invested in building new highways 
              and many of the old narrow streets in cities widened or reconstructed. 
              Secondly, local authorities should educate people in every possible 
              way to comply with traffic regulations. Finally pedestrians should 
              be very careful whenever crossing busy streets.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, the above mentioned ways are essential to avoid 
              traffic accidents. There is no doubt that the road will be safer 
              to all of us if everyone does his part.</p>
            <p>No.10 Stress in Modern Life</p>
            <p>As everyone knows, stress is a natural part of everyday life and 
              there is no way to avoid it. As the pace of modern life continues 
              to increase, we are always feeling on the go from morning till night. 
              And it is hard to slow down. Therefore, stress goes hand in hand 
              with the life in a competitive society.</p>
            <p>Different people, however, think of stress quite differently. Some 
              believe that stress is not the bad thing it is often supposed to 
              be. They are of the opinion that a certain amount of stress is vital 
              to provide motivation and give purpose to life. Others argue that 
              stress contributes to one's mental decline and hence endangers his 
              health. According to them, relaxation, the opposite of stress, is 
              essential for a healthy mind and body.</p>
            <p>Personally, I'm in favor of the former view. I think it is impossible 
              to avoid stress when one is entirely devoted to the career he pursues. 
              In my opinion, it is only when the stress gets out of control that 
              it can lead to poor performance and ill health.<br>
              No.11 Sharp Increase in World Population</p>
            <p>According to the figures given in the bar charts. it took from 
              the beginning of human life to the year 1830 for the population 
              of the earth to reach one billion. That represents a time span of 
              at least two million years. Then the world population increased 
              rapidly, adding up to two billion in 1930. The next billion was 
              added by 1960, only thirty years. From then on the global population 
              was on the rise, amounting to 4 billion in 1975,which is another 
              billion people in only 15 years. There are at least two reasons, 
              I think, for the sharp increase in world population. In the first 
              place, the birth rate is continuously climbing in many countries, 
              especially in developing countries. Generally speaking, people there 
              hold the opinion that children don't cost much and when they get 
              old enough to work they will bring in money and that when parents 
              are old, they will take care of them. Secondly, the death rate in 
              most developed countries declines steadily because people's standards 
              of living are raised and health care improves.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, the chief reason for the population growth is not 
              so much a rise in birth rates as a fall in death rates as a result 
              of improvements in medical care.</p>
            <p>No.12 Wealth and Happiness</p>
            <p>Wealth has always been what some people long for. It is true that 
              most of them try to acquire wealth by means of honest labor. Their 
              efforts contribute to the welfare of the society and at the same 
              time to the accumulation of their wealth,and hence to their happiness.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that wealth brings happiness, especially in the 
              modern society. Various kinds of up-to-date household appliances, 
              latest fashions and recreations make their appearance with each 
              passing day. All this makes our life more comfortable and colorful. 
              Therefore, without money we cannot turn admiration into reality.</p>
            <p>But there are exceptions when wealth does not go band in hand with 
              happiness. Wealth may tempt weak-willed persons to be addicted to 
              harmful habits, such as drug-taking and gambling, and result in 
              their own ruin. Also, a person may lose his reason and go astray 
              if he is entirely devoted to seeking wealth.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, on no account can we identify wealth with happiness. 
              I also believe that one should never rely only on wealth to achieve 
              happiness.</p>
            <p>No.13 Average Personal Income of the Chinese Farmers form 1970 
              to 1990</p>
            <p>According to the figures given by the graph, the Chinese farmers' 
              personal income rose steadily from 1970 to 1990. In the middle of 
              1970's their income was rather low. Their annual personal income 
              was about 140 yuan. But in 1980 the average personal income increased 
              approximately 50%,reaching 210 yuan. As is shown by the graph, in 
              1985 their income doubled, amounting to 420 yuan. After that there 
              was a consistent tendency for income to grow. In a word, during 
              the period of 20 years the farmers' income had gone up rapidly.</p>
            <p>There were two reasons for the increase in the farmers' income 
              in China. First, the Chinese government had been carrying out a 
              reform and open policy. A large number of country-run enterprises 
              had been set up(in the country) in the rural areas. Second, a significant 
              reform of agricultural policy had taken place in China. The Party's 
              policy had brought farmers' initiative into full play. As a result, 
              the agricultural output had been on the rise all the time. All these 
              factors resulted in the steady growth of farmers' income.</p>
            <p>I believe that with a series of agriculture policies being carried 
              out, there will </p>
            <p>be even more rapid development in China's agriculture. There is 
              no doubt that the farmers' living standard will be improved to a 
              great extent.</p>
            <p>No.14 The Importance of Confidence</p>
            <p>Whatever one does, one should do it with confidence. If one has 
              no confidence, there is little possibility that one can achieve 
              anything when faced with hardships. This truth seems to be self-evident. 
              In reality, however, we do see a lot of people who always complain 
              that they lack the ability to do something or that their difficulties 
              are too great to overcomes. For some, this might be true. But for 
              many others, this only shows that they have lost heart.</p>
            <p>Why do some people often feel frustrated even though they are capable 
              of doing something? I think there are two main reasons. First, these 
              people don't have a correct estimate of themselves. Second, there 
              is another possibility that they overestimates the difficulties.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, one night build up faith in oneself as long as a 
              right attitude towards his own abilities. We should neither underestimate 
              nor overestimate our abilities. As a proverb says, &quot;Where there 
              is a will, there is a way.&quot; With confidence we can certainly 
              cope with any task we are faced with.&quot;</p>
            <p>No.15 What Is Success?</p>
            <p>What is success? Different people hold different views on this 
              question. Some think that one is successful if he can make a great 
              deal of money. Others argue that success means holding an important 
              government post. Still others believe that whoever has got a high 
              academic title is successful. It is clear that there are quite different 
              opinions on success.</p>
            <p>In order to become successful, you should first of all be both 
              perseverant and hardworking. As you know, whatever you do, there 
              are slways two possible results: success and failure. When you fail, 
              you should never lose heart. On the contrary, you must build up 
              your confidence and work even harder. You should always keep in 
              mind that perserverance is the mother of success and industry is 
              the key to it. In addition, you should pay great attention to you 
              work mothod. It is necessary for you to sum up your experience constantly 
              and improve the efficiency of your work. Finally, it is important 
              for you to get along well with you co-workers, care for each other 
              and help each other. If you follow these principles, you will certainly 
              achieve remarkable success in the future.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, success means achieving brilliant results in one's 
              work, that is, making outstanding contributions to the development 
              of the country and bringing happiness to the people.</p>

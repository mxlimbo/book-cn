              Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehension<br>
              Passage I<br>
              　　The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, 
              market－oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what 
              shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for 
              those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen 
              , striving to make profits , produce these goods and services in 
              competition with other businessmen ; and the profit motive , operating 
              under competitive pressures , largely determines how these goods 
              and services are produced. Thus, in the American eoonomic system 
              it is the demand of individual consumers , coupled with the desire 
              of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals 
              to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be 
              produced and how resources are used to produce it.</p>
            <p> 　　An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism 
              by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. 
              In the American economy, this mechanism is provided bv a price system, 
              a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative 
              demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If 
              the product is in short supply relative to the demand , the price 
              will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. 
              If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in 
              reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered 
              by seller-producers, which in tum will lower the price and</p>
            <p>permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating 
              mechanism in the American economic system .</p>
            <p> 　　The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that 
              individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private propeny) 
              , and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural 
              resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. 
              In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces 
              not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain 
              rights, including the right to determine the price of a product 
              or to make a free contract with another private individual .</p>
            <p>51 . In Line 11 , Para 1 , &quot;the desire of individuals to maximize 
              their incomes&quot; means__.</p>
            <p>A. Americans are never satisfied with their incomes</p>
            <p>B. Americans tend to oventate their incomes</p>
            <p>C. Americans want to have their incomes increased</p>
            <p>D. Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes</p>
            <p>52. The first two &amp;ntences in the second paragraph tell us 
              that__.</p>
            <p>A. producers can satisfy the oonsumers by mechanized production</p>
            <p>B. consumers can express their demands through producers</p>
            <p>C. producers decide the prices of products</p>
            <p>D. supply and demand regulate prices</p>
            <p>53 . According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is 
              characterized by__.</p>
            <p>A. private property and rights concerned</p>
            <p>B. manpower and natural resources control</p>
            <p>C. ownership of productive resources</p>
            <p>D. free contracts and prices</p>
            <p>54. The passage is mainly about__.</p>
            <p>A. how American goods are produced</p>
            <p>B. how American consumers buy their goods</p>
            <p>C. how American economic system works</p>
            <p>D. how American businessmen make their profits<br>
              Passage 2</p>
            <p><br>
              　　One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued 
              credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, 
              restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, 
              and they make many banking services available as well. More and 
              more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it 
              possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether 
              or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the &quot;cashless 
              society&quot; is not on the horizon-it's already here.</p>
            <p> 　　While computers offer these conveniences to consumers , they 
              have many advantages for sellers too. Electronic cash registers 
              can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide 
              range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This 
              information allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods 
              by showing which items are being sold and how fast they are moving. 
              Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. 
              At the same time these computers reoord which hours are busiest 
              and which employees are the most efficient , allowing personnel 
              and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also identify 
              preferred customers for promotional canlpaigns. Computers are relied 
              on bv manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed nlarketing 
              reports can help to decide which products to emphasize now, which 
              to develop for the future , and which to drop. Computers keep track 
              of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production 
              process itself.</p>
            <p> 　　Numerous other commercial enterprises , from theaters to magazine 
              publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors , 
              bring better and more efficialt services to consumers through</p>
            <p>the use of computers.</p>

              Passage 3</p>
            <p><br>
              　　Exceptional children are different in some significant way from 
              others of the same age. For these children to develop to their full 
              adult potential , their education must be adapted to those differences.</p>
            <p> 　　Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find 
              ourselves describing their environnlent as well. While the leading 
              actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of the importance 
              of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both 
              the family and the society in which exceptional children live are 
              often the key to their growth and development.</p>
            <p>　　And it is in the public schools that we find the full expression 
              of society' s understanding——the knowledge, hopes, and fears that 
              are passed on to the next generation.</p>
            <p> 　　Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that 
              minor we can see the strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, 
              and the central values of the culture itself. The great</p>
            <p>interest in exceptional children shown in public education over 
              the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society 
              that all citizens , whatever their special conditions , deserve 
              the oppor-</p>
            <p>tunity to fully develop their capabllities.</p>
            <p> 　　&quot;All men are created equal. &quot; We've heard it many 
              times, but it still has important meaning for education in a democratic 
              society. Although the phrase was used by this country' s founders 
              to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted 
              to mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational 
              opportunity for all children-the right of each child to receive 
              help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that 
              capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have confirmed 
              the right of all children-disabled or not-to an appropriate education 
              , and have ordered that pubLic schools take the necessary steps 
              to provide that education. In response , schools are modifying their 
              programs , adapting instruction to children who are exceptional 
              , to those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.</p>
            <p>59. In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading 
              actor on the stage to show that</p>
            <p>A. the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their 
              famiLy and the society</p>
            <p>B. exceptional children are more influenced by their families than 
              nomlal children are</p>
            <p>C. exceptional children are the key interest of the family and 
              society</p>
            <p>D. the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of 
              the exceptional children</p>
            <p>60. The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern 
              in education is that__.</p>
            <p>A. they are expected to be leaders of the society</p>
            <p>B. they might become a burden of the society</p>
            <p>C. they should fully develop their potentials</p>
            <p>D. disabled children deserve special consideration</p>
            <p>61 . This passage mainly deals with__.</p>
            <p>A. the differences of children in their learning capabilities</p>
            <p>B. the definition of exceptional children in modern society</p>
            <p>C. the special educational programs for exceptional children</p>
            <p>D. the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children</p>
            <p>62 . From this passage we learn that the educational concern for 
              exceptional children ___.</p>
            <p>A. is now enjoying legal support</p>
            <p>B. disagrees with the tradition of the country</p>
            <p>C. was clearly stated by the country' s founders</p>
            <p>D. will exert great influence over court decisions<br>
              Passage 4<br>
              　　&quot;I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we'll 
              know in vast detail how cancer cells arise, &quot; says microbiologist 
              Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. &quot;But, &quot; he cautions, 
              &quot;some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, 
              the cure will rapidly follow.</p>
            <p>　　Consider Pasteur. He discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, 
              but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available. &quot;</p>
            <p> 　　This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from 
              cancer will survive at least five years. In the year 2000 , the 
              National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent.</p>
            <p>　　For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high 
              as 90 percent. But other survivaＬ statistics are still discouraging——13 
              percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pan-</p>
            <p>creas (胰腺) .</p>
            <p> 　　With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how 
              cancer works is not easy. The researchers made great progress in 
              the early 1970s, when they disoovered that oncogenes, which are 
              cancer-causing genes (基因) , are inactive in normal cells. Anything 
              from cosmic rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, 
              but how remains unknown. If several oncogenes are driven into action, 
              the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.</p>
            <p>　　The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood 
              that many cancers are initiated at the level of genes suggests that 
              we will never prevent all cancers. &quot;Changes are a nor-</p>
            <p>mal part of the evoLutionary process , &quot; says oncologist William 
              Haywar. Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as 
              Hayward points out , &quot;We can' t prepare a medicine against 
              cosmic</p>
            <p>rays. &quot;The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter.</p>
            <p>&quot;First , we need to understand how the normal cell controls 
              itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited 
              number of genes in cells which are always responsible for at least 
              part of the trouble. If we can understand how cancer works, we can 
              counteract its action. &quot;</p>
            <p>63. The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to__.</p>
            <p>A. predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade</p>
            <p>B. indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright</p>
            <p>C. prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years</p>
            <p>D. warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can 
              be conquered</p>
            <p>64. The author implies that bv the year 2000 ,__.</p>
            <p>A. there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate 
              of skin-cancer patients</p>
            <p>B. 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living</p>
            <p>C. the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with 
              various cancers</p>
            <p>D. there won' t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer 
              patients</p>
            <p>65 . Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes__.</p>
            <p>A. that are always in operation in a healthy person</p>
            <p>B. which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated</p>
            <p>C. that can be driven out of normal cells</p>
            <p>D. which normal cells can' t turn off</p>
            <p>66 . The word &quot;dormant&quot; in the third paragraph most probably 
              means__.</p>
            <p>A. dead B. ever-present C. inactive D. potential<br>
              Passage 5<br>
              　　Discoveries in science and technology are thought by &quot;untaught 
              minds&quot; to come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic 
              accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, 
              look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin 
              there and then.</p>
            <p>　　He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years 
              before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost 
              always come out of laborious trial and enor. Innovation is like 
              soc-</p>
            <p>cer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked 
              much more frequently than they score.</p>
            <p> 　　The point is that the players who score most are the ones who 
              take most shots at the and so it goes with innovation in any field 
              of activity. The prime difference between innovation and others 
              is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously 
              on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable 
              or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions 
              , professional innovators see as solid possibilities.</p>
            <p> 　　&quot;Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that 
              there' s no particular virtue in doing things the way they have 
              always been done, &quot; wrote Rudolph Flexh, a language authority, 
              this accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like 
              plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more 
              convenient : &quot;How come nobody thought of that before?&quot;</p>
            <p> 　　The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing 
              is as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only 
              one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average 
              person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparentLy 
              simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, 
              which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more 
              interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.</p>
            <p> 　　Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.</p>
            <p>67. What does the author probably mean by &quot;untaught mind&quot; 
              in the first paragraph?</p>
            <p>A. A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.</p>
            <p>B. A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.</p>
            <p>C. A person who has had no education.</p>
            <p>D. An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.</p>
            <p>68 . According to the author , what distinguishes innovators from 
              non-innovators?</p>
            <p>A. The variety of ideas they have.</p>
            <p>B. The intelligence they possess.</p>
            <p>C. The way they deal with problems.</p>
            <p>D. The way they present their findings.</p>
            <p>69. The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because__.</p>
            <p>A. Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human 
              creativity</p>
            <p>B. the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative individuals 
              look for new ways of doing things .</p>
            <p>C. the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch' s point of view</p>

              presented</p>
            <p>70. The phrase &quot;march to a different drummer&quot; (the last 
              line of the passage) suggests that highly creative individuals are__.</p>
            <p>A. diligent in pursuing their goals</p>
            <p>B. reluctant to follow common ways of doing things</p>

              Part Ⅳ English-Chinese Translation<br>
              　　According to the new school of scientists, technology is an overlooked 
              force in expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge. (71 ) Science 
              moves forward, they say, not so much through the</p>
            <p>insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things 
              like improved techniques and tools. (72) &quot;In short&quot; , 
              a leader of the new school contends, &quot;the scientific revolution, 
              as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use 
              of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in 
              innumerable directions. &quot;</p>
            <p> 　　(73 )Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source 
              of fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians 
              and philosophers of science. The modern school that hails technology 
              algues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, 
              and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and derived 
              great benefit from, craft information and technological devices 
              of different kinds that were usable in scientific experiments.</p>
            <p> 　　The centerhiece of the argument of a technology-yes , genius-no 
              advocate was an analysis of Gialileo' s role at the start of the 
              scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from</p>
            <p>Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system 
              of the sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (74) 
              Galileo' s greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person 
              to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that 
              the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. 
              But the real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, 
              was the long evolution in the improvement of machinery for making 
              eyeglasses .</p>
            <p> 　　Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. 
              genius dispute. (75)Whether the Govemment should increase the financing 
              of pure science at the expense of technology or vice ver-</p>
            <p>sa (反之) often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving 
              force.<br>

            <p>Passage 1 </p>
            <p> 　　It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. 
              After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary 
              debates, Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority 
              in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill 
              patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote 
              of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and 
              was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director 
              of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group's 
              on line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: &quot;We posted bulletins 
              all day long, because of course this isn't just something that happened 
              in Australia. It's world history.&quot; </p>
            <p> 　　The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of 
              the Terminally III law has left physicians and citizens alike trying 
              to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed 
              sighs of relief, others, including churches, right to life groups 
              and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill 
              and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. 
              In Australia - where an aging population, life extending technology 
              and changing community attitudes have all played their part - other 
              states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. 
              In the US and Canada, where the right to die movement is gathering 
              strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling. 
            </p>
            <p> 　　Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request 
              death - probably by a deadly injection or pill - to put an end to 
              suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two 
              doctors. After a &quot;cooling off&quot; period of seven days, the 
              patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish 
              for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54 year old Darwin resident 
              suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law 
              means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his 
              suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. &quot;I'm 
              not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was 
              afraid of was how I'd go, because I've watched people die in the 
              hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,&quot; he 
              says. <br>
              51. From the second paragraph we learn that _____ . </p>
            <p>A)the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries 
            </p>
            <p>B)physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia </p>
            <p>C)changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage 
              of the law </p>
            <p>D)it takes time to realize the significance of the law's passage 
              <br>
              52. When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes 
              to start falling, he means _____. </p>
            <p>A)observers are taking a wait and see attitude towards the future 
              of euthanasia </p>
            <p>B)similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other 
              countries </p>
            <p>C)observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes 
            </p>
            <p>D)the effecttaking process of the passed bill may finally come 
              to a stop <br>
              53. When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will _____. </p>
            <p>A)face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia </p>
            <p>B)experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient </p>
            <p>C)have an intense fear of terrible suffering </p>
            <p>D)undergo a cooling off period of seven days <br>
              54. The author's attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of 
              _____. </p>
            <p>A)opposition</p>
            <p>B)suspicion</p>

              Passage 2 </p>
            <p> 　　A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is 
              how friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. 
              To be　fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and 
              Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, 
              of course, exceptions. Small minded officials, rude waiters, and 
              illmannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US Yet it is 
              an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. </p>
            <p> 　　For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, 
              a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness 
              and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally 
              lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome 
              sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world. </p>
            <p> 　　The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition 
              of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or 
              ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. 
              It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable 
              impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness 
              of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care 
              of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, 
              you might be in the same situation. </p>
            <p> 　　Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize 
              in helping the weary traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality 
              to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller 
              cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. &quot;I was 
              just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty 
              soon he invited me home for dinner - amazing.&quot; Such observations 
              reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always 
              understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should 
              be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as 
              the result of a historically developed cultural tradition. </p>
            <p> 　　As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set 
              of cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all 
              social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does 
              not necessarily meant that someone understands social and cultural 
              patterns. Visitors who fail to &quot;translate&quot; cultural meanings 
              properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an American 
              uses the word &quot;friend&quot;, the cultural implications of the 
              word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor's language 
              and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish 
              between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being 
              friendly is a virtue that many American value highly and expect 
              from both neighbors and strangers. <br>
              55. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, _____. </p>
            <p>A)rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US </p>
            <p>B)small minded officials deserve a serious comment </p>
            <p>C)Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors </p>
            <p>D)most Americans are ready to offer help <br>
              56. It could be inferred from the last paragraph that _____. </p>
            <p>A)culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship 
            </p>
            <p>B)courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated 
            </p>
            <p>C)various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends 
            </p>
            <p>D)social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions 
              <br>
              57. Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers 
              _____. </p>
            <p>A)to improve their hard life</p>
            <p>B)in view of their long distance travel </p>
            <p>C)to add some flavor to their own daily life</p>
            <p>D)out of a charitable impulse <br>
              58. The tradition of hospitality to strangers _____. </p>
            <p>A)tends to be superficial and artificial </p>
            <p>B)is generally well kept up in the United States </p>
            <p>C)is always understood properly </p>
            <p>D)was something to do with the busy tourist trails <br>
              　<br>
              Passage 3 </p>
            <p> 　　Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily 
              or mental functioning is a drug. Many people mistakenly believe 
              the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal 
              chemical taken by drug addicts. They don't realize that familiar 
              substances such as alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why 
              the more neutral term substance is now used by many physicians and 
              psychologists. The phrase &quot;substance abuse&quot; is often used 
              instead of &quot;drug abuse&quot; to make clear that substances 
              such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as 
              heroin and cocaine. </p>
            <p> 　　We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances 
              (drugs) is pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine 
              to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a cigarette 
              for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently 
              constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most 
              substances taken in excess will produce negative effects such as 
              poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance 
              can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence 
              is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of 
              the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by 
              the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance 
              is discontinued. </p>
            <p> 　　Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and 
              alter perception, mood, and behavior are known as psychoactive substances. 
              Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped according to whether 
              they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially 
              speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants 
              slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, 
              distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including producing 
              hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic 
              (from the Greek word meaning &quot;mindmanifesting&quot;) because 
              they seemed to radically alter one's state of consciousness. <br>
              59. &quot;Substance abuse&quot; (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable 
              to &quot;drug abuse&quot; in that _____. </p>
            <p>A)substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally 
              used </p>
            <p>B)&quot;drug abuse&quot; is only related to a limited number of 
              drug takers </p>
            <p>C)alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine </p>
            <p>D)many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous 
              <br>
              60. The word &quot;pervasive&quot; (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean 
              _____. </p>
            <p>A)widespread</p>
            <p>B)overwhelming</p>
            <p>C)piercing</p>
            <p>D)fashionable <br>
              61. Physical dependence on certain substances results from _____. 
            </p>
            <p>A)uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time </p>
            <p>B)exclusive use of them for social purposes </p>
            <p>C)quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases 
            </p>
            <p>D)careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms <br>
              62. From the last paragraph we can infer that _____. </p>
            <p>A)stimulants function positively on the mind </p>
            <p>B)hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health </p>
            <p>C)depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances </p>
            <p>D)the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used

              　<br>
              Passage 4 </p>
            <p> 　　No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral 
              decline of a nation. &quot;Is this what you intended to accomplish 
              with your careers?&quot; Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives 
              last week. &quot;You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt 
              our nation and threaten our children as well?&quot; At Time Warner, 
              however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the 
              soul searching that has involved the company ever since the company 
              was born in 1990. It's a selfexamination that has, at various times, 
              involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate 
              bottom line. </p>
            <p> 　　At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who 
              took over for the late Steve Ross in 1992. On the financial front, 
              Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the 
              company's mountainous debt, which will increase to 17.3 billion 
              after two new cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some 
              of the property and restructure the company, but investors are waiting 
              impatiently. </p>
            <p> The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin 
              has consistently defended the company's rap music on the grounds 
              of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire for releasing 
              Ice T's violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful 
              expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. &quot;The 
              test of any democratic society,&quot; he wrote in a Wall Streel 
              Journal column, &quot;lies not in how well it can control expression 
              but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest 
              possible latitude, however disputable or irritating the results 
              may sometimes be. We won't retreat in the face of any threats.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> 　　Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were 
              signs that the chairman was backing off his hard line stand, at 
              least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing verses 
              at last month's stockholders' meeting, Levin asserted that &quot;music 
              is not the cause of society's ills&quot; and even cited his son, 
              a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to communicate with 
              students. But he talked as well about the &quot;balanced struggle&quot; 
              between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced 
              that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution 
              and labeling of potentially objectionable music. </p>
            <p> 　　The 15 member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin 
              and his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them have 
              shown their concerns in this matter. &quot;Some of us have known 
              for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment 
              are not totally unlimited,&quot; says Luce. &quot;I think it is 
              perhaps the case that some people associated with the company have 
              only recently come to realize this.&quot; <br>
              63. Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for _____. </p>
            <p>A)its raising of the corporate stock price </p>
            <p>B)its selfexamination of soul </p>
            <p>C)its neglect of social responsibility </p>
            <p>D)its emphasis on creative freedom <br>
              64. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? </p>
            <p>A)Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner. </p>
            <p>B)Gerald Levin is liable to compromise. </p>
            <p>C)Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate. </p>
            <p>D)Stever Ross is no longer alive <br>
              65. In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman _____. 
            </p>
            <p>A)stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression </p>
            <p>B)softened his tone and adopted some new policy </p>
            <p>C)changed his attitude and yielded to objection </p>
            <p>D)received more support from the 15member board <br>
              66. The best title for this passage could be _____. </p>
            <p>A)A Company under Fire</p>
            <p>B)A Debate on Moral Decline </p>
            <p>C)A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture</p>

              　<br>
              Passage 5 </p>
            <p> 　　Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such 
              as &quot;steering the economy to a soft landing&quot; or &quot;a 
              touch on the brakes&quot;, makes it sound like a precise science. 
              Nothing could be further from the truth. The link between interest 
              rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long, variable lags 
              before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the 
              analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a 
              car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear view mirror and 
              a faulty steering wheel. </p>
            <p> 　　Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have 
              had much to boast about of late. Average inflation in the big seven 
              industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its 
              lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. 
              This is a long way below the double digit rates which many countries 
              experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s. </p>
            <p> 　　It is also less than most forecasters had predicated. In late 
              1994 the panel of economists which The Economist polls each month 
              said that America's inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995. In 
              fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 
              3% for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running 
              half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end of last 
              year. 　　　This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, 
              inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and 
              America. </p>
            <p> 　　Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation 
              figures in Britain and the United States, since conventional measures 
              suggest that both economies, and especially America's, have little 
              productive slack. America's capacity utilization, for example, his 
              historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate 
              (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of the natural 
              rate of unemployment - the rate below which inflation has taken 
              off in the past. </p>
            <p> 　　Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation 
              is, unfortunately, a little defective. Some economists argue that 
              powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the old economic 
              models that were based upon the historical link between growth and 
              inflation. <br>

              the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be 
              written clearly on the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points). </p>
            <p> 　　Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually 
              put. It sounds like a useful, groundclearing way to start. 71) 
              Actually, it isn't, because it assumes that there is an agreed account 
              of human rights, which is something the world does not have. </p>
            <p> 　　On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that 
              animals have none. 72) Some philosophers argue that rights exist 
              only within a social contract, as part of an exchange of duties 
              and entitlements. Therefore, animals cannot have rights. The idea 
              of punishing a tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly 
              the same reason, so is the idea that tigers have rights. However, 
              this is only one account, and by no means an uncontested one. It 
              denies rights not only to animals but also to some people - for 
              instance to infants, the mentally incapable and future generations. 
              In addition, it is unclear what force a contract can have for people 
              who never consented to it, how do you reply to somebody who says 
              &quot;I don't like this contract&quot;? </p>
            <p> 　　The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, 
              arguing about the rights of animals is fruitless. 73) It leads the 
              discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites you to think that 
              animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend 
              to other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false 
              choice. Better to start with another, more fundamental, question: 
              is the way we treat animals a moral issue at all? </p>
            <p> 　　Many deny it. 74) Arguing from the view that humans are different 
              from animals in every relevant respect, extremists of this kind 
              think that animals lie outside the area of moral choice. Any regard 
              for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake - a sentimental 
              displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to other 
              humans. </p>
            <p> 　　This view which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent 
              to chopping wood, may seem bravely &quot;logical&quot;. In fact 
              it is simply shallow: the confused center is right to reject it. 
              The most elementary form of moral reasoning - the ethical equivalent 
              of learning to crawl - is to weigh others' interests against one's 
              own. This in turn requires sympathy and imagination: without there 
              is no capacity for moral thought. To see an animal in pain is enough, 
              for most, to engage sympathy. 75) When that happens, it is not a 
              mistake: it is mankind's instinct for moral reasoning in action, 
              an instinct that should be encouraged rather than laughed at. <br>

            <p> 　　We meet smokers everywhere: in the streets, on college campuses 
              and in shops. There are 5.8 billion people in the world, and the 
              smokers are about 1.1 billion, which makes up 20 percent of the 
              world's total population. </p>
            <p> 　　Smoking is very harmful. I think there are two main aspects 
              to the damage. First, smoking consumes a great deal of money. As 
              is shown in the pictorial graph, smiling wastes 200 billion dollars 
              each year in the world. Second, smoking does harm to the health 
              of smokers, and it is the main cause of lung cancer. About 3 million 
              people die because of the relevant diseases derived from smoking 
              every year. </p>
            <p> 　　Because more and more people are aware of the great harm of 
              smoking to humans, the amount of tobacco consumption is on the decrease. 
              From the following figures we can clearly see the tendency. The 
              total amount of world tobacco production added up to 14.364 billion 
              pounds in 1994, but it dropped to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. At 
              the same time, many countries call on people to give up smoking. 
              So it is certain that the number of smokers is to decrease. <br>
              样题 2 </p>
            <p>About Tobacco Consumption </p>
            <p> 　　From the above set of pictures, we can see that there were a 
              total of 14.364 billion pounds of tobacco produced in 1994 and 14.2 
              billion pounds in 1995. Because the amount of tobacco production 
              is falling yearly, it can be predicted that the tendency of tobacco 
              consumption would also be falling yearly. There are many reasons. 
              Firstly, smoking wastes money. Every year there are two hundred 
              billion dollars &quot;burnt&quot; in the cigarette &quot;fire&quot;. 
              Secondly, smoking would hardly do people any good and it can even 
              cause cancer. Every year there are three million people &quot;buried&quot; 
              in the cigarette &quot;tomb&quot;. </p>
            <p> Although tobacco consumption is falling, there are too many people 
              who smoke. The population in the world is 5.8 billion, but about 
              twenty percent of the population, that is to say 1.1 billion people, 
              smoke. So the situation is serious and the movement against smoking 
              is still a difficult task. </p>

            <p> 　　The total product of tobacco was 14.364 billion pounds in 1994. 
              In 1995 the total product of tobacco in the world decreased to 14.2 
              billion pounds. The population of the world is 5.8 billion. The 
              number of smokers is 1.1 billion, which is 20% of the population 
              in the world. Every year 200 billion dollars is wasted owing to 
              smoking and 3 million people die of smoking. </p>
            <p> 　　From the total product of tobacco in the world we can draw a 
              conclusion that the tendency of tobacco consumption is decreased. 
              I think that there are two reasons. One reason is that more and 
              more people realize that smoking is harmful for health and give 
              up smoking. The other one is that smoking is forbidden in the popular 
              area in more and more countries. The two reasons lead to the decreasing 
              tendency of tobacco consumption in the world. <br>
              样题 4</p>
            <p> 　　From the pictures, we first know that there are a lot of smoking 
              people in the world. The number of the whole population in the world 
              is 5.8 billion, and the number of smoking people is 1.1 billion. 
              So the percentage of smoking person is about 20. It is a large ratio. 
            </p>
            <p> Secondly we know from the pictures that tobacco gives us only 
              disaster. Each year it devours 200 billion dollars and deprives 
              3 million people of their lives. It is horrible. </p>
            <p> 　　Luckily nowadays more and more people begin to pay attention 
              to their health. Thus I think the tendency of tobacco consumption 
              will descend. From the pictures we also know that the output of 
              the tobacco is declining, from 14.364 billion pounds in 1994 to 
              14.2 billion pounds in 1995. </p>

            <p> 　　As shown in the pictures, we can see that the total tobacco 
              product is 14.364 billion pounds in 1994, while it is 14.2 billion 
              pounds in 1995. The whole population of earth is 5.8 billion, but 
              the human beings who keeps smoking is 1.1 billion, maintaining the 
              proportion of 20 percent. Owing to the cigarette, 200 billion dollars 
              were wasted, 3 million people die of smoking annually. </p>
            <p> 　　From the figure given in the chart, we can come to a conclusion 
              that the total tobacco consumption will decrease. There are reasons 
              for the dropping consumption. First, more and more people believe 
              smoking do harm to health, waste money. So a lot of people begin 
              to give up smoking. Second, forbidding smoking in public areas cause 
              people conscious that smoking is a bad habit. Therefor, I believe 
              more and more will give up smoking with the advancement of society.

            <p> 　　From the pictures, we can draw a conclusion that the tobacco 
              consumption in the world is rather high. </p>
            <p> 　　In 1994, the total product of tobacco is 14.364 billion pounds 
              and in 1995, is 14.2 billion pounds. There are a great number of 
              smokers in the world - the number of 1.1 billion. That is to say, 
              of the 5.8 billion people, 20 percent have the habit of smoking. 
            </p>
            <p> 　　For the sake of high tobacco consumption, 2000 billion dollars 
              are lost and 3000 thousand people lose their lives every year. </p>
            <p> 　　In my opinion, the consumption of tobacco will decrease as more 
              and more people have come to know the damage of the tobacco. This 
              can be found in the pictures. Smoking leads to many problems such 
              as lung cancer, economic loss and pollution of the air. </p>
            <p> 　　For abovementioned reasons. I believe the consumption of tobacco 
              will decrease and all the problem it causes will be solved. </p>

            <p> 　　Today, many countries product all kinds of tobacco. Almost every 
              shop has tobacco. In 1994, the tobacco consumption has get to 143.64 
              billion pounds. So much tobacco can be sell out every year. The 
              population of the world is 58 million. But, smokers in the world 
              have 11 million. It is about 20% of world population. </p>
            <p> 　　We all know, smoking has a great harm to people. Every year 
              about 300 million people died desease that deprive from smoking. 
              Smoking use much money every year. About 2000 million dollars. </p>
            <p> 　　We can see, smoking is so much harmness. So, we advocate all 
              of people have't smoke. </p>
            <p> 　　In 1995, the tobacco consumption has 142 million pounds, much 
              less that in 1994. Because many people of smoking already think 
              the smoking has no advantage, only bring illness. </p>
            <p> 　　We hope all of the world, it is no people smoke in the future.

            <p>On Smoking </p>
            <p> 　　In the whole world the tobacco consumption has being decrease. 
              According to the figure given in the data, we can see tobacco consumption 
              was about 143.64 billion pounds in 1994, and about 142 billion pounds 
              in 1995. Why are there on the decrease? </p>
            <p> 　　I think there are two reasons. In the first place, smoking is 
              do harm to people health. For example, it is may be responsible 
              for lung cancer. There are about 300 thousand people died of smoking 
              every year. Secondly, smoking cost a great deal. Every year money 
              spend on smoking is about 200000000. </p>
            <p> 　　As a result, when people realize this, they begin to give up 
              smoking. </p>
            <p> 　　But I must point out that smoker all over the world still account 
              for 20%, about 11000000. So we must educate people give up smoking.

            <p> 　　In wave of economic reform, more and more people have realize 
              the damage of smoking. It is obvious. Smoking has not any benefit 
              to man's health, but as is know to all, everything has two sides. 
              The taxs of tobacco are main resource of nation finasal. So the 
              government of all country have to permit the product of tobacco. 
              According to the figure, we can see the sum production of tobacco 
              very great, 143.64 billion pounds in 1994, 142 billion pounds in 
              1995. The number of smoking man is 20% during world population. 
              Smoking damages not only human's body but also waste lot of money. 
              For example, there are 2000 billion dollar spending in tobacco and 
              300 million people die in smoking. </p>
            <p> 　　I think the tendency of tobacco consumprion have be taken down.

              样题 12 </p>
            <p> 　　From the figures we can see smoking is harmful to people's health. 
              On one hand, it cause many diseases; on the other, it costs a lot 
              of money. But today people all over the world still smoke a lot. 
              Some people smoke out of habit. Others enjoy smoking, and find it 
              is good for their nerves when they are tired. And still others smoke 
              to be sociable: they like to offer fridns cigarette when talking 
              business with others. </p>
            <p> 　　But as we all know doctors have warned people that tobacco is 
              very dangerous to the smokers and may cause all kind of illness, 
              including the cancer of lung. Many deaths are caused every year. 
              And the government too are taking measures to prevent people from 
              smoking. </p>
            <p> As far as I am concerned. I think smoking is a great evil that 
              should be abolished. I think government should take stronger measures 
              to eventually ban tobacco all together. </p>

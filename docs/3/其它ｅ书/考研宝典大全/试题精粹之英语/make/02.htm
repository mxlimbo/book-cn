            <p>Directions:</p>
            <p>Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each 
              question there are four answers marked［A］，［B］［C］and［D］.Read the 
              passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. 
              Then mark your answer on ANSWER SHEET 1 by blackening the corresponding 
              letter in the brackets with a pencil.(40points)</p>
            <p>Passage 1</p>
            <p>A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, 
              but, if properly handled, it may become a driving force. When the 
              United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of 
              the Second World War, it had a market eight ties larger than any 
              competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. 
              Its scientists were the world`s best, its workers the most skilled. 
              America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans 
              and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.　</p>
            <p>It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other 
              countries grew richer. Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance 
              proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves 
              at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge 
              American industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or 
              vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was only 
              one American television maker left, Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith 
              was bought by South Korea`s LG Electronics in July.)Foreign-made 
              cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market America`s 
              machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as 
              though the making of semiconductors, which America had which sat 
              at the heart of the new computer age, was going to be the next casualty.</p>
            <p>All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking 
              prosperity for granted. They began to believe that their way of 
              doing business was failing, and that their incomes would therefore 
              shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry 
              after another into the causes of America`s industrial decline. Their 
              sometimes sensational findings were filled with warnings about the 
              growing competition from overseas.</p>
            <p>How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back 
              on five years of solid growth while Japan has been struggling. Few 
              Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a devalued 
              dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded 
              to blind pride.&quot; American industry has changed its structure, 
              has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted,&quot; according 
              to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard`s Kennedy School 
              of Government,&quot; It makes me proud to be an American just to 
              see how our businesses are improving their productivity, says Stephen 
              Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And 
              William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people 
              will look back on this period as&quot; a golden age of business 
              management in the United States.&quot;</p>
            <p>51.The U.S.achieved its predominance after World War Ⅱbecause_____ 
              .</p>
            <p>［A］it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal</p>
            <p>［B］its domestic market was eight times larger than before</p>
            <p>［C］the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors</p>
            <p>［D］the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus 
              to its economy</p>
            <p>　</p>
            <p>52.The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in the 1980s 
              is manifested in the fact that the American_____ .</p>
            <p>［A］TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market</p>
            <p>［B］semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises</p>
            <p>［C］machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions</p>
            <p>［D］auto industry had lost part of its domestic market</p>
            <p><br>
              53.What can be inferred from the passage?</p>
            <p>［A］It is human nature to shift between self-doubt and blind pried.</p>
            <p>［B］Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.</p>
            <p>［C］The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.</p>
            <p>［D］A long history of success may pave the way for further development.</p>
            <p>54.The author seems to believe the revival of the U.S. economy 
              in the 1990s can be attributed to the____ .</p>
            <p>［A］turning of the business cycle</p>
            <p>［B］restructuring of industry</p>
            <p>［C］improved business management</p>
            <p>［D］success in education</p>
            <p>　</p>
            <p><br>
              Passage 2</p>
            <p>Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males 
              born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance 
              at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as 
              many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is 
              being changed. Now, by babies survive almost as well as girls do. 
              This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess of 
              boys in those crucial years when the are searching for a mate. More 
              important, another chance for natural selection has been removed. 
              Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby(particularly a boy baby)surviving 
              depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant 
              almost certain death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since 
              much of the variation is due to genes one more agent of evolution 
              has gone.</p>
            <p>There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, 
              but have fewer children. Few people are as fertile as in the past. 
              Except in some religious communities, very few women has 15 children. 
              Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become 
              average. Most of us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, 
              differences between people and the opportunity for natural selection 
              to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is happening. 
              The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty 
              for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today 
              everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring means 
              that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class 
              India compared to the tribes.</p>
            <p>For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia 
              has arrived. Strangely, it has involved little physical change No 
              other species fills so many places in nature. But in the pass 100,000 
              years even the pass 100year our lives have been transformed but 
              our bodies have not. We did not evolve, because machines and society 
              did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of 
              evolution: they &quot;look at an organic being as average looks 
              at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension.&quot; 
              No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond comprehension 
              for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how 
              far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.</p>
            <p>55.What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first 
              paragraph?</p>
            <p>［A］A lack of mates.</p>
            <p>［B］A fierce competition.</p>
            <p>［C］A lower survival rate.</p>
            <p>［D］A defective gene.</p>
            <p>56.What does the example of India illustrate?</p>
            <p>［A］Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.</p>
            <p>［B］Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.</p>
            <p>［C］The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the 
              tribes.</p>
            <p>［D］India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.</p>
            <p>57.The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because____ 
              .</p>
            <p>［A］life has been improved by technological advance</p>
            <p>［B］the number of female babies has been declining</p>
            <p>［C］our species has reached the highest stage of evolution</p>
            <p>［D］the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing</p>
            <p>58.Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?</p>
            <p>［A］Sex Ration Changes in Human Evolution</p>
            <p>［B］Ways of Continuing Man`s Evolution</p>
            <p>［C］The Evolutionary Future of Nature</p>

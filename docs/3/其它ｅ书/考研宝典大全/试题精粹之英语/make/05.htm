              Ⅱ. Each of the passags below is fnllowed by some questions. For 
              each question four answers are given. Read the passage carefully 
              and choose the best answer to each of the questions.</p>
            <p>Put your choice in the ANSWER SIIEET. (30 points)</p>
            <p> 1</p>
            <p> It is all very well to blame traffic jams, the mst of petrol and 
              the quick pace of modem life, but manners on the roads are beaoming 
              horrible. Everybody knows that the nicest men become monsters behind 
              the wheel. It is aU vvy well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, 
              but to have one in the driver's seat is arnother matter altogether. 
              You might tolerate the odd road-hog, the rude and inconsiderate 
              driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is the exception 
              to the rule.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the situation calls for a 'Be Kind to Other Drivers' ampaign, 
              otherwise it may get com- pletely out of hand. Road politeness is 
              not only good manners, but good sense too. It takes the most cool-headed</p>
            <p>and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to revenge 
              when subjected to uncivilized be- havior. On the other hand, a little 
              politeness goes a long way towards relieving the tensions of motoring. 
              A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in response to an act 
              of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance 
              so necessary in modem tralfic conditions. But such acknowledgements 
              of politeness are all too rare today. Many drivers nowadays don't 
              even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it. However, 
              misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical examples are 
              the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a 
              side street at solne hazard to following traffic, when a few seconds 
              later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a child 
              across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that 
              may be unable to stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old 
              ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to. It 
              always a- mazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead 
              bodies of these grannies.</p>
            <p> A veteran driver, whose mallners are faultless, told me it would 
              help if motorists leamt to filter correctly into traffic streams 
              one at a time without causing the total blockages that give rise 
              to bad temper. Unfortunately, modern motorists can' t even learn 
              to drive, let alone master the subtler aspects of roadsmanship. 
              Years ago the experts warned us that the car-owrner-ship explo- 
              sion would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users. 
              It is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.</p>
            <p>31 . According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily 
              caused by<br>
              A. people' s attitude towards the road-hog</p>
            <p>B. the rhythm of modem life</p>
            <p>C. the behavior of the driver </p>
            <p>D. traffic conditions</p>
            <p>32. The sentence &quot;You might tolerate the odd road-hog . . 
              . the rule. &quot; (Para. I ) implies that</p>
            <p>A. our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists</p>
            <p>B. rude drivers can be met only occasionally</p>
            <p>C. the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog</p>
            <p>D. nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists</p>
            <p>33. By &quot;good sense&quot; , the writer means</p>
            <p>A. the driver' s ability to understand and react reasonably</p>
            <p>B. the driver' s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions</p>
            <p>C. the driver' s tolerance of nlde or even savage behavior</p>
            <p>D. the driver' s acknowledgement of politeness and regulations</p>
            <p>34. Experts have long pointed out that in the faoe of car-owner-ship 
              explosion,</p>
            <p>A. road users should make more sacrifice</p>
            <p>B. drlvers should be ready to yield to each other</p>
            <p>C. drivers should have more communication among themselves</p>
            <p>d. drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others</p>
            <p>35. In the writer's opinion,</p>
            <p>A. strict traffic regulations are badly needed </p>
            <p>B. drivers should apply road politeness properly </p>
            <p>C. rude drivers should be punished</p>
            <p>D. drivers should avoid traffic jams</p>
            <p> 2</p>
            <p> In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror——the 
              glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun's rays to 
              enter but prevents the heat from escaping. According to a weather 
              expert' s prediction, the annosphere will be 3C warmer in the year</p>
            <p>2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present 
              tate. If this warming up took place, the ice caps in the poles would 
              begin to melt, thus raising sea level several metres and severely 
              flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric emperature 
              would lead to great changes in the climate of the nonthern emisphere, 
              possibly resulting in an alteration of earth's chief food-growing 
              zones.<br>
              In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated 
              on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much 
              thicker ice sheet. But the weather experts are now paying more attention 
              to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a few degress of 
              warming, in other words, by a warming on the scale that will possibly 
              take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.</p>
            <p> Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are 
              already dispappearing. The evi- dence available suggests that a 
              warming has taken place. This fits the theory that carbon dioxide 
              warms the earth.</p>
            <p> However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, 
              where temperatures seem to be falling. Scientists conclude , therefore, 
              that up to now natural influences on the weather have exceeded those 
              caused by man. The question is: Which natural cause has most effect 
              on the weather?</p>
            <p> One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers 
              at one research station have studied the hot spots and &quot;cold&quot; 
              spots (that is, the relatively less hot spots) on the sun. As the 
              sun rotates, every 27. 5 days, it presents hotter or &quot;colder&quot; 
              faces to the earth, and different as- pects to different parts of 
              the earth. This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution 
              of the earth's atmospheric pressure, and consequently on wind circulation. 
              The sun is also variable over a long term: its heat output goes 
              up and down in cycles, the latest trend being downward. Scientists 
              are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-weather 
              interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years, 
              &quot;including the last Ice Age. The problem is that the models 
              are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and 
              it is not. One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to 
              assume a delay of thousands of years while the solar ef- fects overcome 
              the inenia (惯性) of the earth's climate. If this is right, the warming 
              effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a useful counter-balance 
              to the sun's diminishing heat .</p>
            <p>36. It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide 
              in the atmosphere would</p>
            <p>A. prevent the sun's rays from leeching the earth's surface </p>
            <p>B. mean a warming up in the Arctic</p>
            <p>C. account for great changes in the climate in the noHhem hemisphere</p>
            <p>D. raise the temperature of the earth' s surface</p>
            <p>37. The article was written to explain</p>
            <p>A. the greenhouse effect</p>
            <p>B. the solar effects on the earth</p>
            <p>C. the models of solar-weather interactions</p>
            <p>D. the causes affecting weather</p>
            <p>38. Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northem hemisphere, 
              temperatures there seem to be faILing. This is</p>
            <p>A. mainly because the levels of carbon dioxide are rising</p>
            <p>B. possibly because the ice caps in the poles are melting</p>
            <p>C. exclusively due to the effect of the inenia of the earth' s 
              climate</p>
            <p>D. partly due to variations in the output of solar energy</p>
            <p>39. On the basis of their models, scientists are of the opinion 
              that</p>
            <p>A. the climate of the world should be becoming cooler</p>
            <p>B. it will take thousands of years for the inertia of the earth's 
              climate to take effect</p>
            <p>C. the man-made warming effect helps to increase the solar effects</p>
            <p>D. the new Ice Age will be delayed by the greenhouse effect</p>
            <p>40. If the assumption about the delay of a new Ice Age is correct,</p>
            <p>A. the best way to overcome the cooling effect would be to bum 
              more fuels</p>
            <p>B. ice would soon cover the northern hemisphere</p>
            <p>C. the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could 
              warm up the earth even</p>
            <p>more quickly </p>
            <p>D. the greenhouse effect oould work to the advantage of the earth</p>
            <p> 3</p>
            <p> Some people believe that intemational sport creates goodwill between 
              the nations and that if countries play games together they will 
              leam to live together. Others say that the opposite is true :</p>
            <p>that intemational contests encourage false national pride and lead 
              to misunderstanding 8nd hatred. There is probably some truth in 
              both arguments, but in recent years the Olympic games have done 
              little to support the view that sports encourages intenational brotherhood. 
              Not only, was there the tragic incident involving the murder of 
              athletes, but the Games were also ruined by lesser inci- dents caused 
              incipally bv minor national contests. One country received its second-place 
              medals with visible indignation after the horkey ( 曲棍球 ) final. 
              There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the 
              losers objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced that 
              one of their goals should not have been disallowed and that their 
              opponents' victory was unfair. Their manager was in a rage when 
              he said : &quot;This wasn' t hockey. Hockey and the Intenational 
              Hockey Federatior are finished. &quot; The president of the Federation 
              said later that such behavior could result in the suspension of 
              the team for at least three years .</p>
            <p> The Anlerican basketball team announced that they would not yield 
              first place to Russia, af- ter a disputable end to their contest. 
              The game had ended in disturbance. It was thought at first that 
              the United States had won, by a single point, but it was announced 
              that there were three seconds still to play. A Russian player then 
              threw the ball from one end of the court to the other, and another 
              player popped it into the basket. It was the first time the USA 
              had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. An appeal jury debated 
              the matter for four and a half hours before an- nouncing that the 
              result would stand. The American players then voted not to receive 
              the silver</p>
            <p>medals . Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport 
              is played competitively rather than for the love of the game. The 
              suggestion that athletes should compete as individuals, or in non-national 
              teams , might be too much to hope for. But in the present organization 
              of the Olympics there is far too much that encourages aggressive 
              patriotism.</p>
            <p>41. According to the author, recent Olympic Games have__ </p>
            <p>A. created goodwill between the nations</p>
            <p>B. bred only false national pride</p>
            <p>C. barely showed any intemational friendship</p>
            <p>D. led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred</p>
            <p>42. What did the manager mean by saying, &quot; . . . Hockey and 
              the International Hockey Federa-</p>
            <p>tion are finished&quot; ?</p>
            <p>A. His team would no longer take part in international games.</p>
            <p>B. Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair decisions.</p>
            <p>C. There should be no more hockey matches organized by the Federation.</p>
            <p>D. The Federation should be dissolved.</p>
            <p>43. The basketball example implied that</p>
            <p>A. too much patriotism was displayed in the incident</p>
            <p>B. the announcement to prolong the match was wrong</p>
            <p>C. the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision</p>
            <p>D. the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals</p>
            <p>44 . The author gives the two examples in paragraphs 2 and 3 to 
              show</p>
            <p>A. how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in international 
              games</p>
            <p>B. that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be</p>
            <p>C. that competitiveness in the games discourages intenrational 
              friendship</p>
            <p>D. that unfair decisions are common in Olympic Games</p>
            <p>45. What conclusion can be drawn from the passage?</p>
            <p>A. The organization of the Olympic Games must be improved.</p>
            <p>B. Athletes should oompete as individuak in the Olympic Games.</p>

            <p> Intelligence' at best is an assumptive construct-the meaning of 
              the word has never been clear. (71 ) There is more agreement on 
              the kinds of behavior refeued to by the term than there is on how 
              to interpret or classify them. But it is generally agreed that a 
              person of high intelligence is　one who can grasp ideas readily, 
              make distinctions, reason logically, and make use of verbal and 
              mathematical symbols in solving problems. Art intelligence test 
              is a rough measure of a child's capacity for learning, particularly 
              for learning the kinds of things required in school. It does not 
              measure character, social adjustment, physical endurance, manual 
              skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to-it was not 
              designed for such purposes. (72) To criticise it for such failure 
              is roughly comparable to criticising a thermometer for not measuring 
              wind velocity .</p>
            <p> The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the 
              intelligence of any subject is essentially a comparative affair.</p>
            <p> (73) Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative 
              matter we must be sure that the scale with which we are comparing 
              our subjects provides a 'valid' or 'fair' comparison. It is here 
              that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test 
              performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one's 
              best, the knowledge required for understanding what you have to 
              do, and the intellectual ability to do it. (74) The first two must 
              be equal for all who are being compared , if any comparison in terms 
              of intelligence is to be made. In school populations in our culture 
              these assumptions can be made fair and reasonable , and the value 
              of intelligence testing has been proved thoroughly. Its value lies, 
              of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis for prediction. 
              No one is in the least interested in the marks a little child gets 
              on his test; what we are interested in is whether we can conclude 
              from his mark on the test that the child win do better or worse 
              than other children of his age at tasks which we think require 'general 
              intelligence' .</p>
            <p> (75) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain 
              degree of confidence, but only if the child can be assumed to have 
              had the same attitude towards the test as the other with whom he 
              is being compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant 
              information which they possessed .<br>

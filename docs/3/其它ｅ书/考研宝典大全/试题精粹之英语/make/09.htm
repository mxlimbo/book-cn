              Passage l</p>
            <p> Tight-lipped elders used to say, &quot;It's not what you want 
              in this world, but what you get. &quot;Psych- ology teaches that 
              you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the 
              right things.</p>
            <p> You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make 
              a blueprint of a house, and each of us is continually making these 
              blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we intend 
              to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, 
              decide which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential 
              for any type of meal to be served.</p>
            <p> Likewise, If you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and 
              write a brief account of yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, 
              begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to 
              offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.</p>
            <p> This acoount of yourself is actuaLly a sketch of your working 
              life and should include alucation, experience and references. Such 
              an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard 
              application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews.While 
              talking to you,your could-be employer is deciding whether your &quot;wares&quot; 
              and abilities must be displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected 
              manner.</p>
            <p> When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities 
              and desires, you have something tangible to sell. Then you are ready 
              to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your could-be 
              job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the 
              firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgement. 
              Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the employment you 
              wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now.</p>
            <p>51. What do the elders mean when they say, &quot;It's not what 
              yau want in this world, but what</p>
            <p>you get. &quot;?</p>
            <p>(A) You'll certainly get what you want.</p>
            <p>(B) It's no use dreaming.</p>
            <p>(C) You should be dissatisfied with what you have.</p>
            <p>(D) It's essential to set a goal for yourself.</p>
            <p>52. A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used 
              in this passage as__.</p>
            <p>(A) an illustration of how to write an application for a job</p>
            <p>(B) an indication of how to secure a good job</p>
            <p>(C) a guideline for job description</p>
            <p>(D) a principle for job evaluation</p>
            <p>53. According to the passage, one must write an account of himself 
              before starting to find a job</p>
            <p>because __.</p>
            <p>(A) that is the first step to please the employer</p>
            <p>(B) that is the requirement of the employer</p>
            <p>(C) it enables him to know when to sell his services</p>
            <p>(D) it forces him to become clearly aware of himself</p>
            <p>54. When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities 
              and desires, you have some-</p>
            <p>thing__.</p>
            <p>(A) definite to offer (B) imaginary to provide</p>
            <p>(C) practical to supply (D) desirable to present<br>
              Passage 2</p>
            <p> With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers 
              in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation's news coverage, 
              as well as listen to it. And of course in Britain listeners and 
              viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national 
              radio services and dozens of local radio station. They are brought 
              sport , comedy, drama, music, news and current affairs , education 
              , religion , parliamentary coverage, children ' s pragrammes and 
              films for an annual licence fee of 83 pounds per household.</p>
            <p> It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years――yet 
              the BBC' s future is now in doubt. The Corporation will survive 
              as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the 
              time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the 
              subject of a nation-wide debate in Britain.</p>
            <p> The debate was launched by the Government , which invited anyone 
              with an opinion of the</p>
            <p>BBC-including ordinary listeners and viewers――to say what was good 
              or bad about the Corporation, and even whether they thought it was 
              worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC' s royal 
              charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the 
              organization as it is,or to make changes.</p>
            <p> Defenders of the Corporation-of whom there are many――are fond 
              of quoting the American slogan &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix 
              it. &quot; The BBC &quot;ain' t broke&quot; ,they say, by which 
              they mean it is not broken (as distinct from the word 'broke' , 
              meaning having no money) , so why bother to change it?</p>
            <p> Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world 
              around it is changing. The</p>
            <p>commercial TV channels――TV and Channel 4-were required by the 
              Thatcher Government's Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, 
              competing with each other for advertisers, and cutting costs and 
              jobs. But it is the anival of new satellite channels――funded partly 
              by advertising and partly by viewers' subscriptions-which will bring 
              about the biggest changes in the long term .</p>
            <p>55 . The world famous BBC now faces__ .</p>
            <p>(A) the problem of new coverage (B) an uncertain prospect</p>
            <p>( C) inquiries by the general public (D) shrinkage of audience</p>
            <p>56. In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is not 
              mentioned as the key issue?</p>
            <p>(A) Extension of its TV service to Far East.</p>
            <p>(B) Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.</p>
            <p>(C) Potentials for further intemational co-operations.</p>

            <p>57. The BBC's &quot;royal charter&quot; (Llne 4, Paragraph 3) stands 
              for__</p>
            <p>(A) the financial support from the roval family (B) the privileges 
              granted by the Queen</p>
            <p>(C) a contract with the Queen (D) a unique relationship with the 
              royal family</p>
            <p>58. The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no 
              other than__</p>
            <p>(A) the emergence of commercial TV channels</p>
            <p>(B) the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government</p>
            <p>(C) the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs</p>
            <p>(D) the challenge of new satellite channels<br>
              Passage 3</p>
            <p> In the last half of the nineteenth century &quot;capital&quot; 
              and &quot;labour&quot; were enlarging and perfecting their rival 
              organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by 
              a limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. 
              The change met the technical requirements of the new age by engaging 
              a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency 
              that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second 
              and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover 
              a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism and 
              municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though 
              still private business managed for the benefit of shareholders, 
              were very unlike old family business. At the same time the great 
              municipalities went into business to supply lighting , trams and 
              other services to the taxpayers .</p>
            <p> The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business 
              had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation 
              of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance 
              of shareholders as a class , an element in national life representing 
              irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the 
              landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management 
              of business. All through the nineteenth century, America,Africa, 
              India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British 
              capital, and British shareholders were thus enriched by the world 
              ' s movement towards industrialisation. Towns like Bournemouth and 
              Eastboume sprang up to house large. &quot; comfonable&quot; classes 
              who had retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the 
              rest of the community except that of drawing dividends and occasionally 
              attending a shareholders' meeting to dictate their orders to the 
              management. On the other hand &quot;shareholding&quot; meant leisure 
              and freedom which was used by many of</p>
            <p>the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilisation.</p>
            <p> The &quot;shareholders&quot; as such had no knowledge of the lives, 
              thoughts or needs of the workmen employed by the company in which 
              he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital and 
              labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was 
              in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even 
              he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which 
              the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of 
              the old family business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of 
              operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered such personal 
              relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power 
              and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, 
              enabLed the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the companies 
              who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and lockout 
              taught the two parties to respect each other' s strength and understand 
              the value of fair negotiation .</p>
            <p>59. It's true of the old family finns that__.</p>
            <p>(A) they were spoiled by the younger generations</p>
            <p>(B) they failed for lack of individual initiative</p>

              Passage 4</p>
            <p> What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early 
              America-breakthroughs such as the telegraph , the steamboat and 
              the weaving machine?</p>
            <p> Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country 
              ' s excellent elementary schools; a labor force that welcomed the 
              new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors ; and 
              above all the American genius for nonverbal , &quot;spatial&quot;thinking 
              about things technological .</p>
            <p> Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools 
              our early mechanics ,especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic 
              states, were generally literate and at home in arithmetic and in 
              some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.</p>
            <p> Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and invelltiveness 
              to this educational</p>
            <p>advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 
              1853 reported, &quot;With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, 
              the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled workman. &quot;</p>
            <p> A further stimulus to invention came from the &quot;premium&quot; 
              system, which preceded our patent system and for years ran parallel 
              with it. &quot;fhis approach,originated abroad, offered inventors 
              medals, cash prizes and other incentives.</p>
            <p> In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were 
              awarded at country fairs and at the industrial fairs in major cities. 
              Americans flocked to thess fairs to admire the new machines and 
              thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.</p>
            <p> Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the 
              American worker took readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinklng 
              required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson has pointed 
              out , &quot;A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced 
              to unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind 
              by a visual, nonverbal process . . . The designer and the inventor 
              . . . are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices 
              that as yet do not exist. &quot;</p>
            <p> This nonverbal &quot;spatial&quot; thinking can be just as creative 
              as painting and writing. Robert Fulton once wrote, &quot;The mechanic 
              should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc. ,like 
              a poet among the letters of the alphabet , considering them as an 
              exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits 
              a new idea. &quot;</p>
            <p> When all these shaping forces――schools, open attitudes, the premium 
              system, a genius for spatial thinking――interacted with one another 
              on the rich U. S. mainland, they produced that American characteristic 
              , emulation . Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier 
              times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and 
              excellence.</p>
            <p>63. According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions 
              in early America was in a</p>
            <p>large part due to__</p>
            <p>(A) elemental'y schools ( B) enthusiastic workers</p>
            <p>(C) the attractive premium system (D) a special way of thinking</p>
            <p>64 . It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early 
              American mechanics__</p>
            <p>(A) benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge </p>
            <p>(B) shed light on disciplined school management</p>
            <p>(C) was brought about by privileged home training</p>
            <p>(D) owed a lot to the technological development</p>
            <p>65 . A technologist can be compared to an artist because __</p>
            <p>(A) they are both winners of awards</p>
            <p>(B) they are both experts in spatial thinking</p>
            <p>(C) they both abandon verbal description</p>
            <p>(D) they both use various instruments</p>
            <p>66. The best title for this passage might be__</p>
            <p>(A) Inventive Mind (B) Effective Schooling</p>
            <p>(B) Ways of Thinking (D) Outpouring of Inventions<br>
              Passage 5</p>
            <p> Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution 
              are in the publisher ' s pipelines. A few have already appeared. 
              The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often 
              unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific 
              theories for the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology 
              , geology , and biology have provided a consistent , unified, and 
              constantly improving account of what happened. &quot;Scientific&quot; 
              creationism, which is being pushed by some for &quot;equal time&quot; 
              in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of evolution 
              are eivel, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists 
              and the majority of nonfundamentalist religious leaders have come 
              to regard &quot;scientific&quot; creationism as bad science and 
              bad religion.</p>
            <p> The first four chapters of Kitcher's book give a very brief introduction 
              to evolution. At ap- propriate places, he introduces the criticisms 
              of the creationists and provides answers. In the last</p>
            <p>three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists 
              a good beating. He describes their programmes and tactics, and, 
              for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of 
              their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. 
              When their basic motivation is religious, one might have expected 
              more Christian behavior.</p>
            <p> Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the 
              clarity and effectiveness of his arguments. The non-specialist wiU 
              be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and　argument 
              that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the reationists 
              will be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine 
              book, Stephen Jay Gould says: &quot;This book stands for</p>
            <p>reason itself. &quot;And so it does-and all would be well were 
              reason the only judge in the creation- ism/evolution debate .</p>
            <p>67. &quot;Creationism&quot; in the passage refers to__</p>
            <p>(A) evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe</p>
            <p>(B) a notion of the creation of religion</p>
            <p>(C) the scientific explanation of the earth formation</p>
            <p>(D) the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe</p>
            <p>68. Kitcher's book is intended to __.</p>
            <p>(A) recommend the views of the evolutionists</p>
            <p>(B) expose the true features of creationists</p>
            <p>(C) curse bitterly at this opponents</p>
            <p>(D) launch a surprise attack on creationists</p>
            <p>69 From the passage we can infer that__</p>
            <p>(A) reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate</p>
            <p>(B) creationists do not base their argument on reasoning</p>
            <p>(C) evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists</p>
            <p>(D) creationism is supported by scientific findings</p>
            <p>70. This passage appears to be a digest of__</p>
            <p>(A) a book review (B) a scientific paper</p>

            <p> The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific 
              research have several causes.</p>
            <p>71 )Some of these causes are completely reasonable results of social 
              needs. Others are reasonable consequences of particular advances 
              in science being to some extent self-accelerating. Some , how- ever 
              , are less reasonable processes of different growth in which reconception 
              of the form scientif- ic theory ought to take, by persons in authority, 
              act to alter the growth pattern of different areas.</p>
            <p>This is a new problem probably not yet unavoidable; but it is a 
              frightening trend. 72)This trend began during the Second World War, 
              when several govemments came to the conclusion that the specific 
              demands that a government wants to make of its scientific stablishment 
              cannot generally be foreseen in detail. It can be predicted, however, 
              that from time to time questions will arise</p>
            <p>which will require specific scientific answers. It is therefore 
              generally valuable to treat the scien- tific establishment as a 
              resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 73)This seems 
              mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of research 
              not related to immediate goals but of possible consequence in the 
              future. This kind of support , like all government support , requires 
              decisions about the appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based 
              on utility as opposed to lack of utility are straightforward. But</p>
            <p>a decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is 
              more difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable 
              one of supporting &quot;good &quot; as opposed to &quot;bad&quot; 
              science, but a valid determination is difficult to make. Generally, 
              the idea of good science tends to become con- fused with the capacity 
              of the field in question to generate an elegant theory. 74)However, 
              the world is so made that elegant systems are in principle unable 
              to deal with some of the world's more fascinating and delightful 
              aspects. 75) New forms of thought as well as new subjects for thought 
              must arise in the future as they have in the past, giving rise to 
              new standards of elegance.<br>

            <p>GOOD HEALTH</p>
            <p>. . . Wherever you are and whatever you do, staying healthy is 
              always important. With the improvement of our living standards, 
              people are attaching more and more importance to their health. We 
              students can' t keep the high study efficiency without good. health. 
              The same thing is true with workers, scientists and doctors. </p>
            <p>In my opinion, good diet and exercises are two major ways to keep 
              healthy. The food we eat every day must be rational and should include 
              meat, vegetables, eggs, and fruit. It is important to drink water 
              every day and not to get addicted to drinking coffee or some other 
              soft drinks. Ex-ercising every day is also essential for us to stay 
              healthy. We can ride bicycles, play tennis or swim. Of course we 
              don' t need to exhaust ourselves. We should plan our physical exercises 
              according to our actual condition. An hour a day is enough.</p>
            <p>As a university student, I have much free time to do exercises. 
              l usually play badminton and tennis. But sometimes I am lazy and 
              do not exercise for all kinds of excuses, such as cold weather and 
              exams. I must correct it. I am also careful with my diet. In a way, 
              keeping healthy is not very hard, if you just take it seriously.</p>

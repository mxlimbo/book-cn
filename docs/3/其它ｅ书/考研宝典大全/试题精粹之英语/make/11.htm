            <p> 　　Until recently most histroians spoke very critically of the 
              Industrial Revolution. They 41 that in the long run industrialization 
              greatly raised the standard of living for the 42 man. But they insisted 
              that its 43 results during the period from 1750 to 1850 were widespread 
              poverty and misery for the 44 of the English population. 45 contrast, 
              they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750, when 
              England was still a 46 agricultural country, a period of great abundance 
              and prosperity.</p>
            <p> 　　This view, 47 ,is generally thought to be wrong. Specialists 
              48 history and economics, have 49 two things:that the period from 
              1650 to 1750 was 50 by great poverty, and that industrialization 
              certainly did not worsen and may have actually improved the conditions 
              for the majority of the populace. <br>

            <p>Passage 1 </p>
            <p> 　　Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like 
              giant dams. Perhaps it is humankind's long suffering at the mercy 
              of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing the waters 
              to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, 
              sometimes, to be blind. Several giant dam projects threaten to do 
              more harm than good.</p>
            <p> 　　The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It 
              doesn't help that building a big, powerful dam has become a symbol 
              of achievement for nations and people striving to assert themselves. 
              Egypt's leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High 
              Dam. Turkey's bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk 
              Dam.</p>
            <p> 　　But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for 
              example stopped the Nile flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile 
              silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir of disease 
              which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.</p>
            <p> 　　And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, 
              in the heart of civilized Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped 
              just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam 
              on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual 
              problems of big dams. But Slovakia is bidding for independence from 
              the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.</p>
            <p> 　　Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to 
              the even more wrong headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this 
              even though its advisors say the dam will cause hardship for the 
              powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the 
              powerful, but they are far from guaranteed.</p>
            <p> 　　Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost 
              and benefits of controlling water can help to resolve these conflicts. 
              Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are possible 
              without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, 
              it is hard to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the 
              world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don't need a dam to be saved.

              54. What the author tries to suggest may best be interpreted as 
              _____ . </p>
            <p>A)&quot;It's no use crying over spilt milk&quot;</p>
            <p>B)&quot;More haste, less speed&quot;</p>
            <p>C) &quot;Look before you leap&quot;</p>
            <p>D)&quot;He who laughs last laughs best&quot; <br>
              Passage 2 </p>
            <p> Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without 
              gain? Everywhere you go in America, you hear tales of corporate 
              revival. What is harder to establish is whether the productivity 
              revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for 
              real.</p>
            <p> 　　The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, 
              if you lump manufacturing and services together, productivity has 
              grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster than 
              the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity 
              has increased by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978 
              87 average. The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration 
              is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business 
              cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying 
              trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, 
              a &quot;disjunction&quot; between the mass of business anecdote 
              that points to a leap in productivity and the picture reflected 
              by the statistics.</p>
            <p> Some of this can be easily explanied. New ways of organizing the 
              workplace all that re engineering and downsizing - are only one 
              contribution to the overalll productivity of an economy, which is 
              driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment 
              and machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. 
              Moreover, most of the changes that companies make are intended to 
              keep them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing productivity:switching 
              to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much.</p>
            <p> 　　Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of 
              the business restructuring of recent years may have been ineptly 
              done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much 
              less widely than people suppose.</p>
            <p> 　　Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive 
              of Au Bong Pain, a rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that 
              much &quot;re engineering&quot; has been crude. In many cases, he 
              believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions 
              in cost. His colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many companies 
              have applied re engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping out 
              costs without giving sufficent thought to long term profitability. 
              BBDO's Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work 
              of re engineering consultants as mere rubbish - &quot;the worst 
              sort of ambulance cashing.&quot;<br>
              55. According to the author, the American economic situation is 
              _____ . </p>

            <p>B)at its turning point</p>
            <p>C)much better than it seems </p>
            <p>D)near to complete recovery <br>
              56. The official statistics on productivity growth _____ . </p>
            <p>A)exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle</p>
            <p>B)fall short of businessmen's anticipation</p>
            <p>C)meet the expectation of business people </p>
            <p>D)fail to reflect the true state of economy <br>
              57. The author raises the question &quot;what about pain without 
              gain?&quot; because _____ . </p>

            <p>B)he does not think the productivity revolution works</p>
            <p>C)he wonders if the official statistics are misleading </p>
            <p>D)he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses <br>

            <p>A)Radical reforms are essential for the increase of productivity.</p>
            <p>B)New ways of organizing workplaces may help to increase productivity.</p>
            <p>C)The reduction of costs is not a sure way to gain long term profitability. 
            </p>
            <p>D)The consultants are a bunch of good for nothigns. <br>
              Passage 3 </p>
            <p> 　　Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects 
              of culture. Think of Gallileo's 17th century trial for his rebelling 
              belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake's harsh 
              remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism 
              between sceience and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in 
              this century.</p>
            <p> 　　Until recently, the seientific community was so powerful that 
              it could affort to ignore its critics - but no longer. As funding 
              for science has declined, scientists have attacked &quot;antiscience&quot; 
              in several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, 
              a biologist at the University of Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a 
              mathematician at Rutgers University; and The DemonHaunted World, 
              by Car Sagan of Cornell University.</p>
            <p> 　　Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings 
              such as &quot;The Flight from Science and Reason,&quot; held in 
              New York City in 1995, and &quot;Science in the Age of (Mis)information,&quot;which 
              assembled last June near Buffalo.</p>
            <p> 　　Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. 
              Gross and Levitt find fault primarily with sociologists, philosophers 
              and other academics who have questioned science's objectivity. Sagan 
              is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism 
              and other phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.</p>
            <p> 　　A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience 
              tag has been attached to many other groups as well, from authorities 
              who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks of smallpox 
              virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.</p>
            <p> 　　Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those 
              manifesto, published in 1995, scorns science and longs for return 
              to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does not mean environmentalists 
              concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, 
              as an essay in US News &amp; World Report last May seemed to suggest.</p>
            <p> 　　The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. 
              The true enemies of science, argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, 
              a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question the evidence 
              supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and 
              other consequences of industrial growth.</p>
            <p> 　　Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is 
              in danger of becoming meaningless. &quot;The term 'antiscience' 
              can lump together too many, quite different things,&quot; notes 
              Harvard University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science 
              and Anti Science. &quot;They have in common only one thing that 
              they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more 
              enlightened. &quot;<br>
              59. The word &quot;schism&quot;(Line 4, Paragraph 1) in the context 
              probably means _____ . </p>
            <p>A)confrontation</p>
            <p>B)dissatisfaction</p>
            <p>C)separation </p>
            <p>D)contempt <br>
              60. Paragraphs 2 and 3 are written to _____ . </p>
            <p>A)discuss the cause of the decline of science's power</p>
            <p>B)show the author's symphathy with scientists</p>
            <p>C)explain the way in which science develops </p>
            <p>D)exemplify the division of science and the humanities <br>
              61. Which of the following is true according to the passage? </p>
            <p>A)Environmentalists were blamed for antiscience in an essay.</p>
            <p>B)Politicans are not subject to the labeling of antiscience.</p>
            <p>C)The &quot;more enlightened&quot; tend to tag others as antiscience 
            </p>
            <p>D)Tagging environmentalists as &quot;antiscience&quot; is justifiable 
              <br>
              62. The author's attitude toward the issue of &quot;science vs. 
              antiscience&quot; is _____ . </p>
            <p>A)impartial</p>
            <p>B)subjective</p>
            <p>C)biased </p>
            <p>D)puzzling <br>
              Passage 4 </p>
            <p> 　　Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing 
              more and more regional competition, as population growth in the 
              Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.</p>
            <p> This development - and its strong implications for US politics 
              and economy in years ahead - has enthroned the South as America's 
              most densely populated region for the first time in the history 
              of the nation's head counting.</p>
            <p> 　　Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million 
              people - numerically the third largest growth ever recorded in a 
              single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent, 
              lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.</p>
            <p> Americans have been migrating south and west in larger number 
              since World War II, and the pattern still prevails.</p>
            <p> 　　Three sun belt states - Florida, Texas and California - together 
              had nearly 10 million more people in 1980 than a decade earlier. 
              Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and San Antonio 
              from 15th to 10th - with Cleveland and Washington.DC,dropping out 
              of the top 10.</p>
            <p> 　　Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of 
              the snow belt, census officials say, Nonstop waves of immigrants 
              played a role, too - and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday's 
              &quot;baby boom&quot; generation reached its child bearing years.</p>
            <p> 　　Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west 
              as joined by a related but newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans 
              apparently are looking not just for places with more jobs but with 
              fewer people, too. Some instances-</p>
            <p> ● Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid 
              growth rate - 37.1 percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 
              percent of the US population.</p>
            <p> ●Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 
              53.1 percent respectively. Except fro Florida and Texas, the top 
              10 in rate of growth is composed of Western states with 7.5 million 
              people - about 9 per square mile.</p>
            <p> 　　The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow 
              belt to morebearable climates.</p>
            <p> 　　Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American 
              search for spacious living than in the Far West. There, California 
              added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any 
              other state.</p>
            <p> 　　In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, 
              mostly to other parts of the West. Often they chose - and still 
              are choosing - somewhat colder climates such as Oregon, Idaho and 
              Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization 
              in the Golden State. </p>
            <p> 　　As a result, California's growth rate dropped during the 1970s, 
              to 18.5 percent - little more than two thirds the 1960s growth figure 
              and considerably below that of other Western states.<br>
              Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 
              census provided, America in 1970s _____ . </p>
            <p>A)enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history</p>
            <p>B)witnessed a southwestern shift of population</p>
            <p>C)underwent an unparalleled period of population growth </p>
            <p>D)brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World 
              dWar II <br>
              1. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population 
              movement in that _____ . </p>
            <p>A)it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution 
            </p>
            <p>B)it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants</p>
            <p>C)it reveals the Americans' new persuit of spacious living </p>
            <p>D)it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday's &quot;baby boom&quot; 
              <br>
              2. We can see from the available statistics that _____ . </p>
            <p>A)California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole 
              US</p>
            <p>B)the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located 
              in the West</p>
            <p>C)cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration 
            </p>
            <p>D)Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population 
              <br>
              3. The word &quot;demographers&quot; (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most 
              probably means _____ . </p>
            <p>A)people infavor of the trend of democracy</p>
            <p>B)advocates of migration between states</p>
            <p>C)scientists engaged in the studey of population </p>
            <p>D)conservatives clinging to old patterns of life <br>
              Passage 5 </p>
            <p> 　　Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of 
              isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike 
              most of the world's volcanoes, they are not always found at the 
              boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth's 
              surface; on the contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior 
              of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some 
              cases the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead 
              volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic trails are milestones 
              that mark the passage of the plates.</p>
            <p> 　　That the plates are moving is not beyond dispute. Africa and 
              South America, for example, are moving away from eath other as new 
              material is injected into the sea floor between them. The complementary 
              coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the 
              ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined. 
              The relative motion of the plates carrying these continents has 
              been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect 
              to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect 
              to the earth's interior. It is not possible to determine whether 
              both continents are moving in opposite direcitons or whether one 
              continent is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. 
              Hot spots,anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the 
              measuring instruments needed to resolve the quesiton. From an analysis 
              of the hot spot popultion it appears that the African plate is stationary 
              and that it has not moved during the past 30 million years.</p>
            <p> 　　The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role 
              as a frame of reference. It now appears that they also have an important 
              influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates across 
              the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, 
              the material rising from deeper layer creates a broad dome. As the 
              dome grows, it develops seed fissures(cracks); in at least a few 
              cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, 
              so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus 
              just as earlier theories have explanied the mobility of the continents, 
              so hot spots may explain their mutability(inconstance).<br>

            <p>A)the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth's interior</p>

            <p> 　　They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that 
              scientists had ever decteded: a strip of enourmous cosmic clouds 
              some 15 billion light years from earth. 71) But even more important, 
              it was the farthest that scientists had been able to look into the 
              past, for what they were seeing were the patterns and structures 
              that existed 15 billion years ago. That was just about the moment 
              that the universe was born. What the researchers found was at once 
              both amazing and expected; the US National Aeronautics and Space 
              Administratin's Cosmic Background Explorer satellite -Cobe-had disvocered 
              landmark evidence that the universe did in fact begin with the primeval 
              explosion that has become known as the Big Bang(the theory that 
              the universe originated in an explosion from a single mass of energy).</p>
            <p> 　　72) The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required 
              for the Big Bang, first put forward in the 1920s, to maintain its 
              reign as the dominant explanation of the cosmos. According the the 
              theory, the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, unimaginable 
              dense knot of pure energy that flew outward in all directions, emitting 
              radiation as it went, condensing into particles and then into atoms 
              of gas. Over billions of years, the gas was compressed by gravity 
              into galaxies, stars, plants and eventully, even humans.</p>
            <p> 　　Cobe is designed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers 
              would like to see much smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local 
              objects like clusters and superclusters of galaxies. They shouldn't 
              have long to wait. 73) Astrophysicists working with ground based 
              detectors at the South Pole and balloon borne instruments are closing 
              in on such structures, and may report their findings soon. </p>
            <p> 　　74) If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a 
              triumph for yet another scientific idea, a refinement of the Big 
              Bang called the inflationary universe theory. Inflation says that 
              very early on, the unverse expanded in size by more than a trillion 
              trillion trillion trillionfold in much less than a second, propelled 
              by a sort of antigravity. 75) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation 
              is a scientifically plausible consequence of some respected ideas 
              in elementary particle physics, and many astrophysicists have been 
              conviced for the better part of a decade that it is true. <br>

            <p> 　　Recently, more and more people have seen varieties of promises 
              either from TV, newspaper or from other media. As is shown in the 
              cartoon, even a hen has leanred how to promise. We all know that 
              hen's duty is to lay eggs which should undoutbly consist of most 
              elementary part. But the hen promises what she should do!(图画点题，夹叙夹议)</p>
            <p> 　　With the development of the society and the improvement of people's 
              living standard, more and more attention should be paid to the improvement 
              of quality of service. Therefore, many enterprises and departments 
              promise to better their services so as to meet the people's need 
              better. They are also pleased to invite people to supervise what 
              they have done and will do. But much to our surprise, some of them 
              just say something that they should do. These promises are only 
              laughted at by people. (解释配诗，又有议论)</p>
            <p> 　　In my opinion, doing more is better than proming more. Because 
              people are willing to be served really. All we should lay more emphasis 
              on what we do and how we can virtually improve the level of service. 
              Only in this way can we make people satisfied with what we do. (发表自己的观点)</p>

            <p>Such A Promise</p>
            <p> 　　There is a cartoon with the topic of &quot;Such A Promise&quot; 
              says &quot;Promises are often make in many business, that we welcome 
              your supervisement and will not refuse it.&quot;</p>
            <p> 　　But it's all what they should do and it's not at all necessary 
              to sing this &quot;song of civilization.&quot;(这两段写出了&quot;message 
              conveyed by the cartoon&quot;)</p>
            <p> 　　Yes, it's ture, There are so many people thinking that it's 
              not their obligation to do what they should do. They like to sing 
              that &quot;song of civilization&quot; and pretend they were good 
              to finish their job. But in fact, it's normal. People should finish 
              their jobs heart and soul. Nice men do thier job without any vacant 
              promise. They just do their best. Only such people can improve the 
              development of the country. They are common. But they are needed, 
              they are useful. </p>
            <p> 　　Those who only can say something and always make vacant comments 
              are not practical. They just say and not do. They are unfit for 
              the modernization. They are harmful to our country. And there are 
              so many such people. So we should have a thorough refermation just 
              as we are doing now. We should improve our people's virgin and teach 
              them to do more things than to say. (这两段为评论)</p>

            <p>第三篇</p>
            <p> 　　The carton shows us the messages conveyed. Today, we see messages 
              conveyed in our life, this like the cartoon picture, the hen's promise, 
              the hen's egg who are ensured the egg should be all the age things.</p>
            <p> 　　From the cartoon, we see this recovered some problem. Some promise 
              raised in our social. Firstly, some produties and some companies 
              in order to gain profits, they nelected the peoples's hope and ieads. 
              A serval proty says produce a large of by profitable. Secondly, 
              some unit long for advance in some unite and factory, they seledom 
              songs highly songs, which keep thier majority conditions, this generally 
              made wrong measure to deal with our goverment, our people. Thirdly, 
              this observes let's unpleasured and worried. This cheat factors 
              bring up troulbes in people's life, the people don't know the massages 
              conveyed is true or not. The messages conveyed is conveyed, or isn't 
              conveyed.</p>
            <p> 　　In my opinion that this observes large dangerous our life, the 
              messages conveyed isn't conveyed, and the messages conveyed bring 
              not conveyed. My comments that we improve and critics this observes, 
              Our goverment and our solical must highly deal with this promblem, 
              Our people must save this wrong action, let messages conveyed truely 
              bring our life, let our solical have actually improved this problem,

            <p> 　　From this cartoon, I laugh at the hen keep promises that she 
              ought to do it. Hence, I think that many compnaies keep their promises 
              like this now. Hens should lay eggs like this instead of keeping 
              this promises.</p>
            <p> 　　As Chinese economy is advancing, the commodity become rich. 
              At the same time a lot of products that are not qualified one sold 
              in market places. Although those products do great harm to people, 
              the cases are encouraged by some admistrations because renevues 
              can be gained from this. People complain this deeply.</p>
            <p> 　　As a result, many companies assure people that their products 
              and services are qulified. Consumers are all puzzled by those cases. 
              Why do so many companies keep their promises that they should do?</p>
            <p> It is true that companies may show their advertisement, but they 
              should not have done less than what they have promised. Companies 
              should do their works honestly.(8分)</p>

            <p>PROMISE</p>
            <p> 　　From the cartoon, we can see a hen promises that her eggs are 
              in good qualities. At first sight, you may busrt into laughing, 
              but do you realize what's meaning it hints? (cartoon)</p>
            <p> 　　At present, promise is popular thoughout all the working areas. 
              From radio, television or all kinds of newspaper, we can easily 
              see one advertisement with good promise, such as the quality of 
              goods, the ensurement of reparing, the exchangement, etc. Some sound 
              reasonable, but some are not necessary. </p>
            <p> 　　Some quality are a part of goods, so if it's no use of promising 
              such things. And sometime it may gives rise to bad influence on 
              goods. People may not think the goods are good enough. Make sure 
              good promising is available!(8分)</p>
            <p>第六篇</p>
            <p>Such Promise</p>
            <p> 　　At present, it is popular that all kinds of business and produce 
              both make promise. All businessmen and producers make promise: it 
              is happy for consumers' instructment. But, when the promise is produced 
              by these businessmen and producer's, consumers will find the promise 
              is &quot;false&quot;. Because the promise is these bussinessmen 
              and producers duty which shall be. As a hen produce eggs, the hen 
              promised it produce a egg must be a real egg. Such promise! Is it 
              humor?</p>
            <p> 　　All kinds of business and producers promise is popular. Because 
              there are many bussiness and producers, consumers have rights for 
              selection. These producers make &quot;false&quot; promise for getting 
              many consumers and expanding their sales. In my opinion, such promise 
              isn't necessary. All producers should try their best to enhance 
              their produce quality is vital. Only this, they can make their produce 
              sale more and get more consumers. In modern market economy, these 
              producers will be strong and will defeat other producers. (6分)</p>

              sell false and bad goods. But they ought ot sell true and good goods. 
              Why they impose what they ought to do. I think, first many departments 
              do something that they ought to do. </p>
            <p> 　　Example, some shops sell bad and false goods, so few of shop 
              impose that they do not sell bad and false goods in order to earn

              promise is of no use. </p>
            <p> 　　Give the cartoon, I thought that a promise shout have its reponsibility 
              for the costomber. Like the cartoon discribe, some one or some companies 
              roast their product and it function no less than what there producty 
              is. Therefore it leads to the consumer's fail, so we should plane 
              some politics to prevent this pernomene. First, reinforce the country 
              offercials work. Second, every company should reponside for what 
              you have said and do it correctly. The last, every coustomber should

              to marketoriented economy. It bring us many benefits, including 
              the raising of the material livings and entertainments. However, 
              with the development of market economy, some people who do not observe 
              the law take advantage of the opportunity to make money. </p>
            <p> 　　To some manufacturers, regardless of the quality of products, 
              they only care for making money. They make all sorts of promises, 
              but virtually mean nothing. They do not avoid being invested. Like 
              the drawing in the cartoon, the hen promises that the eggs she lays 
              are bound to contain the three things all the eggs have. But whether 
              the eggs can be eaten, it is another thing. Perhaps, they do not 
              contain nurtrions at all. Thus we see that her promises is not relianble. 
            </p>
            <p> As to the quality of products, people have a great concern to 
              it. 　　　　Inferior products make us suffer not only economally but 
              also psychologily. When we spend some money but get nothing, we 
              are sure to be angry. I hope that there are more laws about the 
              quality of products to protect the consumer. As long as all of us 
              take action, the quality of products will be improved greatly.(1分)</p>

            <p>Quality of products</p>
            <p> 　　in order to improve the quality of products made in this country, 
              quality control will have to be effectively inforced. Many people 
              have complained about products that don't work, sometimes shortly 
              after they are bought, bikes that break down, radios that do not 
              work, and even pens that refuse to write after a few words.</p>
            <p> 　　Unless the quality of products is improved, people in our country 
              will tend to buy foerign made products, we notice that many people 
              prefer Japanese electronic products (radio, television, ect.) to 
              those made here. It is said that the foreign made products are sure 
              to be better than those homemade.</p>
            <p> 　　Once quality control comes into force, domestic products can 
              gradually best down the foreign products. As a result, buyers will 
              turn back to homemade products. the sales of Chinese products within 
              the contary and even outsidethe century will increase.(0分)</p>

            <p> 　　From the carton above, we can see an odd thing. The eggs - having 
              been known as round. But his producer has to announce and grarante 
              his reality. It reflects that between producers and consumers they 
              distrust each other. </p>
            <p> 　　We live in a material world. Making money has become the most 
              important thing. Because many symbolizes one's success and ability 
              and can bring many benefits. So some products make fake production 
              in sake of earning more money. when consumers buy thesefake production 
              and are harmed, they don't believe producers no longer. They begin 
              to seek productions safe and high quantity. Therefore, product, 
              have to guarantee to consumers.</p>
            <p> 　　In fact, in a long run, these cheating do harm to not only consumers, 
              but also cheaters. In international competitions, quantity is the 
              most important. High quantity bring good fame, and can bring good 
              profits and can modify the competition. Above all, it can quarantee 
              your comparison more and more large. </p>
            <p> 　　Distrust can cantagions, so can trust. Honest is one of the 
              most important virtues. We should keep honest and make the consumption 
              equality. The government should take actions to regulate market. 
              Laws should be make to warn fake producers. And our market will 
              be more stable and prosperity. (0分)</p>

            <p>Fake and inferior goods</p>
            <p> 　　Fake and inferior goods can be seen everywhere. Almost every 
              kind of goods not only in small shops, but in big department stores 
              or markets, from daily necessies to industrical material, from soft 
              drinking to clotheses. It would be fatal for the government to underestimate 
              the destructive power of it.</p>
            <p> 　　Fake and inferior good do lots harm for us. First, it damages 
              not only the consumers interest, but their health and even their 
              lives. Second most of fake and inferior good will damage the famous 
              brands. Third more and more fake and inferior goods makes the consumers 
              hesitate before choosing goods.</p>
            <p> 　　Faced with fake and inferior goods we must take measure. First 
              of all, helping to consumer improve their recognize. Second helping 
              the consumer to distinguish fake and inferior good. So we can controlled 
              and elimited fake and inferior goods. (0分)</p>

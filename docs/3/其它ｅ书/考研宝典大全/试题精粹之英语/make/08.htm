            <p> Sleep is divided into periods of so-called REM sleep, characterized 
              by rapid eye movements and dreaming, and longer periods of non-REM 
              sleep. 41 kind of sleep is at all well-understood , but REM sleep 
              is 42 to serve some restorative function of the brain. The purpose 
              of non-REM sleep is even more 43 .The new experiments, such as these 
              44 for the first time at a recent meeting of the Society for Sleep

              　　　　　　　　Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehensinn<br>
              Passage l</p>
            <p> Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know 
              of. It serves directly to assist a rapid distribotion of goods at 
              reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home market and so 
              making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. 
              By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards 
              of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased 
              need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. 
              It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your 
              daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your 
              television licence would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or 
              tube would cost 20 per cent more.</p>
            <p> And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee 
              of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart 
              from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament gov- ern the 
              terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product 
              that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might 
              fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. 
              He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good 
              sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see 
              an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know 
              that the article does what is claimed for it , and that it represents 
              good value.</p>
            <p> Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community 
              than any other force I can think of. There is one more point I feel 
              I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television</p>
            <p>personality declare that he was against advertising because it 
              persuades rather than informs. He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. 
              Of course advertising seeks to persuade.</p>
            <p> If its message were confined merely to information-and that in 
              itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even 
              a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive——advertising 
              would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps 
              that is what the well-known television personality wants.</p>
            <p>51 . By the first sentence of the passage the author means that__.</p>
            <p>(A) he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising</p>
            <p>(B) everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming</p>
            <p>(C) advertising costs money like everything else</p>
            <p>(D) it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising</p>
            <p>52. In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the 
              advantages of advertising?</p>
            <p>(A) Securing greater fame. (C) Enhancing living standards.</p>
            <p>(B) Providing more jobs. (D) Reducing newspaper cost.</p>
            <p>53 . The author deems that the well-known TV personality is_.</p>
            <p>(A) very precise in passing his judgement on advertising</p>
            <p>(B) interested in nothing but the buyers' attention</p>
            <p>(C) correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information</p>
            <p>(D) obviously partial in his views on advertising</p>
            <p>54. In the author's opinton,__.</p>
            <p>(A) advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing</p>
            <p>(B) advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them 
              over</p>
            <p>(C) there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer</p>
            <p>(D) the buyer is not interested in getting information from an 
              advenisement<br>
              Passage 2</p>
            <p> There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the 
              other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth 
              as an external result or product that can easily be identified and 
              measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades 
              improve, the foreigner who learns a new language-all these are examples 
              of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts.</p>
            <p> By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult 
              to determine, since by definition it is a journey and not the specific 
              signposts or landmarks along the way.The process is not the road 
              itsetf, but rather the attitudes and feellings people have, their 
              caution or courge, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected 
              obstacles. In this process ,the journey never really ends; there 
              are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new 
              challenges to accept .</p>
            <p> In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness 
              to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility 
              that they may &quot;fail&quot;at first. How we see our-selves as 
              we try a new way of being is essential to our abitity to grow. Do 
              we perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend 
              to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. 
              Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity 
              can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step 
              until we know the ground is safe. Do we thiQk we're slow to adapt 
              to change or that we' re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? 
              Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.</p>
            <p> These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable 
              and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we do not confront 
              and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we protect ourselves 
              too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell 
              of our own making .</p>
            <p>55 . A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth 
              then__.</p>

            <p>(B) he has made great efforts in his work</p>
            <p>(C) he is keen on leaming anything new</p>
            <p>(D) he has tried to determine where he is on his journey</p>
            <p>56. In the author' s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process 
              would__.</p>
            <p>(A) succeed in climbing up the social ladder</p>
            <p>(B) judge his ability to glow from his own achievements</p>
            <p>(C) face difficulties and take up challenges</p>

            <p>57. When the author says &quot;a new way of being&quot; (line 3, 
              para. 3) he is referring to__.</p>
            <p>(A) a new approach to experiencing the world (C) a new method of 
              perceiving ourselves</p>
            <p>(B) a new way of taking risks (D) a new system of adaptation to 
              change</p>
            <p>58. For personal growth ,the author advocates all of the following 
              except_.</p>
            <p>(A) curiosity about more chances ( C) open-mindedness to new experiences</p>
            <p>(B) promptness in self-adaptation (D) avoidance of intemal fears 
              and doubts<br>
              Passage 3</p>
            <p> In such a changing , complex society formerly simple solutions 
              to informational needs become complicated. Many of life' s problems 
              which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues 
              are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where 
              to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert 
              advice to accept are qaestions facing many people today.</p>
            <p> In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since 
              World War Ⅱ. As families move away from their stable community, 
              their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, 
              the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence 
              that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy 
              and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the 
              simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned 
              subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended 
              family must be consciously learned .</p>
            <p> Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. 
              The individual now has more information available than any generation, 
              and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to 
              his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming and 
              sometimes even overwhelming .</p>
            <p> Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development 
              of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information 
              with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible 
              before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts 
              of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate 
              specific information . Telecommunications developments enable the 
              sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic 
              mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have 
              extended the power of communications to report events at the instant 
              of occurrence. Expertise can be shared world wide through teleconferencing 
              , and problems in dispute can be settled without the parttcipants 
              leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference 
              site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and 
              the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information 
              available to more people.</p>
            <p> In this world of change and complexity , the need for infomtatian 
              is of greatest importance.</p>
            <p>Those people who have accurate , reliable up-to-date information 
              to solve the day-to-day problems,the critical problems of their 
              business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. &quot;Knowledge 
              is power&quot; may well be the truest saying and access to information 
              may be the most critical requirement of all people.</p>
            <p>59. The word &quot;it&quot; (line 3, para. 2) most probably refers 
              to__.</p>
            <p>(A) the lack of stable communities</p>
            <p>(B) the breakdown of informal information channels</p>
            <p>(C) the increased mobility of families</p>
            <p>(D) the growing number of people moving from place to place</p>
            <p>60. The main problem people may encounter today arises form the 
              fact that__.</p>
            <p>(A) they have to learn new things consciously</p>
            <p>(B) they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy 
              information</p>
            <p>(C) they have difficulty obtaining the needed informatton readily</p>
            <p>(D) they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended 
              family.</p>
            <p>61 . From the passage we can infer that__.</p>
            <p>(A) electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting 
              messages</p>
            <p>(B) it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in 
              an information era</p>
            <p>(C) people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences</p>
            <p>(D) events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites</p>
            <p>62. We can learn from the last paragraph that __.</p>
            <p>(A) it is necessary to obtain as much</p>
            <p>(B) people should make the best use of the information</p>
            <p>(C) we shoutd realize the importance of accumulating information 
              .</p>
            <p>(D) it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently<br>
              Passage 4</p>
            <p> Personality is to a large extent inherent——A-type parents usually 
              bring about A-type offspring. But the environment must also have 
              a profound effect, since if competition is important to the parents, 
              it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.</p>
            <p> One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school , 
              which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. 
              Too many schools adopt the 'win at all costs' moral standard and 
              measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion 
              for making children compete against their classmates or against 
              the clock produces a two-layer system , in which competitive Atypes 
              seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen 
              to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides 
              , the first marathon runner , dropped dead seconds after saying: 
              ' Rejoice, we conquer! '</p>
            <p> By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate 
              emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils 
              to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition 
              by examination are somewhat questionable , but competition in the 
              certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.</p>
            <p> Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A-youngsters 
              change into B' s. The world needs A types, and schools have an important 
              duty to try to fit a child' s personality to his possible future 
              employment . It is top management .</p>
            <p> If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, 
              more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps 
              selection for the caring professions , especially medicine,could 
              be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations 
              as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our 
              doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B's are important and should 
              be encouraged.</p>
            <p>63 . According to the passage , A-type individuals are usually__.</p>
            <p>(A) impatient ( B) considerate ( C) aggressive (D) agreeable</p>
            <p>64. The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations 
              at schoois because__.</p>
            <p>(A) the pressure is too great on the students</p>
            <p>(B) some students are bound to fail</p>
            <p>(C) failure rates are too high</p>
            <p>(D) the results of exarninations are doubtful</p>
            <p>65 . The selection of medical professionals are currentiy based 
              on__.</p>
            <p>(A) candidates' sensitivity (C) competitive spirit</p>
            <p>(B) academic acbievements (D) surer values</p>
            <p>66. From the passage we can draw the oonclusion that__.</p>
            <p>(A) the personality of a child is well established at birth</p>
            <p>(B) family innuence dominates the shaping of one' s characteristics 
              .</p>
            <p>(C) the development of one' s personality is due to multiple factors</p>
            <p>(D) B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society<br>
              Passage 5</p>
            <p> That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of 
              an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. 
              Learning could not occur without the function popularly named memory.Constant 
              practice has such as effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance 
              on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding 
              these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory , remembering 
              being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve 
              any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on 
              memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering 
              many earlier experiences .</p>
            <p> Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a 
              task or for any learned material. Over a period of no practice what 
              has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive consquences 
              may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting 
              can seem to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can 
              be intffpreted to have survived through a process of natural selection 
              in animals.Inded, when one's memory of an emotionally painful experience 
              lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produoe relief. Nevertheless, 
              an evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand 
              how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural 
              selection.</p>
            <p> In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its 
              possible aspects,it is helpful to consider what would happen if 
              memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in 
              time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out,providing 
              clues for inferring duration. Without fotgetting, adaptive ability 
              would suffer, for example ,learned behaviour that might have been 
              correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people 
              who (by or-dinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday 
              activities were full of confusion. This forgetting seems to serve 
              that survival of the individual and the species.</p>
            <p> Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited 
              capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through 
              forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made between 
              learning or memory storage ( input) and forgetting (output) . Indeed, 
              there is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly 
              related to how much they have learned. Such data offers gross support 
              of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.</p>
            <p>67. From the evolutionary point of view,__.</p>
            <p>(A) forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive 
              .</p>
            <p>(B) if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be 
              very adaptive</p>
            <p>(C) the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual' 
              s adaptability</p>
            <p>(D) sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences</p>
            <p>68. According to the passage, if a person never forgot ,__.</p>
            <p>(A) he would survive best (C) his ability to learn would be enhanced</p>
            <p>(B) he would have a lot of trouble (D) the evolution of memory 
              would stop</p>
            <p>69. From the last paragraph we know that__.</p>
            <p>(A) forgetfulness is a response to learning</p>
            <p>(B) the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output 
              systenl</p>
            <p>(C) memory is a compensation for forgetting</p>
            <p>(D) the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because 
              forgetting occurs</p>
            <p>70. In this article, the author tries to interpret the function 
              of__.</p>

              　　　　　Part Ⅳ English-Chinese Translation</p>
            <p> The standardized educational or psychological test that are widely 
              used to aid in selecting,</p>
            <p>classifying, assigning, or promoting students, employees, and military 
              personnel have been the target of recent attacks in books, magazines, 
              the daily press, and even in congress. 71 )The target is wrong, 
              for in attacking the tests, critics divert attention form the fault 
              that lies with ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests themselves 
              are merely tools , with characteristics that can be measured with 
              reasonable precision under specified conditions. Whether the results 
              will be valuable , meaningless, or even misleading depends partly 
              upon the tool itself but largely upon the user .</p>
            <p> All informed predictions of future performance are based upon 
              some knowledge of relevant past performance: school grades, research 
              productivity, sales records, or whatever is appropriate. 72 )How 
              well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends 
              upon the amount , reliability , and appropriateness of the information 
              used and on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone 
              who keeps careful score knows that the information available is 
              always incomplete and that the predictions are always subject to 
              error.</p>
            <p> Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They 
              provide a quick, objective method of getting some kinds of information 
              about what a person learned , the sktlls he has developed, or the 
              kind of person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, 
              the same advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. 
              73)Whether to use tests. other kinds of information, or both in 
              a particular situation depends, therefore, upon the evidence from 
              experience concerning comparative validity and upon such factors 
              as cost and availability.</p>
            <p> 74)In general,the tests work most effectivelv when the qualities 
              to be measured can be most precisely defined and least effectively 
              when what is to be messured or predicted cannot be well defined. 
              Properly used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable 
              information about many people Sometimes they identify students whose 
              high potential has not been previously recognized, but there are 
              many things they do not do. 75)For example, they do not compensate 
              for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an underprivileged 
              youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.<br>

            <p>71．把标准化测试作为抨击目标是错误的，因为在抨击这类测试时，批评者不考虑其弊病来自人们对测试不甚了解或使用不当。</p>
            <p>72．这些预测在多大程度上为后来的表现所证实，这取决于所采用信息的数量、可靠性和适宜性，以及解释这些信息的技能和才智。</p>
            <p>73．因此，在某一特定情况下，究竟是采用测试还是其他种类的信息，或是两者同时使用，须凭有关相对效度的经验依据而定，也取决于诸如费用和有无来源等因素。</p>
            <p>74．一般地说，当所要测定的特征能很精确地界定时，测试最为有效；而当所要测定或预测的东西不能明确地界定时，测试的效果则最差。</p>
            <p>75．例如，测试并不弥补明显的社会不公；因此，它们不能说明一个物质条件差的年轻人，如果在较好的环境下成长的话，会有多大才干。</p>

            <p> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1</p>
            <p> 　　Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child 
              at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging 
              from the drastic experiment of Frederick Ⅱ in the thirteenth century, 
              it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak 
              if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.</p>
            <p> 　　All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there 
              was more than lack of language here. What was missing was good mothering. 
              Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the 
              capacity to survive is seriously affected.</p>
            <p> 　　Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. 
              Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most 
              often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the 
              signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language 
              rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected , the ideal time 
              for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so</p>
            <p>easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right 
              time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has 
              passed.</p>
            <p> 　　Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence 
              and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started 
              late in a child who eventuaLly turns out to be of high IQ.</p>
            <p>　　At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at 
              twelve months he can speak simple words and understand simple commands; 
              at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to fifty words. 
              At three he knows about l ,000 words which he can put into sentences, 
              and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style 
              rather than grammar.</p>
            <p> 　　Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity 
              to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that 
              of the monkey, if the complex system which enables a child to connect 
              the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattem &quot;toy-bear&quot; 
              . And even more incredible is the young brain' s ability to pick 
              out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to 
              analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new 
              ways.</p>
            <p> 　　But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction 
              between the mother and the child , where the mother recognizes the 
              signals in the child' s babbling ( 咿呀学语) , grasping and smiling, 
              and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals 
              dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends 
              out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child ' s non-verbal 
              signals is essential to the growth and development of language.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>31 . The purpose of Frederick II's experiment was__</p>
            <p>A. to prove that children are born with the ability to speak</p>
            <p>B. to discover what language a child would speak without hearing 
              any human speech</p>
            <p>C. to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching 
              a child to speak</p>
            <p>D. to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language</p>
            <p>32. The reason some children are backward in speaking is most　probably 
              that__</p>
            <p>A. they are incapable of learning language rapidly</p>
            <p>B. they are exposed to too much language at once</p>
            <p>C. their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak 
            </p>
            <p>D. their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them </p>
            <p>33 . What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that</p>
            <p>A. he is born with the capacity to speak </p>
            <p>B. he has a brain more complex than an animal's </p>
            <p>C. he can produce his own sentences </p>
            <p>D. he owes his speech ability to good nursing </p>
            <p>34. Which of the fonowing can NOT be inferred from the passage? 
            </p>
            <p>A. The faculty of speech is inborn in man. </p>
            <p>B. Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language 
              learning.</p>
            <p>C. The child' s brain is highly selective.</p>
            <p>D. Most children learn their language in definite stages.</p>
            <p>35. If a child starts to speak later than others, he will</p>
            <p>A. have a high IQ</p>
            <p>B. be less intelligent</p>
            <p>C. be insensitive to verbal signals</p>
            <p>D. not necessarily be backward</p>
            <p> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　2</p>
            <p> In general , our society is becoming one of giant enterprises 
              directed by a bureaucratic ( 官僚主义的)management in which man becomes 
              a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling</p>
            <p>is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped 
              music, and by psychologists and &quot;human-relations&quot; experts; 
              yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become 
              powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work 
              and that he is bored with it. In fact , the blue-and the white-collar 
              workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated 
              machines and bureaucratic management .</p>
            <p> 　　The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might 
              find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they 
              are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life. 
              They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental 
              realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent 
              and productive human beings.</p>
            <p> 　　Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their 
              lives are no less empty than those of their subordinates. They are 
              even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly competitive 
              race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary 
              but even more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their 
              first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the tight 
              mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on 
              they are tested again and again-by the psychologists, for whom testing 
              is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, 
              sociability, capacity to get along , etc. This constant need to 
              prove that one is as good as or better than one' s fellow-competitor 
              creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness 
              and illness.</p>
            <p> 　　Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode 
              of production'or to nine-teenth-century &quot;free enterprise&quot; 
              capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning 
              to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming 
              our social system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism 
              in which maximal production and consumption are ends in themselves 
              into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development 
              of his　potentialities those of love and of reason-are the aims of 
              all social arrangements. Production and consumption should serve 
              only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>36. By &quot;a well-oiled cog in the machinery&quot; the author 
              intends to render the idea that man is</p>
            <p>A. a necessary part of the society though each individual's function 
              is negligible</p>
            <p>B. working in complete harmony with the rest of the society</p>
            <p>C. an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, 
              though functioning smoothly</p>
            <p>D. a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly</p>
            <p>37 . The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees 
              is that</p>
            <p>A. they are likely to lose their jobs</p>
            <p>B. they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life</p>
            <p>C. they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence</p>
            <p>D. they are deprtved of their individuality and independence</p>
            <p>38. From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs 
              to those</p>
            <p>A. who are at the bottom of the society</p>
            <p>B. who are higher up in their social status</p>
            <p>C. who prove better than their fellow-competitors</p>
            <p>D. who could keep far away from this competitive world</p>
            <p>39. To solve the present social problems the author suggests that 
              we should</p>
            <p>A. resort to the production mode of our ancestors</p>
            <p>B. offer higher wages to the workers and employees</p>
            <p>C. enable man to fully develop his potentialities</p>
            <p>D. take the fundamental realities for granted</p>
            <p>40 . The author's attitude towards industrialism might best be 
              summarized as one of __</p>
            <p>A. approval B. dissatisfaction</p>
            <p>C. suspicion D. tolerance</p>
            <p> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　3</p>
            <p> 　　When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses 
              of action open to him: he can give the invention to the world by 
              publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.</p>
            <p> 　　A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an 
              inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period 
              of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to 
              the public after that period terminates.</p>
            <p>　　Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of 
              a patent extended to alter this normal process of events. The longest 
              extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for 
              color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for 
              most of the patent' s normal life there was no colour TV to receive 
              and thus no hope of reward for the invention.</p>
            <p> 　　Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, 
              the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain 
              details of literally millions of ideas that are free for any-</p>
            <p>one to use and , if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. 
              Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the 
              high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one 
              sure way of avoiding violation of any other inventor' s right is 
              to plagiarize a dead patent.</p>
            <p>　　Likewise , because publication of an idea in any other form permanently 
              invalidates further patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe 
              to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological 
              advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.</p>
            <p> 　　Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns 
              that most &quot;new&quot; ideas are, in fact, as old as the hills. 
              It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity 
              or</p>
            <p>dedication , or through the availability of new technology, that 
              makes news and money. The basic patent for the theory of magnetic 
              recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind</p>
            <p>television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. 
              Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent 
              for a cart with the horse at the rear.</p>

            <p> 　　Although interior design has existed since the beginning of 
              architecture , its development into a specialized field is really 
              quite recent. Interior designers have become important partly because 
              of the many functions that might be (46) in a single large building.</p>
            <p> The importance of interior design becomes (47) when we realize 
              how much time we (48) surrounded by four walls. Whenever we need 
              to be indoors, we want our surroundings to be ( 49) attractive and 
              comfortable as possible. We also expect (50 ) place to be appropri-</p>
            <p>ate to its use. You would be (51 ) if the inside of your bedroom 
              were suddenLy changed to look (52) the inside of a restaurant. And 
              you wouldn' t feel (53 ) in a business office that has the appearance 
              of a school.</p>
            <p> 　　It soon becomes clear that the interior designer' s most important 
              basic (54) . is the function of the particular (55 ) . For example 
              , a theater with poor sight lines, poor sound-shaping aualitles 
              , and (56) few entries and exits will not work for ( 57) purpose 
              , no matter how beautifully it might be ( 58) . Nevertheless, (59) 
              for any kind of space, lighting and decoration of everything from 
              ceiling to floor. (60) addition, the designer must usually select 
              furniture or</p>
            <p>design built-in furniture , according to the functions that need

            <p>Ⅴ. Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
              underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)</p>
            <p> (71 ) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the 
              expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it 
              is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned　about and 
              given precise and exact expianation. There is no more difference, 
              but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental 
              operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person , 
              as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of 
              a butcher　weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations 
              of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means 
              of his balance and finely graded weights. (72) It is not that the 
              scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in 
              the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that 
              the latter is a much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate 
              in its measurement than the former.</p>
            <p> 　　You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some 
              familiar examples. (73) You have all heard it repeated that men 
              of science work by means of induction (归纳法) and deduction, that 
              by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage 
              to extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out of these, 
              by some special skill of their own, they buiLd up their theories. 
              (74) And it is imagined by many that the operations of the common 
              mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that 
              they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear 
              all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of 
              science must be</p>
            <p>constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you 
              will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are 
              quite wrong , and that all these terrible apparatus are being used 
              by</p>
            <p>yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.</p>
            <p> 　　There is a well-known incident in one of Motiere's plays, where 
              the author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told 
              that he had been talking prose (散文) during the whole of his life. 
              In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, and be delighted 
              with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been acting on the 
              principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during the same 
              period. (75)Plobably there is not one here who has not in the course 
              of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of　reasoning, 
              of the very same kind, though differing in degree,as that which 
              a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena.</p>

            <p>71．科学研究的方法不过是人类思维活动的必要表达方式，也就是对一切现象进行思索并给以精确而严谨解释的表达方式。</p>
            <p>72．这并不是说面包师或卖肉者所用的磅秤和化学家所用的天平在构造原理或工作方式上存在差别，而是说与前者相比，后者是一种更精密得多的装置，因而在计量上必然更准确得多。</p>
            <p>73．你们都多次听说过，科学家是用归纳法和演绎法工作的，他们用这些方法，在某种意义上说，力求从自然界找出某些自然规律，然后他们根据这些规律，用自己的某种非同一般的本领，建立起他们的理论。</p>
            <p>74．许多人以为，普通人的思维活动根本无法与科学家的思维过程相比，认为这些思维过程必须经过某种专门训练才能掌握。</p>
            <p>75．在座的诸位中，大概不会有人一整天都没有机会进行一连串复杂的思考活动，这些思考活动与科学家在探索自然现象原因时所经历的思考活动，尽管复杂程度不同，但在类型上是完全一样的。</p>

              (Counting his money as he picks it up; Joe looks on grimly)</p>
            <p>Now, look at that: six thousand five hundred--ah, not bad, that's 
              ten bucks. </p>
            <p><br>
              (As the dealer gathers the cards back and Joe does up his tie)</p>

              CARD PLAYER 1</p>
            <p>Couldn't be anything to do with the fact that you're ahead? </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>It works out fine for me: this is my last five thousand and you

              down by a park bench. Princess Ann is lying on it and Joe glances

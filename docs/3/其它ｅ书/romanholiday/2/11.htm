              toast)</p>

            <p>If it, if it wasn't for that hair, I- I- I'd swear that--</p>
            <p>(Joe kicks his chair back and Irving falls to the ground. Ann screams 
              in shock. Two men help him up, muttering words in Italian.)</p>

              IRVING</p>

            <p>Yes.), I almost hurt myself?! Joe, I didn't slip! </p>

              JOE</p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>(back to Ann; walking to the door, his arm around Irving's shoulder 
              as if he needs help)</p>
            <p>Will you excuse us for a minute? </p>

              shoulders, as Irving continues to argue.)</p>

            <p>Have you got your letter? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>What's that got to do with it? </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>Have you got it? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Yeah! but what are you tryin' to do to me? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(firmly, as Irving tries to pull his arm away)</p>
            <p>Listen: what would you do for five grand? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(he ceases struggling)</p>
            <p>Five grand? </p>

            <p>Yeah. </p>

              sitting down. Speaking in low tones)</p>
            <p>Now, she doesn't know who I am or what I do. Look, Irving, this 
              is my story; I dug it up, I gotta protect it! </p>

              of the ornamentations which divide the width of the steps, licking 
              her icecream. Joe runs up the opposite side, out of view, and then 
              walks across the width of the steps, behind her. He walks down the 
              steps towards her, and walking past her, looks round pretending

            <p>Mr. Bradley: I have a confession to make. </p>

            <p>Yes, I... ran away last night, from school. </p>

            <p>No, nothing like that. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>Well, it were only meant to be for an hour or two. They gave me 
              something last night to make me sleep. </p>

              her hands clean)</p>
            <p>Now I'd better get a taxi and go back. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, look: before you do, why don't you take a little time for 
              yourself? </p>

              ANN</p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>I could do some of the things I've always wanted to. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>Oh, you can't imagine... I'd, I'd like to do </p>

            <p>whatever I'd like, the whole day long! </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>Yes, and I'd, </p>

            <p>I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe; and look in shop windows; walk

              (Joe looks at the blue sky doubtfully)</p>
            <p>Have fun, and maybe some excitement. It doesn't seem much to you, 
              does it? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>It's great. Tell you what: why don't we do all those things--together.

            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>But don't you have to work? </p>

            <p>Work? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Standing up)</p>
            <p>No! Today's gonna be a holiday. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(playfully)</p>
            <p>But you'll want to do a lot of silly things. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(taking her hand)</p>
            <p>Don't I? First wish: one sidewalk cafe, coming right up--I know 
              just the place: </p>
            <p><br>
              (he gently pulls her up, setting off down the steps)</p>

            <p>(Joe and Ann sit at a table at Rocca's, watching the traffic go 
              past. Joe sits watching as she eats a bread roll.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>What'll the people at school say when they see your new haircut?

            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(laughing)</p>
            <p>They'll have a fit. What would they say if they knew I'd spent 
              the night in your room? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(he looks around self-consciously, leaning closer, playfully)</p>
            <p>Well, er, I'll tell you what: you don't tell your folks and I won't 
              tell mine. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(smiling)</p>
            <p>It's a pact. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Now, what would you like to drink? </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>(casually)</p>
            <p>Champagne, please. </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>(pausing, slightly taken aback at her extravagance; to the waiter 
              walking past)</p>
            <p>Er, commerierie*, er... </p>
            <p><br>
              WAITER</p>
            <p>(bending down, inbetween Joe and Ann)</p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>Champagne. </p>
            <p><br>

            <p>Well, er, champagne </p>
            <p><br>
              (Italian)</p>
            <p>for the senorina and er, cold coffee for me. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The waiter acknowledges in Italian, bows then leaves.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Must be quite a life you have in that school--champagne for lunch.

            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>The last was my father's anniversary. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Wedding? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>No, it was.. </p>
            <p><br>
              (hesitating)</p>
            <p>the fortieth anniversary of umm...the day he got his job. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Forty years on the job; what do you know about that... </p>
            <p><br>
              (Probing her further)</p>
            <p>What does he do? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(thinking, cautiously)</p>
            <p>Well...mostly you might call it...public relations. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Oh, well, that's hard work. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Yes, I wouldn't care for it. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Does he? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I've...heard him complain about it. </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>Why doesn't he quit? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit--unless 
              it's actually unhealthy for them to continue. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(as the waiter delivers the drinks)</p>
            <p>Uh-huh. Well, here's to his health then. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(the waiter places a straw by her wine glass)</p>
            <p>You know: that's what everybody says. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(after they drink)</p>
            <p>It's alright? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(sitting back in her chair, relaxing, playing with the straw)</p>
            <p>Yes, thank you. What is your work? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(now he stammers nervously)</p>
            <p>Oh, I'm er, in the selling game. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Really? how interesting. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Uh-huh. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>What do you sell? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(he looks blank for a moment then, on hearing a horse in the street 
              passing by, looks up at it; turning to her)</p>
            <p>Er, fertilizer; er, chemicals, you know? Chemicals--stuff like 
              that. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Ann is somewhat unconvinced then, putting the straw in her mouth, 
              blows the wrapper off. Joe looks up as it flies over the table. 
              He smiles at Ann who laughs, very pleased with herself, holding 
              the wrapper in her mouth. Joe looks up, brightly; standing up, shaking 
              his hand as irving comes over.)</p>

              JOE</p>

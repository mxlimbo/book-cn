              JOE</p>
            <p>Hey, now, don't fall asleep again. </p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>(first speaks something in Italian)</p>
            <p>Where are we- we going? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe says something in Italian, impatiently.)</p>
            <p>Ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Turns back around.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Look, now where do you wanna to go? Hmmm? Where shall I take you? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              (Holding her jaw, shaking her head; Ann moans in annoyance)</p>
            <p>Where do- where do- where do you live? Huh? huh? Come on. Come 
              on, </p>
            <p><br>
              (lightly slapping her face with his hand)</p>
            <p>where do you live? </p>
            <p><br>
              (The driver looks back, unimpressed)</p>
            <p>Come on, where do you live?! </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(mumbling, half-asleep)</p>
            <p>I....ohhhhh....Colliseum. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(hopelessy; to the cab driver)</p>
            <p>She lives in the Colliseum. </p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>(shakes his head)</p>
            <p>It's wrong address. Now look, senor: for me it is very late tonight 
              ... </p>
            <p><br>
              (some Italian)</p>
            <p>... wife ... </p>
            <p><br>
              (more Italian)</p>
            <p>... I have three bambinos--three bambinos, you know, bambino? </p>
            <p><br>
              (he pretends to cry like a small child)</p>
            <p>My- my taxi go home, I- I go home er to- together. Senor--. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(giving up, sitting back)</p>
            <p>Villa Marguta, fifty-one. </p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>(pleased, finally)</p>
            <p>Villa Marguta, fifty-one. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Pleased)</p>
            <p>Oh, some Italian! </p>
            <p>(The taxi drives off. The cab arrives outside the address.)</p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>Yes, Villa Marguta fifty-one. <br>
              some Italian I am very happy. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe looks grimly at Ann, asleep beside him)</p>
            <p>Thousand lira some Italian. </p>
            <p>(Joe responds in Italian. He reaches into his breast pocket then, 
              remembering, his trouser one and gives the driver the money.)</p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>One, two, three, four mila*. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Gives him back some.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Says something in Italian then gives him back the money. The driver 
              thanks him in Italian.)</p>
            <p>Ok, ok. Now look: take a little bit of that; take her wherever 
              she wants to go. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The cabbie thinks for a moment, unsure)</p>
            <p>Hmmm? Capito? Capito. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Some Italian. The driver nods and they say goodbye to each other. 
              The driver takes one look at Ann sitting asleep and quickly calls 
              out to Joe as he leaves.)</p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>Oh- no, no; moment, moment, moment! No, no, no </p>
            <p><br>
              (the cabbie pulls him over by the arm)</p>
            <p>(JOE Alright). No, no, no. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(leaning down to the window)</p>
            <p>Alright, alright; look: as soon as she wakes up, see? she tell 
              you where she want to go. Ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>Moment, moment: my taxi not for sleep; my taxi--no sleep. You understand? 
              you understand? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Look, look, pal: this is not my problem, see? I never see her before. 
              Huh? Ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              CAB DRIVER</p>
            <p>It's not your problem, it's not my problem. What you want: you 
              don't want girl, yeah? Me don't want girl--. Police: maybe she want 
              girl. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(he relents)</p>
            <p>Stay calmo, stay calmo, ok, ok, ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              (some Italian, reassuring him as he opens the cab door and drags 
              Ann out.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(Joe walks up the steps, followed by Ann, head down barely able 
              to keep awake. He arrives at the front door. As he stops, leaning 
              forward to open it, Ann rests her head on his shoulder. Before going 
              through he straightens causing her to stand up, balancing herself, 
              and then goes through; Ann follows. He shuts the door behind her, 
              taking her by the hand up the steps. Without thinking she walks 
              around the outside of the small spiral stairwell instead of following 
              him up so Joe turns her around with his hand, leaning over the railing 
              from above (ANN blissfully unaware as he leads her around So happy.), 
              and leads her back around to the bottom of the steps (ANN So happy.) 
              and up the right way.)</p>
            <p>(She staggers up steps after him, stopping by a door as Joe goes 
              to unlock his one a few steps up. In her stupor, she raises her 
              hand and is about to knock on the neighbour's door when Joe sees 
              her, running over to catch her hand just in time. He leads her to 
              the door and unlocks it. He goes in and turns on the light.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(muttering as Ann follows him in)</p>
            <p>Out of my head. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He shuts the door behind her.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Is this the elevator? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(offended)</p>
            <p>It's my room. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He turns on a lamp at the other end of the room, by the bathroom 
              door.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(she almost topples over, walking to the bed and putting a gloved 
              hand on the endboard to steady herself)</p>
            <p>I'm terribly sorry to mention it, but the dizziness is getting 
              worse. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Looking around)</p>
            <p>Can I sleep here? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>That's the general idea. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He walks over and opens a wardrobe on the landing next to the front 
              door.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(poetically)</p>
            <p>Can I have a silk nightgown with rosebuds on it? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(walking over to Ann, presenting her with some pyjamas)</p>
            <p>I'm afraid you'll have to rough it tonight--in these. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(with delight, taking them)</p>
            <p>Pyjamas! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Sorry, honey, but I haven't worn a nightgown in years. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He goes over to open another cupboard by the lamp.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Will you help me get undressed, please? </p>
            <p><br>
              (she stands ready, head raised expectantly.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(pauses, unsure, then goes to her)</p>
            <p>Er...ok. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He undoes her necktie, sliding it away fom her neck; presenting 
              it to her)</p>
            <p>Er, there you are; you can handle the rest. </p>
            <p><br>
              (She looks at it, blankly, then takes it.)</p>
            <p>(Joe walks over to the table by the front door, pouring a drink 
              into a glass from a bottle, and swallowing it.)</p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(just putting down her last glove)</p>
            <p>May I have some? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(firmly)</p>
            <p>No. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Puts his glass down, going over to her)</p>
            <p>Now look--. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(shaking her head)</p>
            <p>This is very unusual. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Unbuttoning her cuffs, then the bottom button of her blouse)</p>
            <p>I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              (Pulling up her blouse out of her skirt)</p>
            <p>With my dress off it's most unusual. </p>
            <p><br>
              (With a half-laugh)</p>
            <p>Hm, I don't seem to mind. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Smiling at him as she starts to open the remaining buttons)</p>
            <p>Do you? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>(amused)</p>
            <p>Hm. </p>

              JOE</p>
            <p>(pulling out a pillow from the bed)</p>
            <p>You'd better get to sleep. </p>

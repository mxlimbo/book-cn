            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Irving... I, I don't know just how to tell you this, but--. </p>

              IRVING</p>
            <p>Wait till I sit down </p>

            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Well, in regard to the story that goes with these: there is no 
              story. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(pausing)</p>
            <p>W-why not? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(walking away to pour another drink)</p>
            <p>I mean not as far as I'm concerned. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(he looks at Joe and, understanding, pauses for a moment)</p>
            <p>Er, well, the er, pictures came out pretty well. You wanna have 
              a look at 'em? </p>
            <p><br>
              (he goes to the bed, spreading the pictures out. He holds one up 
              to Joe as he comes over)</p>
            <p>Huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Enthusiastically; as Joe takes it, smiling)</p>
            <p>How about a blow-up from a negative that size, huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(laughing)</p>
            <p>Yeah. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe picks some pictures up)</p>
            <p>Ha, that's her first cigarette, huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, at Rocca's. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Joe displays the next one)</p>
            <p>Hey, the Mouth of Truth. </p>
            <p><br>
              (looking at the next one they laugh. It's of Ann and Mario, dancing)</p>
            <p>Oh, you wanna know the caption I had in mind, there? 'Barber cuts 
              in'--huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(taking another from the bed)</p>
            <p>Well, here's the one I figured would be the key shot for the whole 
              layout: </p>
            <p><br>
              (the picture is of Ann looking at the plaques)</p>
            <p>'The Wall Where Wishes Come True', hmm? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Joe, that's good. Lead off with that then follow up on the wishes? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(he picks up another one)</p>
            <p>I dug that up out of a file: 'Princess Inspects Police'. </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah, but--. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(handing him the next one, of Ann in custody after the scooter 
              ride)</p>
            <p>'Police Inspects Princess'. Huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              (They laugh)</p>
            <p>How about that? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Laughing)</p>
            <p>Pretty good, pretty good. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Irving hands him the next one: of Ann smashing the Secret Service 
              man over the head with the guitar)</p>
            <p>(Wow!)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Is that a shot? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(What a picture!)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Is that a shot, Joe? 'Body Guard Gets Body Blow'! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah. No, no, how 'bout this: 'Crowned Head'--huh? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Oh, I get it-- That-- Joe, you got--</p>
            <p>(Joe face loses its humour and Irving's enthusiasm fades.)</p>
            <p>She's fair game, Joe. It's always open season on princesses. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Shaking his shoulder)</p>
            <p>You must be out of your mind! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know but, er, look I can't prevent you from selling the 
              pictures if you want to. You'll get a good price for 'em. </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Yeah! </p>
            <p><br>
              (he bends over the bed to gather the pictures up.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>You going to the interview? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>You goin'? </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>Yeah. Well, it's an assignment, isn't it? </p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>Yeah. </p>
            <p><br>
              (Irving closes the envelope, noticing his soaking pants. He lifts 
              them off his wet leg, looking at Joe, annoyed. He goes out the door, 
              talking back to Joe, disappointed)</p>
            <p>I'll see you. </p>
            <p>(Joe stands and watches him leave.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(The huge Embassy hall. The floor teams with journalists and photographers, 
              milling around. Joe and Irving enter, standing at the entrance.)</p>
            <p><br>
              IRVING</p>
            <p>(looking up at the incredible ornation in the building)</p>
            <p>It ain't much, but it's home. </p>
            <p>(They walk into the crowd. A man approaches at the front of the 
              room, on top of the landing and walks to right of the ornate chair 
              sat in the centre. Several steps lead up to the landing from the 
              floor and are carpeted down the centre. Standing motionless at the 
              top of the steps the man claps twice, loudly.)</p>
            <p><br>
              EMBASSY ANNOUNCER</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen: please approach. </p>
            <p>(The crowd moves forward, pressing to the front behind the rope 
              that marks the boundary. Joe and Irving move to the front, towards 
              the right side of the gathering. The Master of Ceremonies approaches 
              from the back also, walking to the other side of the first man, 
              standing still. The Master of Ceremonies announces, in Italian, 
              &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;, then again in English. He then stands 
              sideways and waits.)</p>
            <p>(In a moment, the Princess emerges accompanied by the Ambassador, 
              the Countess, the General, and many others behind. Joe smiles slightly 
              as she approaches. Princess Ann stands in front of the chair.)</p>
            <p><br>
              AMBASSADOR</p>
            <p>Your Royal Highness: the ladies and gentlemen of the Press </p>
            <p><br>
              (he motions with his hand.)</p>
            <p>(Princess Ann turns to the gathering, raising and lowering her 
              head in acknowledgement to them. As she looks over them her eyes 
              fall on Joe and she starts just slightly, her expression hardening 
              a little. She looks down as the Ambassador motions to the chair 
              with his hand. She sits back gracefully, looking back up at Joe. 
              They exchange looks. Ann turns her head, nodding to the Master of 
              Ceremonies.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>(he bows, then turns to the group)</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen: Her Royal Highness will now answer your questions. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              CHIEF OF CORRESPONDENTS</p>
            <p>(standing in the crowd of journalists; speaking slowly, formally)</p>
            <p>I believe at the outset, Your Highness, that I should express the 
              pleasure of all of us at your recovery from the recent illness. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Thank you. </p>
            <p><br>
              AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT</p>
            <p>(speaking from the crowd)</p>
            <p>Does Your Highness believe that Federation would be a possible 
              solution to Europe's economic problems? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I am in favour of any measure which would lead to closer cooperation 
              in Europe. </p>
            <p><br>
              CORRESPONDENT</p>
            <p>And what, in the opinion of Your Highness, is the outlook for Friendship 
              Among Nations? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>I have every faith in it--</p>
            <p>(pausing; turning to look at Joe)</p>
            <p>as I have faith in relations between people </p>
            <p><br>
              (the people on the stage around her look about, slightly baffled; 
              the press gathering stirs slightly.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>May I say (speaking from my own press service) we believe that 
              Your Highness's faith will not be unjustified. </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(looking at Joe; smiling very slightly to him)</p>
            <p>I am so glad to hear you say it. </p>
            <p><br>
              CORRESPONDENT</p>
            <p>Which of the cities visited did Your Highness enjoy the most? </p>
            <p>(Ann pauses as she looks at Joe.)</p>
            <p><br>
              GENERAL</p>
            <p>(quietly, prompting her)</p>
            <p>Each in its own way... </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>Each in its own way was...unforgettable. It would be difficult 
              to--</p>
            <p>(she stops, then her face softens.)</p>
            <p>Rome; by all means, Rome. </p>
            <p><br>
              (The press stirs, muttering to themselves quietly. She turns to 
              look at Joe)</p>
            <p>I will cherish my visit here, in memory, as long as I live. </p>
            <p><br>
              CORRESPONDENT</p>
            <p>Despite your indisposition, Your Highness? </p>
            <p><br>
              ANN</p>
            <p>(turning to the correspondent)</p>
            <p>Despite that. </p>
            <p><br>
              MASTER OF CEREMONIES</p>
            <p>Photographs may now be taken. </p>
            <p>(The photographers swarm out from both sides from under the rope, 
              jostling before the steps as they photograph her. Princess Ann stands 
              up for them, stepping forward.)</p>
            <p>(As the photographers finish, Irving steps up, smiling to Ann as 
              he holds his small cigaretter lighter camera. He bends forward, 
              looking into it, as Ann smiles at him from above. Her expression 
              turns to astonishment when she realises what is it that he is using 
              as a camera. Irving smiles at her and Ann looks over at Joe who 
              also smiles back. The last of the photographers retreats behind 
              the rope. Irving rejoins Joe behind the rope.)</p>
            <p><br>
              GENERAL</p>
            <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. </p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>(to the Ambassador, who is slightly taken aback)</p>
            <p>I would now like to meet some of the ladies and gentlemen of the 
              Press. </p>
            <p>(Ann walks down the steps, stopping as the Countess and the General 
              walk down to accompany her. When they stop, she continues, walking 
              down the steps and to the left of the gathering, smiling as she 
              walks to up to the journalists.)</p>

            <p>(Reaching the last of the front-row journalists, Ann turns and 
              walks slowly up the steps. The press gathering applauds her warmly 
              as she reaches the top, her back to them. Slowly, she turns to face 
              them, smiling broadly to the the gathering as she looks over them. 
              Inevitably, her eyes fall to Joe. He smiles back, then her expression 
              grows sorrowful. She manages another slight smile then turns away 
              from them, and walks slowly and gracefully towards the exit. The 
              officials step aside for her to pass and then file after her through 
              the door.)</p>
            <p>(As she leaves, Joe watches her solemnly, the press turning to 
              leave also. Before turning to go himself, Irving looks to Joe, but 
              seeing his gaze unmoved walks away with the rest of them.)</p>
            <p>(The press, bustling and chattering behind him leave Joe alone, 
              standing at the rope, looking at the empty spot where the Princess 
              was last.)</p>
            <p>(Finally, Joe turns slowly to leave as the crowd disappears out 
              of the entrance to the building. Alone but for the guards lining 
              the room he walks slowly to the exit; hands in pockets, leaving 
              the stage behind him; the huge room silent except for his slow footsteps.)</p>
            <p>(Stopping near the entrance, he pauses for a moment to look down 
              the long hall back at the empty stage. Then, he turns and walks 
              away.)</p>

            <p>　　专辑中的许多歌曲其实都只有一段歌词，它在歌中一遍、两遍、三编甚至更多遍地重复着，使得 Nirvana 早期作品蒙上了一种警句般的光彩。“Blew”晦暗的音调同着首歌关于心灵被俘与受控的主题呼应的天衣无缝。“About 
              A Girl”流畅动听是 Cobain 内心一直存在的流行化倾向的挣扎，它在整张专辑里象一个不速之客，以一种莫名的优美孤寂地守侯忧伤的恋情。它也是 
              Cobain 往后创作倾向和人生创伤的最早艺术昭示。“School”清楚地反映了 Cobain 对西雅图音乐圈子的鄙夷心情。“Swap 
              Meet”是 Cobain 在 Aberdeen 经历的最好见证，使 Cobain 永远保持了一份对贫穷的畏惧，但也让他懂得了底层的艰辛。“Downer”是 
              Cobain 写得很早的一首歌，也是他作品中少有的直接表达政治意识的作品，其中包括典型的朋可政见，既有达达主义般的狂躁，也有赤子似的天真，更多的则是莫名的混乱。

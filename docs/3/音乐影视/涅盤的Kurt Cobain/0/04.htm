              1992年出版 <br>
              　　《INCESTICIDE》并不是一张完整设计的专辑，但它充分展示了 Cobain 和乐队的种种极端甚至矛盾的方面。“Dive”是从乐队的小样上扒下来的。“Sliver”是与 
              Cobain 身世有关的歌。专辑中还翻唱了三首歌曲，即 Devo 乐队的“Turnaround”和 The Vaseline 乐队的“Molly's 
              Lips”及“Son Of Gun”。“Beeswax”、“Mexican Seafood”、“Hairspray Queen”和“Aero 
              Zeppelin”显然是1988年1月 Nirvana 第一盘录音小样中的版本，这几首歌都是 Cobain 最早的一些作品。“Big 
              Long Now”这首歌是 Cobain 和 Chris 共同写的曲子。专辑的封面画是 Cobain 的作品。一个经受创伤的孩子正在爬上父母摸样的骨架人体，后者显然不愿搭理那个孩子，于是孩子充满渴望的目光投向了一束花，而那赫然便是美丽而致命的罂粟花，这幅画令人惊心动魄地看到了 
              Cobain 一代人的经历。 </p>

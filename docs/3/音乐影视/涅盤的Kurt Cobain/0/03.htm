            <p> 　　“Smells Like Teen Spirit”集美妙旋律和狂暴情绪为一体，这首歌中最为人注目的特点是不把一切归咎于上一代人，它直言不讳地指出了自身的缺陷。这同样也是列侬的特质，既自由而潇洒地谈论和描述自己的困惑和梦想，毫无畏惧、毫无拘束。如果 
              Cobain 不曾写下这首歌，他的传奇和他艺术的成就就会打点折扣，因为正是这首歌，成为了所有对现代社会的异化感同身受的青年的共同呐喊，成了全世界那些精神上似乎是无法得到满足的人们得到无限满足的欢叫，成了一切在残酷现实面前梦想破灭者的呻吟，成了依然保持最后理想者疲于奔命时的狂野呼告。“Polly 
              ”是以一个1987年发生的真实故事为基础写成的，Cobain 十分痛恨对女性的不公和不恭，他总是为他这一代人里也有歧视和蹂躏女性的人感到惭愧。“Something 
              In Way”是 Cobain 在 Aberdeen 桥下凄凉经历的记录，他奇特的视角既让人忍俊不禁，又让人毛骨悚然，而这就是 
              Kurt・Cobain 。专辑的封面照片也为专辑增色不少，也成为媒体和听众注目的焦点，关于这幅封面照片的含义，也是众说纷纭。 </p>

              UTERO》:1993年出版<br>
              　　这张专辑是 Nirvana作的一张Lo-Fi 专辑，专辑中的音乐的确也反映了Cobain 生活中的阴暗面，在专辑《Nevernmind》中已经初露端倪的狂躁抑郁症被发展到了极点。“Serve 
              The Servants”涉及了 Covain 生活中的各个方面。“Scentless Apprentice”是乐队三人共同作曲的歌之一，是乐队一种新创作心态的标志。“Rape 
              Me”是《In Utero》专辑里最早写成的歌，它针对的并不仅仅是“强暴”，而是一种内心的创伤。“Frances Farmer 
              Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle”是 Cobain 献给他心目中的圣女和殉道先烈 Frances 
              Farmer 的颂歌。“Milk It”是 Nirvana 在《Nevernmind》之后改变方向的标志性作品之一。从一首首歌上看，《In 
              Utero》似乎缺少“Smells Like Teen Spirit”那种一呼天下应的扛鼎之作，但是真正让 Nirvana 向前跨出一大步的正是《In 
              Utero》，它更具真正的非主流气质，也更具对主流音乐的颠覆性。 </p>

              And the animals I've trapped <br>
              Have all become my pets <br>

              Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand <br>
              To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands <br>

              And an illustrated book about birds <br>

              Who needs action when you got words <br>
              When you've finished with the mop then you can stop <br>
              And look at what you've done <br>
              The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen <br>
              And the work it took was fun <br>
              Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau <br>
              Some said it was in Greenland and some in Mexico <br>
              Some decided it was nowhere except for where they stood <br>

<p>　　The first edition is important to new editor Tara a
nd her team.</p>

<p>　　We've got rubber duckies, we got… we got everything
, things that women use. It's got to be a Women's Weekl
y thing.Hopefully, I' ll help establish that voice, whi
ch is, you know, my voice.We like the energy that every
one is performing, is giving their best. You know, but 
it's very tough.What's the deadline now?Friday, today i
s Wednesday.</p>

<p>　　(title: WOMEN IN THE PRESS)</p>

<p>　　Julie: Did you save it?Bee Yoon: I think I did. I h
ope I did. May be we didn't save it.Julie: We didn't sa
ve it.</p>

<p>　　Bee Yoon's two graphic artists are already putting 
in long hours designing each page. And they're still wa
iting for the key story, an interview with the very pri
vate Tina Tan Leo.</p>

<p>　　Tara: We're taking direction from our editor in chi
ef. The final story, it's going to make this issue. And
I'm sorry about this, May. I know you hate me, but what
can I say? It's a Versace story.May: You know when's th
e deadline?Julie: Friday.May: Yes.May: Hell, hell.Tara:
It is hell, yes.Julie: Go for it. Go, go, go! Get out, 
get out!Tara: Chain yourself to that computer.</p>

<p>　　May: the time is really short of time, and there ar
e only two of us. We've got to work really late for mos
t of the… we've got to move in. I guess, to stay here. 
We'll be working'til twelve midnight every night.(Julie
on phone)So will she do it? Did she say yes or now? Cut
to the chase. Tell me the truth.</p>

<p>　　Julie's been in Singapore a lot longer that Tara.Sh
e has good contacts, and she works hard in pursuit of T
ina and the Versace story.</p>

<p>　　Can I come and convince her? Can I come and convinc
e her?Puh-leese? Yeah. Oh, that'll be great. Just tell 
her…I mean, you know. I can come down whenever.</p>

<p>　　〖interview〗Q: How important is it to get her?A: At 
this stage, it's really important, because we need a gl
amour element. I mean, we can actually do something, pu
t something together, but to have that personal touch o
f someone with this kind of, um, image in Singapore wou
ld be quite…it'd be good for the magazine. Um, if not, 
we'll fall back on Plan B.Q: which is?A: We don't know 
yet.</p>

<p>　　〖words: the Publisher arrives〗</p>

<p>　　Q: So what are you expecting to see tomorrow?Richar
d: It's at this stage just keeping on getting a sense o
f how she's going, and, what level of confidence she ha
s in the recipe she's brewed up.Of course, the ultimate
test is sales and the reaction of readers, which we won
't have for a few weeks more.</p>

<p>　　Tara: Yeah, Gong Li. I chose the most elusive woman
in the world for the first cover.Richard: Yes, yes.I li
ke the pose, actually.Tara: she's um, she's very well k
nown. She has a very high recall factor for, um, women.
Richard: Great. Great. I'm sorry… so you've got ads, yo
u've got contents, you've got… Versace?Tara and Julie: 
Ah…Julie: Aha. That will be there. That's our deadline 
story, so…Richard: When is final send off? Tomorrow? Is
that why May's here? She won't go home until it's finis
hed?Tara: Well, we've been staying'til about one or two
.Tara: this Versace story is important.R: Yeah, yeah, o
f course.Tara: so, you know, we just have to have a bit
of courage.R: I an see, even I…I may not have edited a 
magazine for the last three months, but even I can tell
there are other pages that are still…it's not entirely 
waiting for the Versace story.Tara: No.</p>

<p>　　〖words: the following day〗</p>

<p>　　Julie: Hello? Yeah, hi. How are you? Are you out of
breath? Oh, fantastic. That's really what I wanted to k
now. So, um, that's wonderful. Yeah. Now what's the con
ditions?</p>

<p>　　Julie's connections to Tina Tan Leo and the Versace
story finally pay off.</p>

<p>　　Julie: That would be fantastic…oh God! Alphonsos, I
love you. You understand this?Julie: yes! Well, I'm hap
py.</p>

<p>　　〖interview〗May: We'll be finished very soon. Still 
got about six more stories to go.Q: What's the deadline
now?May: It's over.</p>

<p>　　〖studio〗(voice over)…How a Versace masterpiece can 
raise twenty thousand for the Cancer Society, and…Free 
gift inside.Julie: I mean, she doesn't have to be havin
g an orgasm or anything. It's not that good.Engineer: P
eople have been known to have orgasms with those free g
ifts. Let's go…for some, ah, some wild free gifts. Why 
don't we just do three in a row?Woman: What is the free
gift?Julie: It's a bag tidy. What's a bag tidy? Trust m
e, you'll love it.Woman: and… and free gift inside. And
free gift inside. An free gift inside.</p>

<p>　　Julie: Free gift inside! Free gift inside!</p>

<p>　　〖words: four days after the deadline〗(Radio:…and he
r friend Dodi El Fayad. They were driven across Paris. 
Several of them are in custody for questioning…)Tara: I
t's really sad. Anyway. It's just really sad, you know?
I don't… I don't even know the woman, but I feel really
sad. But, you know, from a professional point of view, 
we've got four pages of her in the magazine. There's a 
lovely story all about her style and her fashion sense…
which of course isn't really relevant anymore, so…we ha
ve to do a story really quickly. I also have to try and
make sure that no one freaks out there because this is 
possible to do in the time.</p>

<p>　　Tara: Yeah, basically. Yeah. Yeah, they are. Thanks
. Look at that. That's a great picture. We need to yank
hold of those two spreads. And we need to change the co
ver. The cover, we've got Princess Di. Yes."Is she hunt
ing for a Singapore husband."…and the answer now is now
. so I think we'll just have an exclusive tribute. Some
thing like that.</p>

<p>　　Julie: Obviously we knew we'd have to change one of
the stories in the magazine, um, and I think the diffic
ulty bit will be now getting pictures, making sure we c
an get our hands on some photographs and get them in he
re. Some more appropriate photographs other than… becau
se we had a story concentrating more on her fashion sen
se, and her, looking for a new husband. I mean, it was 
a bit inappropriate, really.</p>

<p>　　Julie: Aha!Bee Yoon: What do you think?Julie: I can
't believe we did it.Julie: Excuse me. We need to have 
a group hug here.</p>

<p>　　Tara: I can't believe it.Assistant: Well look insid
e.Tara: Yes, sorry. Just mesmerized by the gloss.</p>

<p>　　Woman: I'll have to buy it!Woman2: oh, this is real
ly perfect.</p>

<p>　　Jamie: That's very colorful.Tara: I can't believe i
t. You know? From nothing, form an empty desk.Jamie: It
's your baby.Tara: I know. And you can tell from the sh
ape of it what it was like to give birth.Jamie: And do 
you know what the great news is? You've only got to do 
one of these a month.Tara: oh, easily.</p>

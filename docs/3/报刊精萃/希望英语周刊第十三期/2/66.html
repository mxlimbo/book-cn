<p>　　Rebecca( R) Bill( B) Tony( T) Ann( A)</p>

<p>　　R: Hi. Here at‘Let’s Talk’ today, we’re talking abo
ut‘Mother's Day’ and‘Father's Day’, which are two big n
ational holidays in many Western countries. And actuall
y it’s interesting because it’s not the same holiday in
every country I believe the origin of Mother's Day bega
n in England. And we’re lucky today that we have Ann an
d Tony here, who are English and they can tell us a lit
tle bit about Mother's Day in England, which is not the
same as in my country, the U.S. So you don’t even call 
it Mother's Day. What do you call it?</p>

<p>　　A: No that's right. We call it‘Mothering Sunday’, b
ecause it's always on a Sunday. I don't really know the
origin of it but my memory is of always making sure my 
mother had a cup of tea early in the morning. And then 
we would go to church. And at the end of the church ser
vice, the children would collect a daffodil from the vi
car and take it back and give it to our mother who woul
d normally be sitting in the service in the church. And
really that’s all we did to celebrate the day.</p>

<p>　　R: It interesting that you’ve remembered specifical
ly a daffodil. It's always in springtime. So that make 
sense.</p>

<p>　　A: It’s very special. A daffodil in springtime.</p>

<p>　　R: I think often children think of a cup of tea or 
a special breakfast, and I think a lot of memories are 
centered around the special morning for your mother. I 
remember making a little craft item at school about a w
eek before. And usually I gave them to my mother. She s
till has a drawer full of them of my bad crafts and orn
aments and things that I made her. What about you? Do y
ou have any memories of Mother's Day as a dutiful son?</p>

<p>　　T: Yes. As Ann said, taking cups of tea to my mothe
r. Perhaps making sure that she didn’t have to do any h
ousework that particular day. It meant perhaps she had 
to do twice as much the next day. But the idea in gener
al is that the washing-up would be done, perhaps some c
ooking would be done. Trying to relieve her of all thos
e jobs to make a special day for her, So that whenever 
she looked around there was something to eat, something
to drink, or something to read, or something interestin
g for her to do.</p>

<p>　　R: Oh. That’s sound wonderful. I don't think my chi
ldren would think of washing dishes for me. It’s possib
le, but that's a really nice way of celebrating. And I 
remember the flower thing at church once because I was 
pregnant and expecting a baby. I wasn’t a mother yet. A
nd my husband and I were at church and at the end of th
e service they give every mother a rose. I wasn’t used 
to being a mother yet. It hadn't happened, but they cam
e and they give me a rose too. That made me realize tha
t‘Oh. I will be a mother.’ So I have never forgotten th
at Mother's Day and that was very special.</p>

<p>　　R: What about the Father's Day, Bill? Do you still 
remember any special about the Father's Day when you we
re a little boy? And doing something for your dad?</p>

<p>　　(Listening Comprehension)B: Father's Day is always 
in June, a Sunday in the middle of June. And it was alw
ays near my birthday. So it sort of crept down up on al
l of us, and we would be surprised, there it would be F
ather's Day and we would generally do something with ou
r father. Whereas I think on Mother's Day the family tr
ies to keep the mother from having to do too much work.
On Father's Day, the idea is to find something fun that
the children do with their father together. So I rememb
er going to baseball games. Or I can remember when we g
ot older my father would like us all to do golfing with
him. I think that on Father's Day it’s particularly foc
used on doing things together because that is supposed 
to be relaxing and fun for Dad.</p>

<p>　　R: What about now? What’s the best way of celebrati
ng Father's Day with your own kids.</p>

<p>　　B: Well right now, I get the most enjoyment out of 
them making a card or doing something special for me. I
really appreciate that they spent the time and they wer
e excited and planned it and gave it to me. That’s mean
s a lot. And what's most special was if we could then d
o something together, or spend time together. So I see 
now that time devoted just to being together is really 
what Father's Day, and sort of Mother's Day, is all abo
ut. Taking the time to show appreciation to your father
or your mother.(End of Listening Comprehension)</p>

<p>　　R: It’s hard for us being overseas because our pare
nts and children are sometimes far away. And I brought 
a card since we’re discussing it today, But we always p
repare photos and card to send back to our family. We h
ave mothers and grandmothers still living. You expect y
our children who living far away to send something, wou
ldn’t you? Hopefully?</p>

<p>　　T: Yes, we always hope.</p>

<p>　　R: And just to recap all around the world in many W
estern Countries, Mother's Day and Father's Day are cel
ebrated. In England and British countries, Mothering Su
nday is in March. In the U.S. and Germany and other cou
ntries, it’s one Sunday in May. And Father's Day is in 
the middle of June. How do you celebrate a Mother's Day
or Father's Day? Do you celebrate a special birthday fo
r your mother or you grandmother, or for your Dad? Mayb
e Women’s Day. Write us a letter. And tell us ways you 
would suggest that all of us should celebrate and honor
and respect our mothers and fathers. We’ll be ready to 
hear your ideas. Thanks for all your letters!</p>

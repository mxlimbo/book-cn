              <p><b>　　IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO 
                BE MET WITH ON AMERICAN RAILROADS </b></p>
              <p>　　 The train pursued its course, that evening, without interruption, 
                passing Fort Saunders, crossing Cheyne Pass, and reaching Evans 
                Pass. The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, 
                eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea. 
                The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless 
                plains, levelled by nature. A branch of the &quot;grand trunk&quot; 
                led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado. The country 
                round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than fifty thousand 
                inhabitants are already settled there. </p>
              <p>　　Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over 
                from San Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days 
                and nights more would probably bring them to New York. Phileas 
                Fogg was not as yet behind-hand. </p>
              <p>　　During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge 
                Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between 
                the territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska 
                at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on 
                the southern branch of the Platte River. </p>
              <p>　　It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated 
                on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. 
                Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, 
                amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, 
                stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees 
                performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, 
                and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press 
                brought on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of 
                this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, 
                thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities 
                and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of the locomotive, 
                more powerful than Amphion's lyre, was about to bid them rise 
                from American soil. </p>
              <p>　　Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and 
                three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before 
                reaching Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the 
                southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine 
                the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built 
                between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around 
                it and form a single artery a large tributary whose waters empty 
                into the Missouri a little above Omaha. </p>
              <p>　　The one hundred and first meridian was passed. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not 
                even the dummy-- complained of the length of the trip. Fix had 
                begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; 
                but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg. 
                During the morning, chance distinctly favoured that gentleman. 
                Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands. </p>
              <p>　　Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point 
                of playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, &quot;I should 
                play a diamond.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel 
                Proctor. </p>
              <p>　　Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah! it's you, is it, Englishman?&quot; cried the colonel; 
                &quot;it's you who are going to play a spade!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And who plays it,&quot; replied Phileas Fogg coolly, 
                throwing down the ten of spades. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds,&quot; replied 
                Colonel Proctor, in an insolent tone. </p>
              <p>　　He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been 
                played, adding, &quot;You don't understand anything about whist.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Perhaps I do, as well as another,&quot; said Phileas 
                Fogg, rising. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You have only to try, son of John Bull,&quot; replied 
                the colonel. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold. She seized Mr. Fogg's 
                arm and gently pulled him back. Passepartout was ready to pounce 
                upon the American, who was staring insolently at his opponent. 
                But Fix got up, and, going to Colonel Proctor said, &quot;You 
                forget that it is I with whom you have to deal, sir; for it was 
                I whom you not only insulted, but struck!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fix,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, &quot;pardon me, but this 
                affair is mine, and mine only. The colonel has again insulted 
                me, by insisting that I should not play a spade, and he shall 
                give me satisfaction for it.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;When and where you will,&quot; replied the American, 
                &quot;and with whatever weapon you choose.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg; as vainly did the 
                detective endeavour to make the quarrel his. Passepartout wished 
                to throw the colonel out of the window, but a sign from his master 
                checked him. Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American followed 
                him upon the platform. &quot;Sir,&quot; said Mr. Fogg to his adversary, 
                &quot;I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe, and any delay 
                whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, what's that to me?&quot; replied Colonel Proctor. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sir,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, very politely, &quot;after 
                our meeting at San Francisco, I determined to return to America 
                and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called 
                me to England.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Really!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why not ten years hence?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I say six months,&quot; returned Phileas Fogg; &quot;and 
                I shall be at the place of meeting promptly.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;All this is an evasion,&quot; cried Stamp Proctor. &quot;Now 
                or never!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very good. You are going to New York?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To Chicago?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To Omaha?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What difference is it to you? Do you know Plum Creek?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's the next station. The train will be there in an 
                hour, and will stop there ten minutes. In ten minutes several 
                revolver-shots could be exchanged.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; said Mr. Fogg. &quot;I will stop at 
                Plum Creek.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And I guess you'll stay there too,&quot; added the American 
                insolently. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Who knows?&quot; replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car 
                as coolly as usual. He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that 
                blusterers were never to be feared, and begged Fix to be his second 
                at the approaching duel, a request which the detective could not 
                refuse. Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness. 
              </p>
              <p>　　At eleven o'clock the locomotive's whistle announced that they 
                were approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed 
                by Fix, went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him, 
                carrying a pair of revolvers. Aouda remained in the car, as pale 
                as death. </p>
              <p>　　The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared 
                on the platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his 
                second. But just as the combatants were about to step from the 
                train, the conductor hurried up, and shouted, &quot;You can't 
                get off, gentlemen!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot; asked the colonel. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am sorry,&quot; said the conductor; &quot;but we shall 
                be off at once. There's the bell ringing now.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The train started. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I'm really very sorry, gentlemen,&quot; said the conductor. 
                &quot;Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to 
                oblige you. But, after all, as you have not had time to fight 
                here, why not fight as we go along? </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,&quot; 
                said the colonel, in a jeering tone. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It would be perfectly so,&quot; replied Phileas Fogg. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, we are really in America,&quot; thought Passepartout, 
                &quot;and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　So muttering, he followed his master. </p>
              <p>　　The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed 
                through the cars to the rear of the train. The last car was only 
                occupied by a dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked 
                if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, 
                as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle. The passengers 
                granted the request with alacrity, and straightway disappeared 
                on the platform. </p>
              <p>　　The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient 
                for their purpose. The adversaries might march on each other in 
                the aisle, and fire at their ease. Never was duel more easily 
                arranged. Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each provided with two 
                six-barrelled revolvers, entered the car. The seconds, remaining 
                outside, shut them in. They were to begin firing at the first 
                whistle of the locomotive. After an interval of two minutes, what 
                remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car. </p>
              <p>　　Nothing could be more simple. Indeed, it was all so simple 
                that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they 
                would crack. They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, 
                when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air, accompanied by 
                reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists 
                were. The reports continued in front and the whole length of the 
                train. Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted 
                their prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous. 
                They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux. 
              </p>
              <p>　　This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for 
                more than once they had waylaid trains on the road. A hundred 
                of them had, according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without 
                stopping the train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse 
                at full gallop. </p>
              <p>　　The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, 
                to which the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded 
                by revolver-shots. </p>
              <p>　　The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned 
                the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets. A Sioux 
                chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work 
                the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, 
                and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like 
                enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and 
                fighting hand to hand with the passengers. Penetrating the baggage-car, 
                they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train. The cries 
                and shots were constant. The travellers defended themselves bravely; 
                some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like 
                moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Aouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself 
                like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the 
                broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty Sioux 
                had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed 
                those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms. Several 
                passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats. </p>
              <p>　　It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted 
                for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the 
                Sioux if the train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where 
                there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once 
                passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney 
                and the station beyond. </p>
              <p>　　The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot 
                and fell. At the same moment he cried, &quot;Unless the train 
                is stopped in five minutes, we are lost!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It shall be stopped,&quot; said Phileas Fogg, preparing 
                to rush from the car. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Stay, monsieur,&quot; cried Passepartout; &quot;I will 
                go.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening 
                a door unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under 
                the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed 
                across each other over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic 
                experience, and with amazing agility worked his way under the 
                cars, holding on to the chains, aiding himself by the brakes and 
                edges of the sashes, creeping from one car to another with marvellous 
                skill, and thus gaining the forward end of the train. </p>
              <p>　　There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the 
                tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing 
                to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the 
                yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out. 
                The train, now detached from the engine, remained a little behind, 
                whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed. </p>
              <p>　　Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved 
                for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they 
                stopped, less than a hundred feet from Kearney station. </p>
              <p>　　The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; 
                the Sioux had not expected them, and decamped in a body before 
                the train entirely stopped. </p>
              <p>　　But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform 
                several were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman, 
                whose devotion had just saved them.</p>

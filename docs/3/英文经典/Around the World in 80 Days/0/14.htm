              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DESCENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL 
                VALLEY OF THE GANGES WITHOUT EVER THINKING OF SEEING IT </b></p>
              <p>　　 The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout 
                laughed gaily at his success. Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow's 
                hand, and his master said, &quot;Well done!&quot; which, from 
                him, was high commendation; to which Passepartout replied that 
                all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg. As for him, 
                he had only been struck with a &quot;queer&quot; idea; and he 
                laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the 
                ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a charming 
                woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah! As for the young Indian woman, 
                she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, 
                wrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the 
                howdahs. </p>
              <p>　　The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, 
                was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, 
                an hour after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain. They 
                made a halt at seven o'clock, the young woman being still in a 
                state of complete prostration. The guide made her drink a little 
                brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her could 
                not yet be shaken off. Sir Francis, who was familiar with the 
                effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured 
                his companions on her account. But he was more disturbed at the 
                prospect of her future fate. He told Phileas Fogg that, should 
                Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the 
                hands of her executioners. These fanatics were scattered throughout 
                the county, and would, despite the English police, recover their 
                victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta. She would only be safe 
                by quitting India for ever. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock, and, 
                the interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them 
                to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Phileas Fogg 
                would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which 
                left Calcutta the next day, October 25th, at noon, for Hong Kong. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the 
                station, whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her 
                various articles of toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs; for 
                which his master gave him unlimited credit. Passepartout started 
                off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad, 
                that is, the City of God, one of the most venerated in India, 
                being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and 
                Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of 
                the peninsula. The Ganges, according to the legends of the Ramayana, 
                rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma's agency, it descends 
                to the earth. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to 
                take a good look at the city. It was formerly defended by a noble 
                fort, which has since become a state prison; its commerce has 
                dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such 
                a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street. At last he came 
                upon an elderly, crusty Jew, who sold second-hand articles, and 
                from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle, 
                and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to 
                pay seventy-five pounds. He then returned triumphantly to the 
                station. </p>
              <p>　　The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected 
                Aouda began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so 
                that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression. </p>
              <p>　　When the poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of the 
                queen of Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus: </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Her shining tresses, divided in two parts, encircle the 
                harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks, brilliant 
                in their glow and freshness. Her ebony brows have the form and 
                charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long 
                silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, 
                as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her 
                great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between 
                her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower's half-enveloped 
                breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little 
                feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy 
                of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds 
                of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp 
                around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty 
                of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of 
                its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems 
                to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, 
                the immortal sculptor.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody 
                to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation 
                of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide 
                had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed 
                by her bringing up. </p>
              <p>　　The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded 
                to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not 
                a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered 
                all that his master owed to the guide's devotion. He had, indeed, 
                risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should 
                be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty 
                escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed of. What 
                should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? 
                Phileas Fogg had already determined this question. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Parsee,&quot; said he to the guide, &quot;you have been 
                serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not 
                for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is 
                yours.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The guide's eyes glistened. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Your honour is giving me a fortune!&quot; cried he. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Take him, guide,&quot; returned Mr. Fogg, &quot;and I 
                shall still be your debtor.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good!&quot; exclaimed Passepartout. &quot;Take him, friend. 
                Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.&quot; And, going up to the 
                elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, &quot;Here, 
                Kiouni, here, here.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout 
                around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head. 
                Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which 
                replaced him gently on the ground. </p>
              <p>　　Soon after, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty, and Passepartout, 
                installed in a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were 
                whirling at full speed towards Benares. It was a run of eighty 
                miles, and was accomplished in two hours. During the journey, 
                the young woman fully recovered her senses. What was her astonishment 
                to find herself in this carriage, on the railway, dressed in European 
                habiliments, and with travellers who were quite strangers to her! 
                Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little 
                liquor, and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed, 
                dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated 
                to risk his life to save her, and recounting the happy sequel 
                of the venture, the result of Passepartout's rash idea. Mr. Fogg 
                said nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that 
                &quot;it wasn't worth telling.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears 
                than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than 
                her lips. Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the 
                sacrifice, and recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she 
                shuddered with terror. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda's mind, and 
                offered, in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong, 
                where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up--an 
                offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted. She had, it seems, 
                a Parsee relation, who was one of the principal merchants of Hong 
                Kong, which is wholly an English city, though on an island on 
                the Chinese coast. </p>
              <p>　　At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares. The Brahmin 
                legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient 
                Casi, which, like Mahomet's tomb, was once suspended between heaven 
                and earth; though the Benares of to-day, which the Orientalists 
                call the Athens of India, stands quite unpoetically on the solid 
                earth, Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay 
                huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as the train 
                entered it. </p>
              <p>　　Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's destination, the troops 
                he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city. 
                He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing 
                the hope that he would come that way again in a less original 
                but more profitable fashion. Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the 
                hand. The parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to 
                Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, he 
                received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the 
                valley of the Ganges. Through the windows of their carriage the 
                travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar, 
                with its mountains clothed in verdure, its fields of barley, wheat, 
                and corn, its jungles peopled with green alligators, its neat 
                villages, and its still thickly-leaved forests. Elephants were 
                bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, 
                despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly 
                their pious ablutions. These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest 
                foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, 
                the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme 
                ruler of priests and legislators. What would these divinities 
                think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with steamers whistling 
                and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float 
                upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the 
                faithful dwelling upon its borders? </p>
              <p>　　The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when 
                the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers 
                could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward 
                from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or 
                Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord 
                Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified 
                town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading-place, 
                where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, 
                a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester 
                or Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edgetool factories, and 
                high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward. </p>
              <p>　　Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst 
                of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before 
                the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, 
                Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French 
                town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud 
                to see his country's flag flying, were hidden from their view 
                in the darkness. </p>
              <p>　　Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet 
                left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours 
                before him. </p>
              <p>　　According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th 
                of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. 
                He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two 
                days gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been 
                seen, in the journey across India. But it is not to be supposed 
                that Phileas Fogg regretted them. </p>

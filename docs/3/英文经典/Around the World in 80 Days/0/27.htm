              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES, AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES 
                AN HOUR, A COURSE OF MORMON HISTORY </b></p>
              <p>　　 During the night of the 5th of December, the train ran south-easterly 
                for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly 
                direction, towards the Great Salt Lake. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform 
                to take the air. The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it 
                was not snowing. The sun's disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed 
                an enormous ring of gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself 
                by calculating its value in pounds sterling, when he was diverted 
                from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who 
                made his appearance on the platform. </p>
              <p>　　This personage, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and 
                dark, with black moustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, 
                a black waistcoat, black trousers, a white cravat, and dogskin 
                gloves. He might have been taken for a clergyman. He went from 
                one end of the train to the other, and affixed to the door of 
                each car a notice written in manuscript. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout approached and read one of these notices, which 
                stated that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage 
                of his presence on train No. 48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism 
                in car No. 117, from eleven to twelve o'clock; and that he invited 
                all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries 
                of the religion of the &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot; to attend. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Passepartout to himself. He knew 
                nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy, which is its 
                foundation. </p>
              <p>　　The news quickly spread through the train, which contained 
                about one hundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted 
                by the notice, ensconced themselves in car No. 117. Passepartout 
                took one of the front seats. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to 
                attend. </p>
              <p>　　At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an 
                irritated voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, 
                &quot;I tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother 
                Hiram is a martyr, and that the persecutions of the United States 
                Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham 
                Young. Who dares to say the contrary?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone 
                contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage. No doubt 
                his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually 
                subjected. The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, 
                in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule. It had made 
                itself master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws 
                of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion 
                and polygamy. The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled 
                their efforts, and resisted, by words at least, the authority 
                of Congress. Elder Hitch, as is seen, was trying to make proselytes 
                on the very railway trains. </p>
              <p>　　Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent 
                gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical 
                times: how that, in Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph 
                published the annals of the new religion, and bequeathed them 
                to his son Mormon; how, many centuries later, a translation of 
                this precious book, which was written in Egyptian, was made by 
                Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who revealed himself as 
                a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the celestial messenger 
                appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave him the annals 
                of the Lord. </p>
              <p>　　Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary's 
                narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his 
                lecture, related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, 
                and a few disciples, founded the church of the &quot;Latter Day 
                Saints,&quot; which, adopted not only in America, but in England, 
                Norway and Sweden, and Germany, counts many artisans, as well 
                as men engaged in the liberal professions, among its members; 
                how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple erected there at 
                a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town built at Kirkland; 
                how Smith became an enterprising banker, and received from a simple 
                mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several 
                famous Egyptians. </p>
              <p>　　The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience 
                grew gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers. 
                But this did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with 
                the story of Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined 
                creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance 
                some years afterwards, more honourable and honoured than ever, 
                at Independence, Missouri, the chief of a flourishing colony of 
                three thousand disciples, and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, 
                and retirement into the Far West. </p>
              <p>　　Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, 
                who was listening with all his ears. Thus he learned that, after 
                long persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded 
                a community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five 
                thousand souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief; 
                that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency 
                of the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade 
                at Carthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a 
                band of men disguised in masks. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the 
                Elder, looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years 
                after the assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, 
                Brigham Young, his successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the 
                Great Salt Lake, where, in the midst of that fertile region, directly 
                on the route of the emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to 
                California, the new colony, thanks to the polygamy practised by 
                the Mormons, had flourished beyond expectations. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And this,&quot; added Elder William Hitch, &quot;this 
                is why the jealousy of Congress has been aroused against us! Why 
                have the soldiers of the Union invaded the soil of Utah? Why has 
                Brigham Young, our chief, been imprisoned, in contempt of all 
                justice? Shall we yield to force? Never! Driven from Vermont, 
                driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio, driven from Missouri, 
                driven from Utah, we shall yet find some independent territory 
                on which to plant our tents. And you, my brother,&quot; continued 
                the Elder, fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor, &quot;will 
                you not plant yours there, too, under the shadow of our flag?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn 
                retiring from the car, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy. 
              </p>
              <p>　　During the lecture the train had been making good progress, 
                and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of 
                the Great Salt Lake. Thence the passengers could observe the vast 
                extent of this interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, 
                and into which flows an American Jordan. It is a picturesque expanse, 
                framed in lofty crags in large strata, encrusted with white salt-- 
                a superb sheet of water, which was formerly of larger extent than 
                now, its shores having encroached with the lapse of time, and 
                thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth. </p>
              <p>　　The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is 
                situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea. Quite different 
                from Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet 
                below the sea, it contains considerable salt, and one quarter 
                of the weight of its water is solid matter, its specific weight 
                being 1,170, and, after being distilled, 1,000. Fishes are, of 
                course, unable to live in it, and those which descend through 
                the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams soon perish. </p>
              <p>　　The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons 
                are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, 
                fields of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, 
                hedges of wild rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have 
                been seen six months later. Now the ground was covered with a 
                thin powdering of snow. </p>
              <p>　　The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for 
                six hours, Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt 
                Lake City, connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent 
                two hours in this strikingly American town, built on the pattern 
                of other cities of the Union, like a checker-board, &quot;with 
                the sombre sadness of right-angles,&quot; as Victor Hugo expresses 
                it. The founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from 
                the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons. In 
                this strange country, where the people are certainly not up to 
                the level of their institutions, everything is done &quot;squarely&quot;--cities, 
                houses, and follies. </p>
              <p>　　The travellers, then, were promenading, at three o'clock, about 
                the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan 
                and the spurs of the Wahsatch Range. They saw few or no churches, 
                but the prophet's mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick 
                houses with verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered 
                with acacias, palms, and locusts. A clay and pebble wall, built 
                in 1853, surrounded the town; and in the principal street were 
                the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions. The place 
                did not seem thickly populated. The streets were almost deserted, 
                except in the vicinity of the temple, which they only reached 
                after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades. 
                There were many women, which was easily accounted for by the &quot;peculiar 
                institution&quot; of the Mormons; but it must not be supposed 
                that all the Mormons are polygamists. They are free to marry or 
                not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly 
                the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as, according 
                to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the 
                possession of its highest joys. These poor creatures seemed to 
                be neither well off nor happy. Some--the more well-to-do, no doubt-- 
                wore short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; 
                others were habited in Indian fashion. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these 
                women, charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single 
                Mormon. His common sense pitied, above all, the husband. It seemed 
                to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once 
                across the vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, 
                in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them 
                in the company of the glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief 
                ornament of that delightful place, to all eternity. He felt decidedly 
                repelled from such a vocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was 
                mistaken-- that the fair ones of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming 
                glances on his person. Happily, his stay there was but brief. 
                At four the party found themselves again at the station, took 
                their places in the train, and the whistle sounded for starting. 
                Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels began 
                to move, cries of &quot;Stop! stop!&quot; were heard. </p>
              <p>　　Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one. The gentleman 
                who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon. He was breathless 
                with running. Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor 
                barriers. He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform 
                of the train, and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur 
                gymnast, approached him with lively interest, and learned that 
                he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene. </p>
              <p>　　When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured 
                to ask him politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner 
                in which he had decamped, it might be thought that he had twenty 
                at least. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;One, sir,&quot; replied the Mormon, raising his arms 
                heavenward --&quot;one, and that was enough!&quot; </p>

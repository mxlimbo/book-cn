              <p><b>　　IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF 
                POUNDS MORE </b></p>
              <p>　　 The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out 
                first, was followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion 
                to descend. Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong 
                Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the 
                voyage. He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on 
                dangerous ground. </p>
              <p>　　Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, 
                and said, &quot;Mr. Phileas Fogg?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am he.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is this man your servant?&quot; added the policeman, 
                pointing to Passepartout. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Be so good, both of you, as to follow me.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a 
                representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman. 
                Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman 
                tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;May this young lady go with us?&quot; asked he. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;She may,&quot; replied the policeman. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, 
                a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which 
                they took their places and were driven away. No one spoke during 
                the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination. 
                They first passed through the &quot;black town,&quot; with its 
                narrow streets, its miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; 
                then through the &quot;European town,&quot; which presented a 
                relief in its bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and 
                bristling with masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly 
                dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and 
                forth. </p>
              <p>　　The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, 
                however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion. The 
                policeman having requested his prisoners for so, truly, they might 
                be called-to descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, 
                and said: &quot;You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past 
                eight.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　He then retired, and closed the door. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why, we are prisoners!&quot; exclaimed Passepartout, 
                falling into a chair. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: 
                &quot;Sir, you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that 
                you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible. 
                It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing 
                a suttee. The complainants would not dare present themselves with 
                such a charge. There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, 
                in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But the steamer leaves at noon!&quot; observed Passepartout, 
                nervously. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;We shall be on board by noon,&quot; replied his master, 
                placidly. </p>
              <p>　　It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help 
                muttering to himself, &quot;Parbleu that's certain! Before noon 
                we shall be on board.&quot; But he was by no means reassured. 
              </p>
              <p>　　At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, 
                and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining 
                hall. It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans 
                and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench 
                opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately 
                after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, 
                entered. He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on 
                a nail, and put it hurriedly on his head. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The first case,&quot; said he. Then, putting his hand 
                to his head, he exclaimed, &quot;Heh! This is not my wig!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, your worship,&quot; returned the clerk, &quot;it 
                is mine.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence 
                in a clerk's wig?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The wigs were exchanged. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face 
                of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible 
                rapidity. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The first case,&quot; repeated Judge Obadiah. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Phileas Fogg?&quot; demanded Oysterpuff. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am here,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Passepartout?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Present,&quot; responded Passepartout. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good,&quot; said the judge. &quot;You have been looked 
                for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But of what are we accused?&quot; asked Passepartout, 
                impatiently. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are about to be informed.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am an English subject, sir,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, &quot;and 
                I have the right--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Have you been ill-treated?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Not at all.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very well; let the complainants come in.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian 
                priests entered. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That's it,&quot; muttered Passepartout; &quot;these are 
                the rogues who were going to burn our young lady.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the 
                clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege 
                against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having 
                violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You hear the charge?&quot; asked the judge. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, 
                &quot;and I admit it.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You admit it?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in 
                their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand 
                what was said. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; cried Passepartout, warmly; &quot;at the pagoda 
                of Pillaji, where they were on the point of burning their victim.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What victim?&quot; said Judge Obadiah. &quot;Burn whom? 
                In Bombay itself?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Bombay?&quot; cried Passepartout. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, 
                but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And as a proof,&quot; added the clerk, &quot;here are 
                the desecrator's very shoes, which he left behind him.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;My shoes!&quot; cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting 
                this imprudent exclamation to escape him. </p>
              <p>　　The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the 
                affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, 
                may be imagined. </p>
              <p>　　Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout's 
                escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, 
                had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English 
                authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, 
                he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward 
                to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the 
                rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian 
                capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having 
                been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. 
                Fix's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not 
                made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined. He made up his 
                mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken 
                refuge in the southern provinces. For twenty-four hours Fix watched 
                the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by 
                seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young 
                woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened 
                for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested 
                and brought before Judge Obadiah. </p>
              <p>　　Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have 
                espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, 
                watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for 
                the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done 
                at Bombay and Suez. </p>
              <p>　　Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash 
                exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world 
                to recall. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The facts are admitted?&quot; asked the judge. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Admitted,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg, coldly. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Inasmuch,&quot; resumed the judge, &quot;as the English 
                law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, 
                and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the 
                sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, 
                I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days 
                and a fine of three hundred pounds.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Three hundred pounds!&quot; cried Passepartout, startled 
                at the largeness of the sum. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Silence!&quot; shouted the constable. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And inasmuch,&quot; continued the judge, &quot;as it 
                is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the 
                master with the servant, and as the master in any case must be 
                held responsible for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas 
                Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty 
                pounds.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg 
                could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time 
                for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence 
                ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because 
                he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda! 
              </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in 
                the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it 
                was being pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, 
                he rose, and said, &quot;I offer bail.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You have that right,&quot; returned the judge. </p>
              <p>　　Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he 
                heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner 
                would be one thousand pounds. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will pay it at once,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, taking a 
                roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had 
                by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;This sum will be restored to you upon your release from 
                prison,&quot; said the judge. &quot;Meanwhile, you are liberated 
                on bail.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Come!&quot; said Phileas Fogg to his servant. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But let them at least give me back my shoes!&quot; cried 
                Passepartout angrily. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!&quot; he muttered, as 
                they were handed to him. &quot;More than a thousand pounds apiece; 
                besides, they pinch my feet.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed 
                by the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that 
                the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds 
                behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and 
                issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, 
                and the party were soon landed on one of the quays. </p>
              <p>　　The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its 
                signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o'clock was 
                striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them 
                leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and 
                stamped his feet with disappointment. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The rascal is off, after all!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Two 
                thousand pounds sacrificed! He's as prodigal as a thief! I'll 
                follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate 
                he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. 
                Since leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the 
                purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already 
                spent more than five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage 
                of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, 
                was rapidly diminishing.</p>

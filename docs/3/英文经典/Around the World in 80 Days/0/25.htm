              <p>　　IN WHICH A SLIGHT GLIMPSE IS HAD OF SAN FRANCISCO </p>
              <p>　　 It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout 
                set foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given 
                to the floating quay upon which they disembarked. These quays, 
                rising and falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading 
                and unloading of vessels. Alongside them were clippers of all 
                sizes, steamers of all nationalities, and the steamboats, with 
                several decks rising one above the other, which ply on the Sacramento 
                and its tributaries. There were also heaped up the products of 
                a commerce which extends to Mexico, Chili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, 
                Asia, and all the Pacific islands. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent, 
                thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in 
                fine style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell 
                through them. Put out of countenance by the manner in which he 
                thus &quot;set foot&quot; upon the New World, he uttered a loud 
                cry, which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans 
                that are always perched upon these movable quays, that they flew 
                noisily away. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what 
                hour the first train left for New York, and learned that this 
                was at six o'clock p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend 
                in the Californian capital. Taking a carriage at a charge of three 
                dollars, he and Aouda entered it, while Passepartout mounted the 
                box beside the driver, and they set out for the International 
                Hotel. </p>
              <p>　　From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity 
                the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon 
                Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick 
                warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and 
                upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese 
                and Indians. Passepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco 
                was no longer the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti, 
                assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds 
                in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled 
                with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the 
                other: it was now a great commercial emporium. </p>
              <p>　　The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama 
                of the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, 
                and in the midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, 
                while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported 
                from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts 
                and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk 
                hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously 
                active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some of the streets-- especially 
                Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco what Regent Street 
                is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris, and Broadway 
                to New York-- were lined with splendid and spacious stores, which 
                exposed in their windows the products of the entire world. </p>
              <p>　　When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not 
                seem to him as if he had left England at all. </p>
              <p>　　The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, 
                a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might 
                partake of dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without 
                taking out their purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, 
                or sherry which was drunk. This seemed &quot;very American&quot; 
                to Passepartout. The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable, 
                and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing themselves at a table, were 
                abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue. 
              </p>
              <p>　　After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for 
                the English consulate to have his passport visaed. As he was going 
                out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, 
                before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles 
                and Colt's revolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks 
                upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr. Fogg thought it 
                a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought best, and 
                went on to the consulate. </p>
              <p>　　He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, &quot;by 
                the greatest chance in the world,&quot; he met Fix. The detective 
                seemed wholly taken by surprise. What! Had Mr. Fogg and himself 
                crossed the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer! At least 
                Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he 
                owed so much, and, as his business recalled him to Europe, he 
                should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective-- 
                who was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission 
                to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco--a request 
                which Mr. Fogg readily granted. </p>
              <p>　　They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great 
                crowd was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the 
                shop-doors, the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were 
                full of people. Men were going about carrying large posters, and 
                flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries 
                were heard on every hand. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Hurrah for Camerfield!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Hurrah for Mandiboy!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who 
                said to Mr. Fogg, &quot;Perhaps we had better not mingle with 
                the crowd. There may be danger in it.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Mr. Fogg; &quot;and blows, even if 
                they are political are still blows.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see 
                without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the 
                top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery 
                Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between 
                a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been 
                erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd 
                seemed to be directed. </p>
              <p>　　For what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of 
                this excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it 
                to nominate some high official--a governor or member of Congress? 
                It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human 
                mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, 
                seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic 
                way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners 
                and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in 
                tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, 
                while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated 
                by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater 
                part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is evidently a meeting,&quot; said Fix, &quot;and 
                its object must be an exciting one. I should not wonder if it 
                were about the Alabama, despite the fact that that question is 
                settled.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Perhaps,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg, simply. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At least, there are two champions in presence of each 
                other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous 
                scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause 
                of it all was. Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; 
                hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners 
                began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in 
                every direction. Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages 
                and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd. Boots and 
                shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even 
                heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din, the rout approached 
                the stairway, and flowed over the lower step. One of the parties 
                had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not 
                tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It would be prudent for us to retire,&quot; said Fix, 
                who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at 
                least until they got back to London. &quot;If there is any question 
                about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would 
                go hard with us.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;An English subject--&quot; began Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose 
                on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and 
                there were frantic shouts of, &quot;Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, 
                hip, hurrah!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, 
                and taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and 
                Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. 
                The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. 
                Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to 
                protect their fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried 
                to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at 
                the end of every Englishman's arm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow 
                with a red beard, flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed 
                to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist to strike 
                Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not Fix 
                rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous bruise immediately 
                made its appearance under the detective's silk hat, which was 
                completely smashed in. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yankee!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous 
                look at the ruffian. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Englishman!&quot; returned the other. &quot;We will meet 
                again!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;When you please.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is your name?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Phileas Fogg. And yours?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Colonel Stamp Proctor.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily 
                got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily, 
                he was not seriously hurt. His travelling overcoat was divided 
                into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain 
                Indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on. 
                Aouda had escaped unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray 
                in his black and blue bruise. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon 
                as they were out of the crowd. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No thanks are necessary,&quot; replied. Fix; &quot;but 
                let us go.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Where?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To a tailor's.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Such a visit was, indeed, opportune. The clothing of both Mr. 
                Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively 
                engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour 
                after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned 
                to the International Hotel. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a 
                dozen six-barrelled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit 
                his brows; but Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their 
                adventure, his countenance resumed its placid expression. Fix 
                evidently was no longer an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully 
                keeping his word. </p>
              <p>　　Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and 
                their luggage to the station drew up to the door. As he was getting 
                in, Mr. Fogg said to Fix, &quot;You have not seen this Colonel 
                Proctor again?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will come back to America to find him,&quot; said Phileas 
                Fogg calmly. &quot;It would not be right for an Englishman to 
                permit himself to be treated in that way, without retaliating.&quot; 
                The detective smiled, but did not reply. It was clear that Mr. 
                Fogg was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate 
                duelling at home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked. 
              </p>
              <p>　　At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, 
                and found the train ready to depart. As he was about to enter 
                it, Mr. Fogg called a porter, and said to him: &quot;My friend, 
                was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It was a political meeting, sir,&quot; replied the porter. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in 
                the streets.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It was only a meeting assembled for an election.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?&quot; asked 
                Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, sir; of a justice of the peace.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full 
                speed.</p>

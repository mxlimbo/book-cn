              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS 
                MASTER, AND WHAT COMES OF IT </b></p>
              <p>　　Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the 
                English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the 
                colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important 
                city and an excellent port. The island is situated at the mouth 
                of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from 
                the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong 
                has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now 
                the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds 
                its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic 
                cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets, give to Hong 
                Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by 
                some strange magic to the antipodes. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards 
                the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins 
                and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, 
                and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong 
                seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, 
                like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. 
                At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all 
                nations: English, French, American, and Dutch, men-of-war and 
                trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and 
                flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres. Passepartout 
                noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old 
                and were dressed in yellow. On going into a barber's to get shaved 
                he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years 
                old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is 
                the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, 
                thought this very funny. </p>
              <p>　　On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, 
                he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective 
                seemed very much disturbed and disappointed. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;This is bad,&quot; muttered Passepartout, &quot;for the 
                gentlemen of the Reform Club!&quot; He accosted Fix with a merry 
                smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman's chagrin. The 
                detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad 
                luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly 
                on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong 
                for several days; and, this being the last English territory on 
                Mr. Fogg's route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage 
                to detain him. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, Monsieur Fix,&quot; said Passepartout, &quot;have 
                you decided to go with us so far as America?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Fix, through his set teeth. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good!&quot; exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. 
                &quot;I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from 
                us. Come and engage your berth.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four 
                persons. The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them 
                that, the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed, the steamer 
                would leave that very evening, and not next morning, as had been 
                announced. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That will suit my master all the better,&quot; said Passepartout. 
                &quot;I will go and let him know.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout 
                all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas 
                Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited 
                his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. 
                On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely 
                decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished 
                with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. 
                At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty 
                customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; 
                smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls 
                of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of 
                the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the 
                table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, 
                carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty 
                of these stupefied sots. </p>
              <p>　　Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house 
                haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom 
                the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called 
                opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds-- 
                thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict 
                humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal 
                with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the 
                rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower 
                classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is 
                smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial 
                Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense 
                with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. 
                A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he 
                dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, 
                in search of a friendly glass, found themselves. Passepartout 
                had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the hope 
                of returning the obligation at some future time. </p>
              <p>　　They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did 
                ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They 
                chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry 
                at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them. When 
                the bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master 
                of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic. </p>
              <p>　　Fix caught him by the arm, and said, &quot;Wait a moment.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What for, Mr. Fix?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I want to have a serious talk with you.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A serious talk!&quot; cried Passepartout, drinking up 
                the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass. &quot;Well, 
                we'll talk about it to-morrow; I haven't time now.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. 
                Fix's face seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his 
                seat. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is it that you have to say?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering 
                his voice, said, &quot;You have guessed who I am?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Parbleu!&quot; said Passepartout, smiling. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Then I'm going to tell you everything--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that's very 
                good. But go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those 
                gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Useless!&quot; said Fix. &quot;You speak confidently. 
                It's clear that you don't know how large the sum is.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Of course I do,&quot; returned Passepartout. &quot;Twenty 
                thousand pounds.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Fifty-five thousand!&quot; answered Fix, pressing his 
                companion's hand. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What!&quot; cried the Frenchman. &quot;Has Monsieur Fogg 
                dared-- fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, there's all the more 
                reason for not losing an instant,&quot; he continued, getting 
                up hastily. </p>
              <p>　　Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: &quot;Fifty-five 
                thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. 
                If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Help you?&quot; cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing 
                wide open. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied 
                with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must 
                try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They 
                might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That's just what we count on doing.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's a conspiracy, then,&quot; cried Passepartout, who 
                became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, 
                for he drank without perceiving it. &quot;A real conspiracy! And 
                gentlemen, too. Bah!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix began to be puzzled. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Members of the Reform Club!&quot; continued Passepartout. 
                &quot;You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest 
                man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But who do you think I am?&quot; asked Fix, looking at 
                him intently. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, 
                sent out here to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I 
                found you out some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing 
                about it to Mr. Fogg.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;He knows nothing, then?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied Passepartout, again emptying his 
                glass. </p>
              <p>　　The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating 
                before he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake 
                seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was 
                evident that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix 
                had been inclined to suspect. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said the detective to himself, &quot;as he 
                is not an accomplice, he will help me.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, 
                so he resolved to make a clean breast of it. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Listen to me,&quot; said Fix abruptly. &quot;I am not, 
                as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club--&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Bah!&quot; retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am a police detective, sent out here by the London 
                office.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You, a detective?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will prove it. Here is my commission.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed 
                this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fogg's wager,&quot; resumed Fix, &quot;is only a 
                pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. 
                He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But why?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five 
                thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person 
                whose description was fortunately secured. Here is his description; 
                it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What nonsense!&quot; cried Passepartout, striking the 
                table with his fist. &quot;My master is the most honourable of 
                men!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. 
                You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away 
                on a foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount 
                in banknotes. And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is 
                an honest man!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; repeated the poor fellow, mechanically. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head 
                between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. 
                Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, 
                a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! 
                Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves 
                upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was 
                guilty. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, what do you want of me?&quot; said he, at last, 
                with an effort. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;See here,&quot; replied Fix; &quot;I have tracked Mr. 
                Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant 
                of arrest for which I sent to London. You must help me to keep 
                him here in Hong Kong--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I! But I--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward 
                offered by the Bank of England.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Never!&quot; replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, 
                but fell back, exhausted in mind and body. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fix,&quot; he stammered, &quot;even should what you 
                say be true-- if my master is really the robber you are seeking 
                for--which I deny-- I have been, am, in his service; I have seen 
                his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him--not 
                for all the gold in the world. I come from a village where they 
                don't eat that kind of bread!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You refuse?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I refuse.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Consider that I've said nothing,&quot; said Fix; &quot;and 
                let us drink.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes; let us drink!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects 
                of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated 
                from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full 
                of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout's 
                hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several 
                puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the 
                narcotic, fell upon the table. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At last!&quot; said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. 
                &quot;Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatic's departure; 
                and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern. </p>

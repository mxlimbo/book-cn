              <p><b>　　SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG 
                KONG </b></p>
              <p>　　The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this 
                interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce 
                his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He 
                caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but 
                Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept 
                Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand 
                at whist. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange 
                chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. 
                It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable 
                and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then 
                encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, 
                which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly 
                on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg's tracks step by step. 
                What was Fix's object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian 
                shoes--which he religiously preserved--that Fix would also leave 
                Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same 
                steamer. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without 
                hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. 
                He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked 
                as a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to 
                attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered 
                an explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from 
                unreasonable. Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's 
                friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain 
                that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's clear!&quot; repeated the worthy servant to himself, 
                proud of his shrewdness. &quot;He's a spy sent to keep us in view! 
                That isn't quite the thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who 
                is so honourable a man! Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall 
                cost you dear!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say 
                nothing to his master, lest he should be justly offended at this 
                mistrust on the part of his adversaries. But he determined to 
                chaff Fix, when he had the chance, with mysterious allusions, 
                which, however, need not betray his real suspicions. </p>
              <p>　　During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon 
                entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of 
                that name from Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted 
                the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers. 
                The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., 
                to receive coal, having gained half a day on the prescribed time 
                of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and 
                then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on 
                shore, disembarked. </p>
              <p>　　Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them 
                cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, 
                laughing in his sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual 
                errands. </p>
              <p>　　The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there 
                are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. 
                It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome 
                carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried 
                Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant 
                foliage, and of clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart 
                of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges 
                of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, 
                varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in 
                full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume. Agile 
                and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor 
                were tigers wanting in the jungles. </p>
              <p>　　After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. 
                Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, 
                irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical 
                fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely 
                followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes-- 
                a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour 
                outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting 
                in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting 
                for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to 
                Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them. </p>
              <p>　　At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, 
                and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, 
                inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, 
                were lost to view. Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred 
                miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English 
                colony near the Chinese coast. Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish 
                the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer which 
                would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the principal 
                Japanese port. </p>
              <p>　　The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked 
                at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen, 
                Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers. </p>
              <p>　　The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the 
                last quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind 
                at intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the 
                south-west, and thus aided the steamer's progress. The captain 
                as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action 
                of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts 
                of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction 
                of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary 
                in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from 
                this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, 
                did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout blamed 
                the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and consigned all who 
                were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows. 
                Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning 
                at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot 
                impatience. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are in a great hurry, then,&quot; said Fix to him 
                one day, &quot;to reach Hong Kong?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A very great hurry!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer 
                for Yokohama?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Terribly anxious.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You believe in this journey around the world, then?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Absolutely. Don't you, Mr. Fix?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I? I don't believe a word of it.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You're a sly dog!&quot; said Passepartout, winking at 
                him. </p>
              <p>　　This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. 
                Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to 
                think. But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was 
                a detective? Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant 
                more than he expressed. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not 
                hold his tongue. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fix,&quot; said he, in a bantering tone, &quot;shall 
                we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; responded Fix, a little embarrassed, &quot;I 
                don't know; perhaps--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the 
                Peninsular Company, you know, can't stop on the way! You were 
                only going to Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not 
                far off, and from America to Europe is only a step.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was 
                as serene as possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout 
                persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his 
                present occupation. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, and no,&quot; returned Fix; &quot;there is good 
                and bad luck in such things. But you must understand that I don't 
                travel at my own expense.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, I am quite sure of that!&quot; cried Passepartout, 
                laughing heartily. </p>
              <p>　　Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself 
                up to his reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or 
                other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective. But 
                had he told his master? What part was he playing in all this: 
                was he an accomplice or not? Was the game, then, up? Fix spent 
                several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes 
                thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg 
                was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it 
                was best to take. </p>
              <p>　　Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last 
                resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find 
                it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations 
                to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would 
                tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the accomplice of 
                his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, 
                and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the 
                robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile 
                Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious 
                indifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around 
                the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around 
                him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing 
                star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's 
                heart. But no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's 
                great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have 
                been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led 
                to the discovery of Neptune. </p>
              <p>　　It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who 
                read in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. 
                Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite 
                heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened 
                in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor 
                Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries. </p>
              <p>　　One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and 
                was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw 
                the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the 
                valves; and this made Passepartout indignant. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The valves are not sufficiently charged!&quot; he exclaimed. 
                &quot;We are not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American 
                craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events 
                go faster!&quot; </p>

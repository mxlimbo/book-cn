              <p><b>　　IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE &quot;TANKADERE&quot; RUNS GREAT 
                RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS </b></p>
              <p>　　 This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture 
                on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The 
                Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales 
                of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early 
                November. </p>
              <p>　　It would clearly have been to the master's advantage to carry 
                his passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per 
                day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and 
                it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby 
                believed in the Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a seagull; 
                and perhaps he was not wrong. </p>
              <p>　　Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels 
                of Hong Kong, and the Tankadere, impelled by favourable winds, 
                conducted herself admirably. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I do not need, pilot,&quot; said Phileas Fogg, when they 
                got into the open sea, &quot;to advise you to use all possible 
                speed.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the 
                wind will let us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used 
                when we are going into port.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Its your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing 
                like a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. 
                The young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as 
                she looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, 
                on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head 
                rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings. 
                The boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in 
                the air. </p>
              <p>　　Night came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her 
                insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon. 
                Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part 
                of the heavens. </p>
              <p>　　The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary 
                in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions 
                are not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, 
                the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft. </p>
              <p>　　Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept 
                apart from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn 
                tastes; besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose 
                favours he had accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. 
                It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would 
                at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of 
                America would ensure him impunity and safety. Fogg's plan appeared 
                to him the simplest in the world. Instead of sailing directly 
                from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had 
                traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American 
                continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off 
                his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen 
                from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he, 
                Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until 
                he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him 
                for an hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. 
                At all events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout 
                was not with his master; and it was above all important, after 
                the confidences Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should 
                never have speech with his master. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so 
                strangely disappeared. Looking at the matter from every point 
                of view, it did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, 
                the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; 
                and this was also Aouda's opinion, who regretted very much the 
                loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much. They might 
                then find him at Yokohama; for, if the Carnatic was carrying him 
                thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board. 
              </p>
              <p>　　A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might 
                have been prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully 
                examining the heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. 
                The Tankadere bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of 
                water, and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a 
                gale. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having 
                been already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the 
                cots. The pilot and crew remained on deck all night. </p>
              <p>　　At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had 
                made more than one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed 
                of between eight and nine miles. The Tankadere still carried all 
                sail, and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed. If 
                the wind held as it was, the chances would be in her favour. During 
                the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were favourable; 
                the coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across 
                the clearings, was at most five miles distant. The sea was less 
                boisterous, since the wind came off land--a fortunate circumstance 
                for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, 
                by a heavy surge on the sea. </p>
              <p>　　The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from 
                the south-west. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down 
                again within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of 
                the sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share 
                their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin. To travel 
                at this man's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable 
                to him. Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate. </p>
              <p>　　When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, &quot;sir&quot;--this 
                &quot;sir&quot; scorched his lips, and he had to control himself 
                to avoid collaring this &quot;gentleman&quot;--&quot;sir, you 
                have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat. But, though 
                my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, 
                I must ask to pay my share--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Let us not speak of that, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But, if I insist--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, sir,&quot; repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did 
                not admit of a reply. &quot;This enters into my general expenses.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, 
                where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest 
                of the day. </p>
              <p>　　Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was 
                in high hope. He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would 
                reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that 
                he counted upon it. The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired 
                by the reward to be gained. There was not a sheet which was not 
                tightened not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch 
                could be charged to the man at the helm. They worked as desperately 
                as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta. </p>
              <p>　　By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles 
                had been accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope 
                that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any 
                delay in his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which 
                had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect 
                his journey. </p>
              <p>　　The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate 
                the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours 
                of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very 
                rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, 
                and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very 
                difficult to stand on deck. </p>
              <p>　　At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens 
                seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, 
                the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in 
                the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. 
                The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst 
                of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean. </p>
              <p>　　John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, 
                muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a 
                low voice to Mr. Fogg, &quot;Shall I speak out to your honour?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Of course.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, we are going to have a squall.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is the wind north or south?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg quietly. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;South. Look! a typhoon is coming up.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry 
                us forward.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, if you take it that way,&quot; said John Bunsby, 
                &quot;I've nothing more to say.&quot; John Bunsby's suspicions 
                were confirmed. At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon, 
                according to a famous meteorologist, would have passed away like 
                a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox 
                it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The pilot took his precautions in advance. He reefed all sail, 
                the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to 
                the bows. A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted 
                as a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they 
                waited. </p>
              <p>　　John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this 
                imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat 
                bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, 
                Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck. </p>
              <p>　　The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight 
                o'clock. With but its bit of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like 
                a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be 
                given. To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive 
                going on full steam would be below the truth. </p>
              <p>　　The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne 
                on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed 
                equal to theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged 
                by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit 
                management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed 
                in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed 
                it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, 
                whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely 
                weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if 
                the typhoon were a part of his programme. </p>
              <p>　　Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to 
                the north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, 
                bore down from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough 
                of the waves, shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with 
                fearful violence. At night the tempest increased in violence. 
                John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the 
                storm with dark misgivings. He thought awhile, and then asked 
                his crew if it was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation 
                he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, &quot;I think, your honour, 
                that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I think so too.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said the pilot. &quot;But which one?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I know of but one,&quot; returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And that is--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Shanghai.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely 
                realise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, &quot;Well--yes! 
                Your honour is right. To Shanghai!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track. </p>
              <p>　　The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the 
                craft did not founder. Twice it could have been all over with 
                her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch. Aouda was 
                exhausted, but did not utter a complaint. More than once Mr. Fogg 
                rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves. </p>
              <p>　　Day reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; 
                but the wind now returned to the south-east. It was a favourable 
                change, and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous 
                sea, though the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks 
                and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly 
                built. From time to time the coast was visible through the broken 
                mist, but no vessel was in sight. The Tankadere was alone upon 
                the sea. </p>
              <p>　　There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more 
                distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon. The tempest 
                had been as brief as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, 
                could now eat a little, and take some repose. </p>
              <p>　　The night was comparatively quiet. Some of the sails were again 
                hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good. The next morning 
                at dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert 
                that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred 
                miles, and only one day to traverse them! That very evening Mr. 
                Fogg was due at Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer 
                to Yokohama. Had there been no storm, during which several hours 
                were lost, they would be at this moment within thirty miles of 
                their destination. </p>
              <p>　　The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with 
                it. All sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was 
                within forty-five miles of Shanghai. There remained yet six hours 
                in which to accomplish that distance. All on board feared that 
                it could not be done, and every one--Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted--felt 
                his heart beat with impatience. The boat must keep up an average 
                of nine miles an hour, and the wind was becoming calmer every 
                moment! It was a capricious breeze, coming from the coast, and 
                after it passed the sea became smooth. Still, the Tankadere was 
                so light, and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well, 
                that, with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at 
                six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai 
                River. Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the 
                stream. At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai. The 
                pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred pounds was 
                evidently on the point of escaping him. He looked at Mr. Fogg. 
                Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was 
                at this moment at stake. </p>
              <p>　　At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths 
                of smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters. It was the American 
                steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Confound her!&quot; cried John Bunsby, pushing back the 
                rudder with a desperate jerk. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Signal her!&quot; said Phileas Fogg quietly. </p>
              <p>　　A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere, 
                for making signals in the fogs. It was loaded to the muzzle; but 
                just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, 
                Mr. Fogg said, &quot;Hoist your flag!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal 
                of distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving 
                it, would change her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Fire!&quot; said Mr. Fogg. And the booming of the little 
                cannon resounded in the air.</p>

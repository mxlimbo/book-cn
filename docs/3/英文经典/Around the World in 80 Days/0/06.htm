              <p><b>　　IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, BETRAYS A VERY NATURAL IMPATIENCE 
                </b> </p>
              <p>　　 The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about 
                Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows: </p>
              <p>　　The steamer Mongolia, belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental 
                Company, built of iron, of two thousand eight hundred tons burden, 
                and five hundred horse-power, was due at eleven o'clock a.m. on 
                Wednesday, the 9th of October, at Suez. The Mongolia plied regularly 
                between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal, and was one of 
                the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more 
                than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and 
                a half between Suez and Bombay. </p>
              <p>　　Two men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the 
                crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once 
                straggling village-- now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, 
                a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, 
                despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable 
                predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his 
                office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great 
                canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India 
                by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half. The 
                other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent 
                face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he 
                was incessantly twitching. He was just now manifesting unmistakable 
                signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable 
                to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of the detectives 
                who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; 
                it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived 
                at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, 
                or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal, which 
                he had received two days before from the police headquarters at 
                London. The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining 
                the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited 
                with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of 
                the steamer Mongolia. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;So you say, consul,&quot; asked he for the twentieth 
                time, &quot;that this steamer is never behind time?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, Mr. Fix,&quot; replied the consul. &quot;She was 
                bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of 
                no account to such a craft. I repeat that the Mongolia has been 
                in advance of the time required by the company's regulations, 
                and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Does she come directly from Brindisi?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails 
                there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, 
                Mr. Fix; she will not be late. But really, I don't see how, from 
                the description you have, you will be able to recognise your man, 
                even if he is on board the Mongolia.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, 
                than recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent 
                is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. 
                I've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, 
                if my thief is on board, I'll answer for it; he'll not slip through 
                my fingers.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! 
                We don't often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be 
                so contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of 
                shillings!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fix,&quot; said the consul, &quot;I like your way 
                of talking, and hope you'll succeed; but I fear you will find 
                it far from easy. Don't you see, the description which you have 
                there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Consul,&quot; remarked the detective, dogmatically, &quot;great 
                robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally 
                faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; 
                otherwise they would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing 
                is, to unmask honest countenances; it's no light task, I admit, 
                but a real art.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; 
                sailors of various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters, 
                fellahs, bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately 
                expected. The weather was clear, and slightly chilly. The minarets 
                of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun. 
                A jetty pier, some two thousand yards along, extended into the 
                roadstead. A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats, some 
                retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys, were discernible 
                on the Red Sea. </p>
              <p>　　As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, according to habit, 
                scrutinised the passers-by with a keen, rapid glance. </p>
              <p>　　It was now half-past ten. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The steamer doesn't come!&quot; he exclaimed, as the 
                port clock struck. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;She can't be far off now,&quot; returned his companion. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;How long will she stop at Suez?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Four hours; long enough to get in her coal. It is thirteen 
                hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the 
                Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal supply.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Without putting in anywhere.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good!&quot; said Fix. &quot;If the robber is on board 
                he will no doubt get off at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or 
                French colonies in Asia by some other route. He ought to know 
                that he would not be safe an hour in India, which is English soil.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Unless,&quot; objected the consul, &quot;he is exceptionally 
                shrewd. An English criminal, you know, is always better concealed 
                n London than anywhere else.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　This observation furnished the detective food for thought, 
                and meanwhile the consul went away to his office. Fix, left alone, 
                was more impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the robber 
                was on board the Mongolia. If he had indeed left London intending 
                to reach the New World, he would naturally take the route via 
                India, which was less watched and more difficult to watch than 
                that of the Atlantic. But Fix's reflections were soon interrupted 
                by a succession of sharp whistles, which announced the arrival 
                of the Mongolia. The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay, 
                and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the 
                steamer. Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between 
                the banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road. 
                She brought an unusual number of passengers, some of whom remained 
                on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town, while the 
                greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on the quay. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and 
                figure which made its appearance. Presently one of the passengers, 
                after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd 
                of porters, came up to him and politely asked if he could point 
                out the English consulate, at the same time showing a passport 
                which he wished to have visaed. Fix instinctively took the passport, 
                and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer. An 
                involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him, for the description 
                in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which 
                he had received from Scotland Yard. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is this your passport?&quot; asked he. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, it's my master's.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And your master is--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;He stayed on board.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But he must go to the consul's in person, so as to establish 
                his identity.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, is that necessary?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Quite indispensable.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And where is the consulate?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;There, on the corner of the square,&quot; said Fix, pointing 
                to a house two hundred steps off. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I'll go and fetch my master, who won't be much pleased, 
                however, to be disturbed.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The passenger bowed to Fix, and returned to the steamer. </p>

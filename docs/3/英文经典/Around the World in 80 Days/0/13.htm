              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE 
                FAVORS THE BRAVE </b></p>
              <p>　　 The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable. 
                Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore 
                the success of his tour. But he did not hesitate, and he found 
                in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally. </p>
              <p>　　As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be 
                proposed. His master's idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, 
                a soul, under that icy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg. 
              </p>
              <p>　　There remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would 
                he not take part with the Indians? In default of his assistance, 
                it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality. </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis frankly put the question to him. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Officers,&quot; replied the guide, &quot;I am a Parsee, 
                and this woman is a Parsee. Command me as you will.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Excellent!&quot; said Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;However,&quot; resumed the guide, &quot;it is certain, 
                not only that we shall risk our lives, but horrible tortures, 
                if we are taken.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That is foreseen,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. &quot;I think 
                we must wait till night before acting.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I think so,&quot; said the guide. </p>
              <p>　　The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, 
                he said, was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter 
                of a wealthy Bombay merchant. She had received a thoroughly English 
                education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, 
                would be thought an European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, 
                she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; 
                and, knowing the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, 
                and devoted by the rajah's relatives, who had an interest in her 
                death, to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The Parsee's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions 
                in their generous design. It was decided that the guide should 
                direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly 
                approached as quickly as possible. They halted, half an hour afterwards, 
                in a copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they 
                were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries 
                of the fakirs distinctly. </p>
              <p>　　They then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The 
                guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he 
                declared, the young woman was imprisoned. Could they enter any 
                of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a 
                drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the 
                walls? This could only be determined at the moment and the place 
                themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made 
                that night, and not when, at break of day, the victim was led 
                to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could save her. 
              </p>
              <p>　　As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make 
                a reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were 
                just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves 
                into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, 
                and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the 
                wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of 
                a small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they 
                perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed 
                body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, 
                whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood 
                a hundred steps away. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Come!&quot; whispered the guide. </p>
              <p>　　He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed 
                by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low 
                murmuring of the wind among the branches. </p>
              <p>　　Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which 
                was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of 
                the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield 
                strewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together. </p>
              <p>　　In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed 
                distinctly. Much to the guide's disappointment, the guards of 
                the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and 
                marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, 
                were watching within. </p>
              <p>　　The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an 
                entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions 
                back again. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that 
                nothing could be attempted in that direction. They stopped, and 
                engaged in a whispered colloquy. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is only eight now,&quot; said the brigadier, &quot;and 
                these guards may also go to sleep.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is not impossible,&quot; returned the Parsee. </p>
              <p>　　They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited. </p>
              <p>　　The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to 
                take an observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched 
                steadily by the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through 
                the windows of the pagoda. </p>
              <p>　　They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the 
                guards, and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could 
                not be counted on. The other plan must be carried out; an opening 
                in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain 
                whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim 
                as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door. </p>
              <p>　　After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was 
                ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They 
                took a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. 
                They reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having 
                met anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows 
                or doors. </p>
              <p>　　The night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the 
                horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the 
                trees deepened the darkness. </p>
              <p>　　It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must 
                be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had 
                their pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick 
                and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after 
                one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily. </p>
              <p>　　They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and 
                Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to 
                make an aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, 
                when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed 
                almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout 
                and the guide stopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being 
                given? Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, 
                followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves 
                in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might 
                be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without 
                delay. But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear 
                of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to 
                prevent a surprise. </p>
              <p>　　It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the 
                party, thus interrupted in their work. They could not now reach 
                the victim; how, then, could they save her? Sir Francis shook 
                his fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed 
                his teeth with rage. The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying 
                any emotion. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;We have nothing to do but to go away,&quot; whispered 
                Sir Francis. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Nothing but to go away,&quot; echoed the guide. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Stop,&quot; said Fogg. &quot;I am only due at Allahabad 
                tomorrow before noon.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But what can you hope to do?&quot; asked Sir Francis. 
                &quot;In a few hours it will be daylight, and--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The chance which now seems lost may present itself at 
                the last moment.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's eyes. What 
                was this cool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make 
                a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, 
                and boldly snatch her from her executioners? </p>
              <p>　　This would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg 
                was such a fool. Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to 
                the end of this terrible drama. The guide led them to the rear 
                of the glade, where they were able to observe the sleeping groups. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower 
                branches of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck 
                him like a flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain. 
              </p>
              <p>　　He had commenced by saying to himself, &quot;What folly!&quot; 
                and then he repeated, &quot;Why not, after all? It's a chance 
                perhaps the only one; and with such sots!&quot; Thinking thus, 
                he slipped, with the suppleness of a serpent, to the lowest branches, 
                the ends of which bent almost to the ground. </p>
              <p>　　The hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the 
                approach of day, though it was not yet light. This was the moment. 
                The slumbering multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, 
                songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come. The 
                doors of the pagoda swung open, and a bright light escaped from 
                its interior, in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied 
                the victim. She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, 
                to be striving to escape from her executioner. Sir Francis's heart 
                throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg's hand, found in 
                it an open knife. Just at this moment the crowd began to move. 
                The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes 
                of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted her with their 
                wild, religious cries. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks 
                of the crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks 
                of the stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which 
                still lay the rajah's corpse. In the semi-obscurity they saw the 
                victim, quite senseless, stretched out beside her husband's body. 
                Then a torch was brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, 
                instantly took fire. </p>
              <p>　　At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, 
                who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the 
                pyre. But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene 
                suddenly changed. A cry of terror arose. The whole multitude prostrated 
                themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground. </p>
              <p>　　The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, 
                like a spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from 
                the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened 
                his ghostly appearance. </p>
              <p>　　Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, 
                lay there, with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift 
                their eyes and behold such a prodigy. </p>
              <p>　　The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which 
                supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden. 
                Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, 
                and Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied. </p>
              <p>　　The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, 
                and, in an abrupt tone, said, &quot;Let us be off!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre 
                in the midst of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging 
                darkness, had delivered the young woman from death! It was Passepartout 
                who, playing his part with a happy audacity, had passed through 
                the crowd amid the general terror. </p>
              <p>　　A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the 
                woods, and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. 
                But the cries and noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas 
                Fogg's hat, apprised them that the trick had been discovered. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The old rajah's body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning 
                pyre; and the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived 
                that an abduction had taken place. They hastened into the forest, 
                followed by the soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; 
                but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them, and 
                ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and 
                arrows.</p>

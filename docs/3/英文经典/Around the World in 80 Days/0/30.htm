              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY </b></p>
              <p>　　 Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared. Had 
                they been killed in the struggle? Were they taken prisoners by 
                the Sioux? It was impossible to tell. </p>
              <p>　　There were many wounded, but none mortally. Colonel Proctor 
                was one of the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely, and 
                a ball had entered his groin. He was carried into the station 
                with the other wounded passengers, to receive such attention as 
                could be of avail. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest 
                of the fight, had not received a scratch. Fix was slightly wounded 
                in the arm. But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed 
                down Aouda's cheeks. </p>
              <p>　　All the passengers had got out of the train, the wheels of 
                which were stained with blood. From the tyres and spokes hung 
                ragged pieces of flesh. As far as the eye could reach on the white 
                plain behind, red trails were visible. The last Sioux were disappearing 
                in the south, along the banks of Republican River. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless. He had a serious 
                decision to make. Aouda, standing near him, looked at him without 
                speaking, and he understood her look. If his servant was a prisoner, 
                ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians? 
                &quot;I will find him, living or dead,&quot; said he quietly to 
                Aouda. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah, Mr.--Mr. Fogg!&quot; cried she, clasping his hands 
                and covering them with tears. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Living,&quot; added Mr. Fogg, &quot;if we do not lose 
                a moment.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; 
                he pronounced his own doom. The delay of a single day would make 
                him lose the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly 
                lost. But as he thought, &quot;It is my duty,&quot; he did not 
                hesitate. </p>
              <p>　　The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there. A hundred 
                of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend 
                the station, should the Sioux attack it. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sir,&quot; said Mr. Fogg to the captain, &quot;three 
                passengers have disappeared.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Dead?&quot; asked the captain. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must 
                be solved. Do you propose to pursue the Sioux?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That's a serious thing to do, sir,&quot; returned the 
                captain. &quot;These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, 
                and I cannot leave the fort unprotected.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The lives of three men are in question, sir,&quot; said 
                Phileas Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save 
                three?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I don't know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do 
                so.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Nobody here,&quot; returned the other, &quot;has a right 
                to teach me my duty.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, coldly. &quot;I will 
                go alone.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You, sir!&quot; cried Fix, coming up; &quot;you go alone 
                in pursuit of the Indians?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish-- 
                him to whom every one present owes his life? I shall go.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, sir, you shall not go alone,&quot; cried the captain, 
                touched in spite of himself. &quot;No! you are a brave man. Thirty 
                volunteers!&quot; he added, turning to the soldiers. </p>
              <p>　　The whole company started forward at once. The captain had 
                only to pick his men. Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant 
                placed at their head. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Thanks, captain,&quot; said Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Will you let me go with you?&quot; asked Fix. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Do as you please, sir. But if you wish to do me a favour, 
                you will remain with Aouda. In case anything should happen to 
                me--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　A sudden pallor overspread the detective's face. Separate himself 
                from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step! 
                Leave him to wander about in this desert! Fix gazed attentively 
                at Mr. Fogg, and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle which 
                was going on within him, he lowered his eyes before that calm 
                and frank look. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will stay,&quot; said he. </p>
              <p>　　A few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman's hand, 
                and, having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off 
                with the sergeant and his little squad. But, before going, he 
                had said to the soldiers, &quot;My friends, I will divide five 
                thousand dollars among you, if we save the prisoners.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It was then a little past noon. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone, 
                thinking of the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil courage 
                of Phileas Fogg. He had sacrificed his fortune, and was now risking 
                his life, all without hesitation, from duty, in silence. </p>
              <p>　　Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal 
                his agitation. He walked feverishly up and down the platform, 
                but soon resumed his outward composure. He now saw the folly of 
                which he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone. What! This 
                man, whom he had just followed around the world, was permitted 
                now to separate himself from him! He began to accuse and abuse 
                himself, and, as if he were director of police, administered to 
                himself a sound lecture for his greenness. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I have been an idiot!&quot; he thought, &quot;and this 
                man will see it. He has gone, and won't come back! But how is 
                it that I, Fix, who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest, 
                have been so fascinated by him? Decidedly, I am nothing but an 
                ass!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too 
                slowly. He did not know what to do. Sometimes he was tempted to 
                tell Aouda all; but he could not doubt how the young woman would 
                receive his confidences. What course should he take? He thought 
                of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains; it did not seem 
                impossible that he might overtake him. Footsteps were easily printed 
                on the snow! But soon, under a new sheet, every imprint would 
                be effaced. </p>
              <p>　　Fix became discouraged. He felt a sort of insurmountable longing 
                to abandon the game altogether. He could now leave Fort Kearney 
                station, and pursue his journey homeward in peace. </p>
              <p>　　Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing 
                hard, long whistles were heard approaching from the east. A great 
                shadow, preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still 
                larger through the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect. No 
                train was expected from the east, neither had there been time 
                for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from 
                Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day. The mystery 
                was soon explained. </p>
              <p>　　The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening 
                whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train, 
                had continued its route with such terrific rapidity, carrying 
                off the unconscious engineer and stoker. It had run several miles, 
                when, the fire becoming low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; 
                and it had finally stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond 
                Fort Kearney. Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, 
                after remaining for some time in their swoon, had come to themselves. 
                The train had then stopped. The engineer, when he found himself 
                in the desert, and the locomotive without cars, understood what 
                had happened. He could not imagine how the locomotive had become 
                separated from the train; but he did not doubt that the train 
                left behind was in distress. </p>
              <p>　　He did not hesitate what to do. It would be prudent to continue 
                on to Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, 
                which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging. Nevertheless, 
                he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again 
                mounted, and the locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort 
                Kearney. This it was which was whistling in the mist. </p>
              <p>　　The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place 
                at the head of the train. They could now continue the journey 
                so terribly interrupted. </p>
              <p>　　Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the 
                station, and asked the conductor, &quot;Are you going to start?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;At once, madam.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers--&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I cannot interrupt the trip,&quot; replied the conductor. 
                &quot;We are already three hours behind time.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To-morrow evening, madam.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To-morrow evening! But then it will be too late! We must 
                wait--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is impossible,&quot; responded the conductor. &quot;If 
                you wish to go, please get in.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I will not go,&quot; said Aouda. </p>
              <p>　　Fix had heard this conversation. A little while before, when 
                there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made 
                up his mind to leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was 
                there, ready to start, and he had only to take his seat in the 
                car, an irresistible influence held him back. The station platform 
                burned his feet, and he could not stir. The conflict in his mind 
                again began; anger and failure stifled him. He wished to struggle 
                on to the end. </p>
              <p>　　Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them 
                Colonel Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their 
                places in the train. The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was 
                heard, and the steam was escaping from the valves. The engineer 
                whistled, the train started, and soon disappeared, mingling its 
                white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow. </p>
              <p>　　The detective had remained behind. </p>
              <p>　　Several hours passed. The weather was dismal, and it was very 
                cold. Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have 
                been thought asleep. Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out 
                of the waiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and peering 
                through the tempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed 
                the horizon around her, and to hear, if possible, some welcome 
                sound. She heard and saw nothing. Then she would return, chilled 
                through, to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments, 
                but always in vain. </p>
              <p>　　Evening came, and the little band had not returned. Where could 
                they be? Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict 
                with them, or were they still wandering amid the mist? The commander 
                of the fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions. 
                As night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became 
                intensely cold. Absolute silence rested on the plains. Neither 
                flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart 
                stifled with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains. 
                Her imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable 
                dangers. What she suffered through the long hours it would be 
                impossible to describe. </p>
              <p>　　Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep. 
                Once a man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely 
                replied by shaking his head. </p>
              <p>　　Thus the night passed. At dawn, the half-extinguished disc 
                of the sun rose above a misty horizon ; but it was now possible 
                to recognise objects two miles off. Phileas Fogg and the squad 
                had gone southward; in the south all was still vacancy. It was 
                then seven o'clock. </p>
              <p>　　The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course 
                to take. </p>
              <p>　　Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first? 
                Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those 
                already sacrificed? His hesitation did not last long, however. 
                Calling one of his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering 
                a reconnaissance, when gunshots were heard. Was it a signal? The 
                soldiers rushed out of the fort, and half a mile off they perceived 
                a little band returning in good order. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were 
                Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux. 
              </p>
              <p>　　They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort 
                Kearney. Shortly before the detachment arrived. Passepartout and 
                his companions had begun to struggle with their captors, three 
                of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists, when his master 
                and the soldiers hastened up to their relief. </p>
              <p>　　All were welcomed with joyful cries. Phileas Fogg distributed 
                the reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, 
                not without reason, muttered to himself, &quot;It must certainly 
                be confessed that I cost my master dear!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would 
                have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within 
                him. As for Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it 
                in her own, too much moved to speak. </p>
              <p>　　Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he 
                thought he should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and 
                he hoped that the time lost might be regained. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The train! the train!&quot; cried he. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Gone,&quot; replied Fix. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And when does the next train pass here?&quot; said Phileas

              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND 
                HIS IDEAL </b></p>
              <p>　　 &quot;Faith,&quot; muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, 
                &quot;I've seen people at Madame Tussaud's as lively as my new 
                master!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Madame Tussaud's &quot;people,&quot; let it be said, are of 
                wax, and are much visited in London; speech is all that is wanting 
                to make them human. </p>
              <p>　　During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had 
                been carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty 
                years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped 
                figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact 
                and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His 
                countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists 
                call &quot;repose in action,&quot; a quality of those who act 
                rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg 
                seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica 
                Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen in the 
                various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly 
                well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer. Phileas 
                Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed 
                even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, 
                as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of 
                the passions. </p>
              <p>　　He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, 
                and was economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never 
                took one step too many, and always went to his destination by 
                the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never 
                seen to be moved or agitated. He was the most deliberate person 
                in the world, yet always reached his destination at the exact 
                moment. </p>
              <p>　　He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; 
                and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, 
                and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody. </p>
              <p>　　As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since 
                he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as 
                a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart. 
                Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted 
                by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he 
                was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, 
                soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as 
                one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, 
                his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, 
                his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by 
                the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat 
                tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known 
                eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses, Passepartout 
                was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of 
                a large-tooth comb completed his toilet. </p>
              <p>　　It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature 
                would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the 
                new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master 
                required; experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout 
                had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned 
                for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had 
                already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root 
                in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably 
                whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, 
                or on the look-out for adventure. His last master, young Lord 
                Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the 
                Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on 
                policemen's shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the 
                gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such 
                conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing 
                that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his 
                life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled 
                nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be 
                the place he was after. He presented himself, and was accepted, 
                as has been seen. </p>
              <p>　　At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone 
                in the house in Saville Row. He begun its inspection without delay, 
                scouring it from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged, solemn 
                a mansion pleased him ; it seemed to him like a snail's shell, 
                lighted and warmed by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes. 
                When Passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once 
                the room which he was to inhabit, and he was well satisfied with 
                it. Electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with 
                the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock, 
                precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's bedchamber, both beating the 
                same second at the same instant. &quot;That's good, that'll do,&quot; 
                said Passepartout to himself. </p>
              <p>　　He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon 
                inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the 
                house. It comprised all that was required of the servant, from 
                eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, 
                till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all 
                the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes 
                past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, 
                and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten. Everything was regulated 
                and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till 
                midnight, the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. 
                Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating 
                the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid 
                out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's 
                shoes. In short, the house in Saville Row, which must have been 
                a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but 
                dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness, comfort, and method idealised. 
                There was no study, nor were there books, which would have been 
                quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the Reform two libraries, one 
                of general literature and the other of law and politics, were 
                at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom, constructed 
                so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but Passepartout found 
                neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed 
                the most tranquil and peaceable habits. </p>
              <p>　　Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed 
                his hands, a broad smile overspread his features, and he said 
                joyfully, &quot;This is just what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on 
                together, Mr. Fogg and I! What a domestic and regular gentleman! 
                A real machine; well, I don't mind serving a machine.&quot; </p>

              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OFF WITH THE 
                LOSS OF HIS SHOES </b></p>
              <p>　　 Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, 
                with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is 
                called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, 
                upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and 
                eighty millions of souls. The British Crown exercises a real and 
                despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country, 
                and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta, governors at 
                Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor at Agra. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But British India, properly so called, only embraces seven 
                hundred thousand square miles, and a population of from one hundred 
                to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants. A considerable 
                portion of India is still free from British authority; and there 
                are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely 
                independent. The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful 
                from 1756, when the English first gained a foothold on the spot 
                where now stands the city of Madras, down to the time of the great 
                Sepoy insurrection. It gradually annexed province after province, 
                purchasing them of the native chiefs, whom it seldom paid, and 
                appointed the governor-general and his subordinates, civil and 
                military. But the East India Company has now passed away, leaving 
                the British possessions in India directly under the control of 
                the Crown. The aspect of the country, as well as the manners and 
                distinctions of race, is daily changing. </p>
              <p>　　Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous 
                methods of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldly 
                coaches; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, 
                and a great railway, with branch lines joining the main line at 
                many points on its route, traverses the peninsula from Bombay 
                to Calcutta in three days. This railway does not run in a direct 
                line across India. The distance between Bombay and Calcutta, as 
                the bird flies, is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; 
                but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more 
                than a third. </p>
              <p>　　The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is 
                as follows: Leaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing 
                to the continent opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western 
                Ghauts, runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor, skirts the 
                nearly independent territory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, 
                turns thence eastwardly, meeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs 
                from the river a little, and, descending south-eastward by Burdivan 
                and the French town of Chandernagor, has its terminus at Calcutta. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four 
                p.m.; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg, after bidding good-bye to his whist partners, left 
                the steamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it 
                upon him to be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his 
                regular step, which beat to the second, like a astronomical clock, 
                directed his steps to the passport office. As for the wonders 
                of Bombay its famous city hall, its splendid library, its forts 
                and docks, its bazaars, mosques, synagogues, its Armenian churches, 
                and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill, with its two polygonal towers-- 
                he cared not a straw to see them. He would not deign to examine 
                even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or the mysterious hypogea, 
                concealed south-east from the docks, or those fine remains of 
                Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the island of 
                Salcette. </p>
              <p>　　Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas 
                Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered 
                dinner. Among the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially 
                recommended a certain giblet of &quot;native rabbit,&quot; on 
                which he prided himself. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced 
                sauce, found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, 
                and, on his appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, 
                &quot;Is this rabbit, sir?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; the rogue boldly replied, &quot;rabbit 
                from the jungles.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you--&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: 
                cats were formerly considered, in India, as sacred animals. That 
                was a good time.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;For the cats, my lord?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Perhaps for the travellers as well!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner. Fix had 
                gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his first destination 
                was the headquarters of the Bombay police. He made himself known 
                as a London detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position 
                of affairs relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked 
                if a warrant had arrived from London. It had not reached the office; 
                indeed, there had not yet been time for it to arrive. Fix was 
                sorely disappointed, and tried to obtain an order of arrest from 
                the director of the Bombay police. This the director refused, 
                as the matter concerned the London office, which alone could legally 
                deliver the warrant. Fix did not insist, and was fain to resign 
                himself to await the arrival of the important document; but he 
                was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long 
                as he stayed in Bombay. He did not doubt for a moment, any more 
                than Passepartout, that Phileas Fogg would remain there, at least 
                until it was time for the warrant to arrive. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master's orders 
                on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to 
                leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey 
                would be extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond 
                that place. He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg 
                talked about was not really in good earnest, and whether his fate 
                was not in truth forcing him, despite his love of repose, around 
                the world in eighty days! </p>
              <p>　　Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took 
                a leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people 
                of many nationalities--Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, 
                Banyas with round turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees 
                with black mitres, and long-robed Armenians--were collected. It 
                happened to be the day of a Parsee festival. These descendants 
                of the sect of Zoroaster--the most thrifty, civilised, intelligent, 
                and austere of the East Indians, among whom are counted the richest 
                native merchants of Bombay--were celebrating a sort of religious 
                carnival, with processions and shows, in the midst of which Indian 
                dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured gauze, looped up with 
                gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect modesty, to the 
                sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is needless 
                to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with 
                staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that 
                of the greenest booby imaginable. </p>
              <p>　　Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity 
                drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go. At 
                last, having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, 
                he was turning his steps towards the station, when he happened 
                to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill, and was seized with 
                an irresistible desire to see its interior. He was quite ignorant 
                that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples, 
                and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving 
                their shoes outside the door. It may be said here that the wise 
                policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard 
                of the practices of the native religions. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple 
                tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin 
                ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden 
                he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up 
                to behold three enraged priests, who forthwith fell upon him; 
                tore off his shoes, and began to beat him with loud, savage exclamations. 
                The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, and lost no 
                time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with 
                his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then, rushing 
                out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him, he soon 
                escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets. 
              </p>
              <p>　　At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, 
                and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, 
                rushed breathlessly into the station. </p>
              <p>　　Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that 
                he was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. 
                He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and 
                farther, if necessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, 
                who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures 
                in a few words to Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I hope that this will not happen again,&quot; said Phileas 
                Fogg coldly, as he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite 
                crestfallen, followed his master without a word. Fix was on the 
                point of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him which 
                induced him to alter his plan. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No, I'll stay,&quot; muttered he. &quot;An offence has 
                been committed on Indian soil. I've got my man.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train 
                passed out into the darkness of the night. </p>

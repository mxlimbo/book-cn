              <p><b>　　IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS 
                OF PHILEAS FOGG </b></p>
              <p>　　 Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time. Passepartout, 
                the involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate. He had ruined 
                his master! </p>
              <p>　　At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking 
                him intently in the face, said: </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Quite seriously.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I have a purpose in asking,&quot; resumed Fix. &quot;Is 
                it absolutely necessary that you should be in New York on the 
                11th, before nine o'clock in the evening, the time that the steamer 
                leaves for Liverpool?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is absolutely necessary.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these 
                Indians, you would have reached New York on the morning of the 
                11th?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind. Twelve from 
                twenty leaves eight. You must regain eight hours. Do you wish 
                to try to do so?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;On foot?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No; on a sledge,&quot; replied Fix. &quot;On a sledge 
                with sails. A man has proposed such a method to me.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and 
                whose offer he had refused. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed 
                out the man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, 
                Mr. Fogg went up to him. An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, 
                whose name was Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort. 
              </p>
              <p>　　There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame 
                on two long beams, a little raised in front like the runners of 
                a sledge, and upon which there was room for five or six persons. 
                A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, 
                to which was attached a large brigantine sail. This mast held 
                an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail. Behind, a sort of 
                rudder served to guide the vehicle. It was, in short, a sledge 
                rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when the trains are blocked 
                up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across 
                the frozen plains from one station to another. Provided with more 
                sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them, they slip 
                over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior 
                to that of the express trains. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft. 
                The wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west. 
                The snow had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able 
                to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha. Thence the trains 
                eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York. It was not impossible 
                that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity 
                was not to be rejected. </p>
              <p>　　Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling 
                in the open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout 
                at Fort Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her 
                to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions. 
                But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout 
                was delighted with her decision; for nothing could induce him 
                to leave his master while Fix was with him. </p>
              <p>　　It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts. Was 
                this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still 
                regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round 
                the world completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England? 
                Perhaps Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but 
                he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the 
                return of the whole party to England as much as possible. </p>
              <p>　　At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start. The passengers 
                took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in 
                their travelling-cloaks. The two great sails were hoisted, and 
                under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened 
                snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour. </p>
              <p>　　The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, 
                is at most two hundred miles. If the wind held good, the distance 
                might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the 
                sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock. </p>
              <p>　　What a journey! The travellers, huddled close together, could 
                not speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they 
                were going. The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves. 
                When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be 
                lifted off the ground by its sails. Mudge, who was at the rudder, 
                kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the 
                lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make. All the sails 
                were up, and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine. 
                A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, held out to the wind, 
                added its force to the other sails. Although the speed could not 
                be exactly estimated, the sledge could not be going at less than 
                forty miles an hour. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;If nothing breaks,&quot; said Mudge, &quot;we shall get 
                there!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within 
                the time agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward. </p>
              <p>　　The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight 
                line, was as flat as a sea. It seemed like a vast frozen lake. 
                The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the 
                south-west to the north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important 
                Nebraska town, Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha. It followed throughout 
                the right bank of the Platte River. The sledge, shortening this 
                route, took a chord of the arc described by the railway. Mudge 
                was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River, because it 
                was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of obstacles, and 
                Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear-- an accident to the sledge, 
                and a change or calm in the wind. </p>
              <p>　　But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to 
                bend the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. 
                These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded 
                as if vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst 
                of a plaintively intense melody. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Those chords give the fifth and the octave,&quot; said 
                Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　These were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, 
                cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible 
                from the attacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his 
                face was as red as the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and 
                he laboriously inhaled the biting air. With his natural buoyancy 
                of spirits, he began to hope again. They would reach New York 
                on the evening, if not on the morning, of the 11th, and there 
                was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed 
                for Liverpool. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, 
                by the hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured 
                the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked 
                by some presentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however, 
                Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which 
                Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the 
                Sioux. Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant 
                would never forget that! </p>
              <p>　　While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, 
                the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks 
                it passed over were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared 
                under the uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. 
                Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney 
                with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island. Neither 
                village, station, nor fort appeared. From time to time they sped 
                by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled 
                in the wind. Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of 
                gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the 
                sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held himself ready to 
                fire on those which came too near. Had an accident then happened 
                to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts, would 
                have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even 
                course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling 
                band at a safe distance behind. </p>
              <p>　　About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was 
                crossing the Platte River. He said nothing, but he felt certain 
                that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha. In less than an 
                hour he left the rudder and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, 
                carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it, went 
                on half a mile further with its sails unspread. </p>
              <p>　　It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs 
                white with snow, said: &quot;We have got there!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Arrived! Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, 
                by numerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard! </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened 
                limbs, and aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from 
                the sledge. Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand 
                Passepartout warmly grasped, and the party directed their steps 
                to the Omaha railway station. </p>
              <p>　　The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important 
                Nebraska town. Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago 
                and Rock Island Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes 
                fifty stations. </p>
              <p>　　A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached 
                the station, and they only had time to get into the cars. They 
                had seen nothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself 
                that this was not to be regretted, as they were not travelling 
                to see the sights. </p>
              <p>　　The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa, by Council 
                Bluffs, Des Moines, and Iowa City. During the night it crossed 
                the Mississippi at Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois. 
                The next day, which was the 10th, at four o'clock in the evening, 
                it reached Chicago, already risen from its ruins, and more proudly 
                seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains 
                are not wanting at Chicago. Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to 
                the other, and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and 
                Chicago Railway left at full speed, as if it fully comprehended 
                that that gentleman had no time to lose. It traversed Indiana, 
                Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey like a flash, rushing through 
                towns with antique names, some of which had streets and car-tracks, 
                but as yet no houses. At last the Hudson came into view; and, 
                at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th, the train 
                stopped in the station on the right bank of the river, before 
                the very pier of the Cunard line. </p>
              <p>　　The China, for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an 
                hour before! </p>

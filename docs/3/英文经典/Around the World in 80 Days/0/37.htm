              <p><b>　　IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT PHILEAS FOGG GAINED NOTHING BY 
                HIS TOUR AROUND THE WORLD, UNLESS IT WERE HAPPINESS</b> </p>
              <p>　　 Yes; Phileas Fogg in person. </p>
              <p>　　The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in 
                the evening-- about five and twenty hours after the arrival of 
                the travellers in London-- Passepartout had been sent by his master 
                to engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain 
                marriage ceremony, which was to take place the next day. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout went on his errand enchanted. He soon reached 
                the clergyman's house, but found him not at home. Passepartout 
                waited a good twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend gentleman, 
                it was thirty-five minutes past eight. But in what a state he 
                was! With his hair in disorder, and without his hat, he ran along 
                the street as never man was seen to run before, overturning passers-by, 
                rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout. </p>
              <p>　　In three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered 
                back into Mr. Fogg's room. </p>
              <p>　　He could not speak. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is the matter?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;My master!&quot; gasped Passepartout--&quot;marriage--impossible--&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Impossible?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Impossible--for to-morrow.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why so?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Because to-morrow--is Sunday!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Monday,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No--to-day is Saturday.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Saturday? Impossible!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, yes, yes, yes!&quot; cried Passepartout. &quot;You 
                have made a mistake of one day! We arrived twenty-four hours ahead 
                of time; but there are only ten minutes left!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was dragging 
                him along with irresistible force. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, 
                left his house, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to 
                the cabman, and, having run over two dogs and overturned five 
                carriages, reached the Reform Club. </p>
              <p>　　The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared 
                in the great saloon. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in 
                eighty days! </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds! </p>
              <p>　　How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made 
                this error of a day? How came he to think that he had arrived 
                in London on Saturday, the twenty-first day of December, when 
                it was really Friday, the twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only 
                from his departure? </p>
              <p>　　The cause of the error is very simple. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on 
                his journey, and this merely because he had travelled constantly 
                eastward; he would, on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone 
                in the opposite direction, that is, westward. </p>
              <p>　　In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the 
                days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as 
                he crossed degrees in this direction. There are three hundred 
                and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these 
                three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives 
                precisely twenty-four hours--that is, the day unconsciously gained. 
                In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun 
                pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw 
                it pass the meridian seventy-nine times. This is why they awaited 
                him at the Reform Club on Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg 
                thought. </p>
              <p>　　And Passepartout's famous family watch, which had always kept 
                London time, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the 
                days as well as the hours and the minutes! </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, 
                as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary 
                gain was small. His object was, however, to be victorious, and 
                not to win money. He divided the one thousand pounds that remained 
                between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix, against whom he 
                cherished no grudge. He deducted, however, from Passepartout's 
                share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen 
                hundred and twenty hours, for the sake of regularity. </p>
              <p>　　That evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, 
                said to Aouda: &quot;Is our marriage still agreeable to you?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Mr. Fogg,&quot; replied she, &quot;it is for me to ask 
                that question. You were ruined, but now you are rich again.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Pardon me, madam; my fortune belongs to you. If you had 
                not suggested our marriage, my servant would not have gone to 
                the Reverend Samuel Wilson's, I should not have been apprised 
                of my error, and--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Dear Mr. Fogg!&quot; said the young woman. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Dear Aouda!&quot; replied Phileas Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight 
                hours after, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave 
                the bride away. Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled 
                to this honour? </p>
              <p>　　The next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped 
                vigorously at his master's door. Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, 
                &quot;What's the matter, Passepartout?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is it, sir? Why, I've just this instant found out--&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That we might have made the tour of the world in only 
                seventy-eight days.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No doubt,&quot; returned Mr. Fogg, &quot;by not crossing 
                India. But if I had not crossed India, I should not have saved 
                Aouda; she would not have been my wife, and--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg quietly shut the door. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around 
                the world in eighty days. To do this he had employed every means 
                of conveyance--steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels, 
                sledges, elephants. The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed 
                all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude. But what 
                then? What had he really gained by all this trouble? What had 
                he brought back from this long and weary journey? </p>
              <p>　　Nothing, say you? Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, 
                who, strange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men! </p>
              <p>　　Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around 
                the world? </p>

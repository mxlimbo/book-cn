              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS VENTURE ACROSS 
                THE INDIAN FORESTS, AND WHAT ENSUED </b></p>
              <p>　　 In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left 
                of the line where the railway was still in process of being built. 
                This line, owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, 
                did not pursue a straight course. The Parsee, who was quite familiar 
                with the roads and paths in the district, declared that they would 
                gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck 
                in the peculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled 
                by the swift trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by 
                the skilful Parsee; but they endured the discomfort with true 
                British phlegm, talking little, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse 
                of each other. As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's 
                back, and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod 
                along, he was very careful, in accordance with his master's advice, 
                to keep his tongue from between his teeth, as it would otherwise 
                have been bitten off short. The worthy fellow bounced from the 
                elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; 
                yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing, and from time to 
                time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and inserted it 
                in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in the least slackening 
                his regular trot. </p>
              <p>　　After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him 
                an hour for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst 
                at a neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs 
                round about him. Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the 
                delay, and both descended with a feeling of relief. &quot;Why, 
                he's made of iron!&quot; exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly 
                on Kiouni. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Of forged iron,&quot; replied Passepartout, as he set 
                about preparing a hasty breakfast. </p>
              <p>　　At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country 
                soon presented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms 
                succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with 
                scanty shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite. All this 
                portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, 
                is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible 
                practices of the Hindoo faith. The English have not been able 
                to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is subjected 
                to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach 
                in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses. The travellers several 
                times saw bands of ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived 
                the elephant striding across-country, made angry arid threatening 
                motions. The Parsee avoided them as much as possible. Few animals 
                were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their 
                path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout 
                with laughter. </p>
              <p>　　In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the 
                worthy servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when 
                he got to Allahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! 
                The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. 
                Would he sell him, or set him free? The estimable beast certainly 
                deserved some consideration. Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, 
                Passepartout, a present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; 
                and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in 
                the evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, 
                in a ruined bungalow. They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that 
                day, and an equal distance still separated them from the station 
                of Allahabad. </p>
              <p>　　The night was cold. The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with 
                a few dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions 
                purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate 
                ravenously. The conversation, beginning with a few disconnected 
                phrases, soon gave place to loud and steady snores. The guide 
                watched Kiouni, who slept standing, bolstering himself against 
                the trunk of a large tree. Nothing occurred during the night to 
                disturb the slumberers, although occasional growls front panthers 
                and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable 
                beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants 
                of the bungalow. Sir Francis slept heavily, like an honest soldier 
                overcome with fatigue. Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams 
                of the bouncing of the day before. As for Mr. Fogg, he slumbered 
                as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville 
                Row. </p>
              <p>　　The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped 
                to reach Allahabad by evening. In that case, Mr. Fogg would only 
                lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning 
                of the tour. Kiouni, resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the 
                lower spurs of the Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the 
                village of Kallenger, on the Cani, one of the branches of the 
                Ganges. The guide avoided inhabited places, thinking it safer 
                to keep the open country, which lies along the first depressions 
                of the basin of the great river. Allahabad was now only twelve 
                miles to the north-east. They stopped under a clump of bananas, 
                the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream, 
                was amply partaken of and appreciated. </p>
              <p>　　At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended 
                several miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods. 
                They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey 
                seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished, when the 
                elephant, becoming restless, suddenly stopped. </p>
              <p>　　It was then four o'clock. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked Sir Francis, putting out 
                his head. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I don't know, officer,&quot; replied the Parsee, listening 
                attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick 
                branches. </p>
              <p>　　The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a 
                distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments. 
                Passepartout was all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg patiently waited 
                without a word. The Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the 
                elephant to a tree, and plunged into the thicket. He soon returned, 
                saying: </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A procession of Brahmins is coming this way. We must 
                prevent their seeing us, if possible.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, 
                at the same time asking the travellers not to stir. He held himself 
                ready to bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight 
                become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession 
                of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick 
                foliage, in which they were wholly concealed. </p>
              <p>　　The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, 
                and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines 
                and cymbals. The head of the procession soon appeared beneath 
                the trees, a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed 
                the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches. 
                First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed 
                in long lace robes. They were surrounded by men, women, and children, 
                who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals 
                by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a 
                car with large wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents 
                entwined with each other. Upon the car, which was drawn by four 
                richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, 
                the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, 
                protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel. It stood upright 
                upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant. </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, &quot;The goddess 
                Kali; the goddess of love and death.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Of death, perhaps,&quot; muttered back Passepartout, 
                &quot;but of love-- that ugly old hag? Never!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The Parsee made a motion to keep silence. </p>
              <p>　　A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round 
                the statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts 
                whence their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics, who, 
                in the great Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the 
                wheels of Juggernaut. Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness 
                of Oriental apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every 
                step, followed. This woman was young, and as fair as a European. 
                Her head and neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were 
                loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets, earrings, and 
                rings; while a tunic bordered with gold, and covered with a light 
                muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her form. </p>
              <p>　　The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent 
                contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at 
                their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse 
                on a palanquin. It was the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed 
                in the habiliments of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered 
                with pearls, a robe of tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere 
                sewed with diamonds, and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince. 
                Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose 
                cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments; these closed 
                the procession. </p>
              <p>　　Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, 
                and, turning to the guide, said, &quot;A suttee.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The procession 
                slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared 
                in the depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally 
                cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence 
                again. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon 
                as the procession had disappeared, asked: &quot;What is a suttee?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A suttee,&quot; returned the general, &quot;is a human 
                sacrifice, but a voluntary one. The woman you have just seen will 
                be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Oh, the scoundrels!&quot; cried Passepartout, who could 
                not repress his indignation. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And the corpse?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is that of the prince, her husband,&quot; said the guide; 
                &quot;an independent rajah of Bundelcund.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is it possible,&quot; resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice 
                betraying not the least emotion, &quot;that these barbarous customs 
                still exist in India, and that the English have been unable to 
                put a stop to them?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of 
                India,&quot; replied Sir Francis; &quot;but we have no power over 
                these savage territories, and especially here in Bundelcund. The 
                whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant 
                murders and pillage.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The poor wretch!&quot; exclaimed Passepartout, &quot;to 
                be burned alive!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Sir Francis, &quot;burned alive. 
                And, if she were not, you cannot conceive what treatment she would 
                be obliged to submit to from her relatives. They would shave off 
                her hair, feed her on a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with 
                contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature, and 
                would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog. The prospect of so 
                frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice 
                much more than love or religious fanaticism. Sometimes, however, 
                the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires the active 
                interference of the Government to prevent it. Several years ago, 
                when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of 
                the governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, 
                as you may imagine, he refused. The woman left the town, took 
                refuge with an independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted 
                purpose.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several 
                times, and now said: &quot;The sacrifice which will take place 
                to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;How do you know?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any 
                resistance,&quot; observed Sir Francis. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes 
                of hemp and opium.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But where are they taking her?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will 
                pass the night there.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And the sacrifice will take place--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped 
                upon his neck. Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni 
                forward with a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning 
                to Sir Francis Cromarty, said, &quot;Suppose we save this woman.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Save the woman, Mr. Fogg!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I have yet twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to 
                that.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why, you are a man of heart!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sometimes,&quot; replied Phileas Fogg, quietly; &quot;when 
                I have the time.&quot;</p>

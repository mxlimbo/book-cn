              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD 
                </b> </p>
              <p>　　 &quot;From ocean to ocean&quot;--so say the Americans; and 
                these four words compose the general designation of the &quot;great 
                trunk line&quot; which crosses the entire width of the United 
                States. The Pacific Railroad is, however, really divided into 
                two distinct lines: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco 
                and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five 
                main lines connect Omaha with New York. </p>
              <p>　　New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted 
                metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven 
                hundred and eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the 
                railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians 
                and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they 
                were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonise. </p>
              <p>　　The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, 
                under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It 
                is now accomplished in seven days. </p>
              <p>　　It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, 
                who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road 
                between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President 
                Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska. 
                The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American 
                energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously 
                affect its good execution. The road grew, on the prairies, a mile 
                and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails laid down 
                the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow, 
                and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position. </p>
              <p>　　The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, 
                Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along 
                the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its 
                northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie 
                territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, 
                and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the 
                Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt 
                Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, via Sacramento, to 
                the Pacific--its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding 
                one hundred and twelve feet to the mile. </p>
              <p>　　Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would 
                enable Phileas Fogg--at least, so he hoped--to take the Atlantic 
                steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool. </p>
              <p>　　The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight 
                wheels, and with no compartments in the interior. It was supplied 
                with two rows of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the 
                train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front 
                and rear platforms. These platforms were found throughout the 
                train, and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the 
                train to the other. It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony 
                cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars; theatre cars alone were wanting, 
                and they will have these some day. </p>
              <p>　　Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and 
                cigars, who seemed to have plenty of customers, were continually 
                circulating in the aisles. </p>
              <p>　　The train left Oakland station at six o'clock. It was already 
                night, cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds 
                which seemed to threaten snow. The train did not proceed rapidly; 
                counting the stoppages, it did not run more than twenty miles 
                an hour, which was a sufficient speed, however, to enable it to 
                reach Omaha within its designated time. </p>
              <p>　　There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many 
                of the passengers were overcome with sleep. Passepartout found 
                himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him. After 
                recent events, their relations with each other had grown somewhat 
                cold; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between 
                them. Fix's manner had not changed; but Passepartout was very 
                reserved, and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest 
                provocation. </p>
              <p>　　Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, 
                however, which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could 
                be seen from the windows but a vast, white sheet, against which 
                the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect. </p>
              <p>　　At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that 
                the time for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the 
                car was transformed into a dormitory. The backs of the seats were 
                thrown back, bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an 
                ingenious system, berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller 
                had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed, protected from 
                curious eyes by thick curtains. The sheets were clean and the 
                pillows soft. It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody 
                did-- while the train sped on across the State of California. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very 
                hilly. The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, 
                extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha. The line from San 
                Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along 
                the American River, which empties into San Pablo Bay. The one 
                hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished 
                in six hours, and towards midnight, while fast asleep, the travellers 
                passed through Sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important 
                place, the seat of the State government, with its fine quays, 
                its broad streets, its noble hotels, squares, and churches. </p>
              <p>　　The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, 
                Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada. 
                'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later 
                the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers 
                could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region 
                through which they were steaming. The railway track wound in and 
                out among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now 
                suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves, 
                plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet. 
                The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with 
                its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled 
                its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, 
                and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines. 
              </p>
              <p>　　There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The railway 
                turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt 
                to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to 
                another. </p>
              <p>　　The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley 
                about nine o'clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday 
                reached Reno, where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast. 
              </p>
              <p>　　From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed 
                northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, 
                and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly 
                at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada. </p>
              <p>　　Having breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their 
                places in the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded 
                itself as they passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining 
                the horizon, and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams. 
                Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, 
                seemed like a moveable dam. These innumerable multitudes of ruminating 
                beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of 
                the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the 
                track for hours together, in compact ranks. The locomotive is 
                then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear. 
              </p>
              <p>　　This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. 
                About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of 
                buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, 
                tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals 
                was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, 
                uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of 
                interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing 
                can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living 
                flesh which no dam could contain. </p>
              <p>　　The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; 
                but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, 
                remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should 
                please the buffaloes to get out of the way. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and 
                longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What a country!&quot; cried he. &quot;Mere cattle stop 
                the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not 
                impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw 
                this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't 
                dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was 
                wise. He would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with 
                the cow-catcher; but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon 
                have been checked, the train would inevitably have been thrown 
                off the track, and would then have been helpless. </p>
              <p>　　The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost 
                time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed. The procession 
                of buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before 
                the track was clear. The last ranks of the herd were now passing 
                over the rails, while the first had already disappeared below 
                the southern horizon. </p>
              <p>　　It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles 
                of the Humboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah, 
                the region of the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the 
                Mormons.</p>

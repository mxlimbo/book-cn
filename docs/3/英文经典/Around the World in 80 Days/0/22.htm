              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT, EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES, 
                IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET </b></p>
              <p>　　 The Carnatic, setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six 
                on the 7th of November, directed her course at full steam towards 
                Japan. She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers. 
                Two state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied--those which 
                had been engaged by Phileas Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering 
                gait, and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second 
                cabin, and to totter to a seat on deck. </p>
              <p>　　It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows: 
                Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the 
                unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved 
                for the smokers. Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams 
                by a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against 
                the stupefying influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty 
                unfulfilled shook off his torpor, and he hurried from the abode 
                of drunkenness. Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against 
                the walls, falling down and creeping up again, and irresistibly 
                impelled by a kind of instinct, he kept crying out, &quot;The 
                Carnatic! the Carnatic!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of 
                starting. Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon 
                the plank, he crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just 
                as the Carnatic was moving off. Several sailors, who were evidently 
                accustomed to this sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down 
                into the second cabin, and Passepartout did not wake until they 
                were one hundred and fifty miles away from China. Thus he found 
                himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly 
                inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze. The pure air sobered him. 
                He began to collect his sense, which he found a difficult task; 
                but at last he recalled the events of the evening before, Fix's 
                revelation, and the opium-house. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is evident,&quot; said he to himself, &quot;that I 
                have been abominably drunk! What will Mr. Fogg say? At least I 
                have not missed the steamer, which is the most important thing.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　Then, as Fix occurred to him: &quot;As for that rascal, I hope 
                we are well rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, 
                to follow us on board the Carnatic. A detective on the track of 
                Mr. Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg 
                is no more a robber than I am a murderer.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Should he divulge Fix's real errand to his master? Would it 
                do to tell the part the detective was playing. Would it not be 
                better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart 
                to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following 
                him round the world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt; 
                at least, it was worth considering. The first thing to do was 
                to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise for his singular behaviour. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with 
                the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who 
                resembled either his master or Aouda. &quot;Good!&quot; muttered 
                he; &quot;Aouda has not got up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably 
                found some partners at whist.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　He descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout 
                had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master's 
                state-room. The purser replied that he did not know any passenger 
                by the name of Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Passepartout persistently. 
                &quot;He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and 
                has with him a young lady--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;There is no young lady on board,&quot; interrupted the 
                purser. &quot;Here is a list of the passengers; you may see for 
                yourself.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not 
                upon it. All at once an idea struck him. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah! am I on the Carnatic?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;On the way to Yokohama?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Certainly.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong 
                boat; but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was 
                not there. </p>
              <p>　　He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered 
                that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have 
                informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so. 
                It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the 
                steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, 
                in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter 
                at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He now saw 
                the detective's trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly 
                ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and 
                imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair. Ah, if 
                Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts there 
                would be! </p>
              <p>　　After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and 
                began to study his situation. It was certainly not an enviable 
                one. He found himself on the way to Japan, and what should he 
                do when he got there? His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary 
                shilling not so much as a penny. His passage had fortunately been 
                paid for in advance; and he had five or six days in which to decide 
                upon his future course. He fell to at meals with an appetite, 
                and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself. He helped himself as 
                generously as if Japan were a desert, where nothing to eat was 
                to be looked for. </p>
              <p>　　At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama. 
                This is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the 
                mail-steamers, and those carrying travellers between North America, 
                China, Japan, and the Oriental islands put in. It is situated 
                in the bay of Yeddo, and at but a short distance from that second 
                capital of the Japanese Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, 
                the civil Emperor, before the Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed 
                his office in his own. The Carnatic anchored at the quay near 
                the custom-house, in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the 
                flags of all nations. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory 
                of the Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking 
                chance for his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets 
                of Yokohama. He found himself at first in a thoroughly European 
                quarter, the houses having low fronts, and being adorned with 
                verandas, beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles. 
                This quarter occupied, with its streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, 
                all the space between the &quot;promontory of the Treaty&quot; 
                and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and Calcutta, were mixed 
                crowds of all races Americans and English, Chinamen and Dutchmen, 
                mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything. The Frenchman 
                felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down 
                in the midst of Hottentots. </p>
              <p>　　He had, at least, one resource to call on the French and English 
                consuls at Yokohama for assistance. But he shrank from telling 
                the story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with 
                that of his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust 
                all other means of aid. As chance did not favour him in the European 
                quarter, he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, 
                determined, if necessary, to push on to Yeddo. </p>
              <p>　　The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the 
                goddess of the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about. 
                There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred 
                gates of a singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst 
                of bamboos and reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy 
                retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of 
                Confucius, and interminable streets, where a perfect harvest of 
                rose-tinted and red-cheeked children, who looked as if they had 
                been cut out of Japanese screens, and who were playing in the 
                midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats, might have been 
                gathered. </p>
              <p>　　The streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing 
                in processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house 
                officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two 
                sabres hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with 
                white stripes, and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards, enveloped 
                in silken doubles, hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of 
                military folk of all ranks--for the military profession is as 
                much respected in Japan as it is despised in China--went hither 
                and thither in groups and pairs. Passepartout saw, too, begging 
                friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple civilians, with their 
                warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts, slender legs, 
                short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour to a 
                dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the 
                Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe the curious 
                equipages--carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, 
                and litters made of bamboo; nor the women-- whom he thought not 
                especially handsome--who took little steps with their little feet, 
                whereon they wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked 
                wood, and who displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth 
                fashionably blackened, and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied 
                in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian 
                ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan. </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this 
                motley crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious 
                shops, the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese 
                ornaments, the restaurants decked with streamers and banners, 
                the tea-houses, where the odorous beverage was being drunk with 
                saki, a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice, and the 
                comfortable smoking-houses, where they were puffing, not opium, 
                which is almost unknown in Japan, but a very fine, stringy tobacco. 
                He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the midst of 
                vast rice plantations. There he saw dazzling camellias expanding 
                themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours 
                and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within bamboo enclosures, 
                cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather 
                for their blossoms than their fruit, and which queerly-fashioned, 
                grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows, pigeons, ravens, 
                and other voracious birds. On the branches of the cedars were 
                perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows 
                were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were 
                crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which 
                the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise 
                long life and prosperity. </p>
              <p>　　As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets 
                among the shrubs. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good!&quot; said he; &quot;I'll have some supper.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No chance there,&quot; thought he. </p>
              <p>　　The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty 
                a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he 
                had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming 
                importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither 
                mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege 
                to kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made 
                up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama-- nor 
                was he mistaken; and, in default of butcher's meat, he could have 
                wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some 
                quails, some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat 
                almost exclusively. But he found it necessary to keep up a stout 
                heart, and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning. 
                Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter, where 
                he wandered through the streets, lit by vari-coloured lanterns, 
                looking on at the dancers, who were executing skilful steps and 
                boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open air with 
                their telescopes. Then he came to the harbour, which was lit up 
                by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their 
                boats. </p>
              <p>　　The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers 
                of which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their 
                suites, Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded 
                the bustling crowd. Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, 
                and said to himself: &quot;Good! another Japanese embassy departing 
                for Europe!&quot; </p>

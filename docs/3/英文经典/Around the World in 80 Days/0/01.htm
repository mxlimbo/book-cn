              <p><b>　　IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER, 
                THE ONE AS MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN </b></p>
              <p>　　 Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington 
                Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one 
                of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed 
                always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, 
                about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man 
                of the world. People said that he resembled Byron--at least that 
                his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who 
                might live on a thousand years without growing old. </p>
              <p>　　Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas 
                Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the 
                Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the &quot;City&quot;; no ships 
                ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had 
                no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the 
                Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's 
                Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, 
                or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the Ecclesiastical 
                Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant 
                or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific 
                and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in 
                the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London 
                Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of 
                Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous 
                societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic 
                to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of 
                abolishing pernicious insects. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was 
                simple enough. </p>
              <p>　　He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open 
                credit. His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account 
                current, which was always flush. </p>
              <p>　　Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him 
                best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg 
                was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was 
                not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he 
                knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent 
                purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He 
                was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very 
                little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. 
                His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever 
                he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, 
                that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled. </p>
              <p>　　Had he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know 
                the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that 
                he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He 
                often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures 
                advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, 
                pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted 
                with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. 
                He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit. </p>
              <p>　　It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented 
                himself from London for many years. Those who were honoured by 
                a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody 
                could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes 
                were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this 
                game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but 
                his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund 
                for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake 
                of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with 
                a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial 
                to his tastes. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, 
                which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or 
                near friends, which is certainly more unusual. He lived alone 
                in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated. A single 
                domestic sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and dined at the 
                club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the 
                same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less 
                bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, 
                only to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy chambers 
                which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed 
                ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping 
                or making his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with 
                a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, 
                or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red 
                porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. 
                When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its 
                kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his 
                table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest 
                waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered 
                the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club 
                decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and 
                his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly 
                cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes. 
              </p>
              <p>　　If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed 
                that there is something good in eccentricity. </p>
              <p>　　The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly 
                comfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand 
                but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him 
                to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd 
                of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless 
                youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit 
                instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who 
                was due at the house between eleven and half-past. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet 
                close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands 
                resting on his knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was 
                steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, 
                the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years. 
                At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily 
                habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform. </p>
              <p>　　A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment 
                where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed 
                servant, appeared. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;The new servant,&quot; said he. </p>
              <p>　　A young man of thirty advanced and bowed. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are a Frenchman, I believe,&quot; asked Phileas Fogg, 
                &quot;and your name is John?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Jean, if monsieur pleases,&quot; replied the newcomer, 
                &quot;Jean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because 
                I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another. 
                I believe I'm honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had 
                several trades. I've been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, 
                when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin. 
                Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to make better 
                use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, 
                and assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years 
                ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service 
                as a valet here in England. Finding myself out of place, and hearing 
                that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman 
                in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of 
                living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the name 
                of Passepartout.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Passepartout suits me,&quot; responded Mr. Fogg. &quot;You 
                are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you. You know 
                my conditions?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Good! What time is it?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Twenty-two minutes after eleven,&quot; returned Passepartout, 
                drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are too slow,&quot; said Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are four minutes too slow. No matter; it's enough 
                to mention the error. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes 
                after eleven, a.m., this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my 
                service.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it 
                on his head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new 
                master going out. He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, 
                James Forster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone 
                in the house in Saville Row. </p>

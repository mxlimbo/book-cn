              <p><b>　　IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG </b></p>
              <p>　　 While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg, 
                unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was 
                quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, 
                making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them. 
                It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the 
                tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected 
                to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his 
                task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the 
                remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience 
                and generosity: </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they 
                dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, 
                shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired 
                to her room for rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the 
                evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would 
                have been not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing 
                that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next 
                morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter. When Passepartout 
                did not appear the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. 
                Fogg, not betraying the least vexation, contented himself with 
                taking his carpet-bag, calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then 
                high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and 
                Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after 
                on a wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay 
                whence they were to embark. Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic 
                had sailed the evening before. He had expected to find not only 
                the steamer, but his domestic, and was forced to give up both; 
                but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely 
                remarked to Aouda, &quot;It is an accident, madam; nothing more.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively 
                approached. It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: &quot;Were 
                you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived 
                yesterday?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I was, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Fogg coldly. &quot;But 
                I have not the honour--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Do you know where he is, sir?&quot; asked Aouda anxiously. 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;What!&quot; responded Fix, feigning surprise. &quot;Is 
                he not with you?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Aouda. &quot;He has not made his appearance 
                since yesterday. Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without 
                us?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Without you, madam?&quot; answered the detective. &quot;Excuse 
                me, did you intend to sail in the Carnatic?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The 
                Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours 
                before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we 
                must now wait a week for another steamer.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　As he said &quot;a week&quot; Fix felt his heart leap for joy. 
                Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for 
                the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative 
                of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg 
                say, in his placid voice, &quot;But there are other vessels besides 
                the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward 
                the docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, 
                followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible 
                thread. Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the 
                man it had hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg 
                wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, 
                to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only 
                find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could 
                not therefore set sail. Fix began to hope again. </p>
              <p>　　But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his 
                search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when 
                he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Is your honour looking for a boat?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Have you a boat ready to sail?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat--No. 43--the best in the 
                harbour.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Does she go fast?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look 
                at her?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea 
                excursion?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No; for a voyage.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;A voyage?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and 
                said, &quot;Is your honour joking?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;No. I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama 
                by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am sorry,&quot; said the sailor; &quot;but it is impossible.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional 
                reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Are you in earnest?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very much so.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, 
                evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and 
                the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense. </p>
              <p>　　Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, &quot;You would not 
                be afraid, would you, madam?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Not with you, Mr. Fogg,&quot; was her answer. </p>
              <p>　　The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, pilot?&quot; said Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well, your honour,&quot; replied he, &quot;I could not 
                risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons 
                on so long a voyage at this time of year. Besides, we could not 
                reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles 
                from Hong Kong.&quot; &quot;Only sixteen hundred,&quot; said Mr. 
                Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's the same thing.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix breathed more freely. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; added the pilot, &quot;it might be arranged 
                another way.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　Fix ceased to breathe at all. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;How?&quot; asked Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, 
                or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. 
                In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the 
                Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents 
                run northward, and would aid us. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Pilot,&quot; said Mr. Fogg, &quot;I must take the American 
                steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot; returned the pilot. &quot;The San Francisco 
                steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and 
                Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;You are sure of that?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Perfectly.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And when does the boat leave Shanghai?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, 
                four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, 
                if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, 
                we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;And you could go--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard 
                and the sails put up.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Would you like some earnest-money?&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;If it would not put your honour out--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,&quot; added 
                Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, &quot;if you would like to take 
                advantage--&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.&quot; </p>
              <p>　　&quot;Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>　　&quot;But poor Passepartout?&quot; urged Aouda, who was much 
                disturbed by the servant's disappearance. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I shall do all I can to find him,&quot; replied Phileas 
                Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, 
                the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong 
                Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and 
                left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same 
                formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, 
                and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, 
                which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf. </p>
              <p>　　It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew 
                on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully 
                built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, 
                her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the 
                pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two 
                masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, 
                storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before 
                the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, 
                she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat 
                races. The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, 
                the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the 
                Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, 
                vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and 
                energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence 
                in the most timid. </p>
              <p>　　Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix 
                already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the 
                walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; 
                in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation 
                was confined, but neat. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,&quot; 
                said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding. </p>
              <p>　　The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting 
                by the kindness of Mr. Fogg. </p>
              <p>　　&quot;It's certain,&quot; thought he, &quot;though rascal as 
                he is, he is a polite one!&quot; </p>
              <p>　　The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes 
                past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast 
                a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. 
                Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps 
                of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this 
                direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory 
                to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, 
                and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence 
                of the opium. </p>
              <p>　　John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and 
                the Tankadere, taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, 
                and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves. </p>

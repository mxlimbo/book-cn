          <td>That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening, 
            the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to northeast, and brought 
            rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could hardly 
            imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and 
            crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the 
            young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary, 
            and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept 
            his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into 
            a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child 
            laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the 
            still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door 
            opened, and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger 
            was greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of 
            the maids, and I cried-- 
            <p>`Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here? What would Mr 
              Linton say if he heard you?' </p>
            <p>`Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice; `but I know Edgar is in 
              bed, and I cannot stop myself.' </p>
            <p>With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding 
              her hand to her side. </p>
            <p>`I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!' she continued, 
              after a pause; `except where I've flown. I couldn't count the number 
              of falls I've had. Oh, I'm aching all over! Don't be alarmed! There 
              shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have 
              the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to 
              Gimmerton, and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.' 
            </p>
            <p>The intruder was Mrs Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing 
              predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow 
              and water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, 
              befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short 
              sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light 
              silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely 
              by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only 
              the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched 
              and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself, through 
              fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed 
              when I had had leisure to examine her. </p>
            <p>`My dear young lady,' I exclaimed, `I'll stir nowhere, and hear 
              nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and 
              put on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton tonight, 
              so it is needless to order the carriage.' </p>
            <p>`Certainly, I shall,' she said; `walking or riding: yet I've no 
              objection to dress myself decently. And--ah, see how it flows down 
              my neck now! The fire does make it smart.' </p>
            <p>She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would 
              let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed 
              to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did 
              I obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change 
              her garments. </p>
            <p>`Now, Ellen,' she said, when my task was finished and she was seated 
              in an easy chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, you 
              sit down opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't 
              like to see it! You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because 
              I behaved so foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly--yes, 
              more than anyone else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, 
              you remember, and I shan't forgive myself. But, for all that, I 
              was not going to sympathize with him--the brute beast! Oh, give 
              me the poker! This is the last thing of his I have about me.' She 
              slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the 
              floor. `I'll smash it!' she continued, striking it with childish 
              spite, `and then I'll burn it!' and she took and dropped the misused 
              article among the coals. `There! he shall buy another, if he gets 
              me back again. He'd be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. 
              I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head! 
              And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he? And I won't come suing 
              for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble. Necessity 
              compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned 
              he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my 
              face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed 
              again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed--of that incarnate 
              goblin! Ah! he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It's a pity 
              Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn't have run till 
              I'd seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!' 
            </p>
            <p>`Well, don't talk so fast, miss!' I interrupted; `you'll disorder 
              the handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed 
              again. Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: 
              laughter is sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!' 
            </p>
            <p>`An undeniable truth,' she replied. `Listen to that child! It maintains 
              a constant wail--send it out of my hearing for an hour; I shan't 
              stay any longer.' </p>
            <p>I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then 
              I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in 
              such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused 
              remaining with us. </p>
            <p>`I ought, and I wish to remain,' answered she, `to cheer Edgar 
              and take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange 
              is my right home. But I Bell you he wouldn't let me! Do you think 
              he could bear to see me grow fat and merry; and could bear to think 
              that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? 
              Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to 
              the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot 
              or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of 
              his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of 
              hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have 
              to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion. 
              It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would 
              not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape; 
              and therefore I must get quite away. I've recovered from my first 
              desire to be killed by him: I'd rather he'd kill himself! He has 
              extinguished my love effectually, and so I'm at my ease. I can recollect 
              yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be 
              loving him, if--no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the devilish 
              nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine had 
              an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him 
              so well. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, 
              and out of my memory!' </p>
            <p>`Hush, hush! He's a human being,' I said. `Be more charitable: 
              there are worse men than he is yet!' </p>
            <p>`He's not a human being,' she retorted; `and he has no claim on 
              my charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, 
              and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and 
              since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and 
              I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept 
              tears of blood for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!' And 
              here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from 
              her lashes, she recommenced. `You asked, what has driven me to flight 
              at last? I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded 
              in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the 
              nerves with red-hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking 
              on the head. He was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he 
              boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I experienced pleasure 
              in being able to exasperate him; the sense of pleasure woke my instinct 
              of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come 
              into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge. </p>
            <p>`Yesterday, you know, Mr Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. 
              He kept himself sober for the purpose--tolerably sober: not going 
              to bed mad at six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently 
              he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a 
              dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or 
              brandy by tumblerfuls. </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff--I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the 
              house from last Sunday till today. Whether the angels have fed him, 
              or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with 
              us for nearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs 
              to his chamber; locking himself in--as if anybody dreamt of coveting 
              his company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only 
              the deity he implored in senseless dust and ashes; and God, when 
              addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father! After 
              concluding these precious orisons--and they lasted generally till 
              he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat--he would 
              be off again; always straight down to the Grange! I-wonder Edgar 
              did not send for a constable, and give him into custody! For me, 
              grieved as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding 
              this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday. 
            </p>
            <p>`I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph's eternal lectures 
              without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the 
              foot of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn't think that 
              I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are 
              detestable companions. I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his 
              awful talk, than with ``t' little maister'' and his staunch supporter, 
              that odious old man! When Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to 
              seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited 
              chambers; when he is not, as was the case this week, I establish 
              a table and chair at one comer of the house fire, and never mind 
              how Mr Earnshaw may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with 
              my arrangements. He is quieter now than he used to be, if no one 
              provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less furious. Joseph 
              affirms he's sure he's an altered man: that the Lord has touched 
              his heart, and he is saved ``so as by fire''. I'm puzzled to detect 
              signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business. </p>
            <p>`Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late 
              on towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the 
              wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting 
              to the kirkyard and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes 
              from the page before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped 
              its place. Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps 
              meditating on the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point 
              below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two 
              or three hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning 
              wind, which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling 
              of the coals, and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals 
              the long wick of the candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast 
              asleep in bed. It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, 
              for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to 
              be restored. </p>
            <p>`The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen 
              latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; 
              owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, 
              and we beard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with 
              an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced 
              my companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and 
              look at me. </p>
            <p>``I'Il keep him out five minutes,'' he exclaimed. ``You won't object?'' 
            </p>
            <p>`&quot;No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,'' I answered. 
              ``Do! put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.'' </p>
            <p>`Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he 
              then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning 
              over it, and searching in my eyes, a sympathy with the burning hate 
              that gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, 
              he couldn't exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage 
              him to speak. </p>
            <p>`&quot;You and I'', he said, ``have each a great debt to settle 
              with the man out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might 
              combine to discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you 
              willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?'' 
            </p>
            <p>``I'm weary of enduring now,'' I replied; ``and I'd be glad of 
              a retaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and 
              violence are spears pointed at both ends: they wound those who resort 
              to them worse than their enemies.'' </p>
            <p>``Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!'' 
              cried Hindley. ``Mrs Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing; but 
              sit still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I'm sure you would 
              have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend's 
              existence; he'll be your death unless you overreach him; and he'll 
              be my ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if 
              he were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before 
              that clock strikes--it wants three minutes of one--you're a free 
              woman!'' </p>
            <p>`He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from 
              his breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it 
              away, however, and seized his arm. </p>
            <p>` ``I'Il not hold my tongue!'' I said; ``you mustn't touch him. 
              Let the door remain shut, and be quiet!'' </p>
            <p>` ``No! I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!'' 
              cried the desperate being. ``I'Il do you a kindness in spite of 
              yourself, and Hareton justice! And you needn't trouble your head 
              to screen me; Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or 
              be ashamed, though I cut my throat this minute--and it's time to 
              make an end!'' </p>
            <p>`I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a 
              lunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn 
              his intended victim of the fate which awaited him. </p>
            <p>`&quot;You'd better seek shelter somewhere else tonight!'' I exclaimed 
              in a rather triumphant tone. ``Mr Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, 
              if you persist in endeavouring to enter.'' </p>
            <p>``You'd better open the door, you--&quot;he answered, addressing 
              me by some elegant term that I don't care to repeat. </p>
            <p>``I shall not meddle in the matter,'' I retorted again. ``Come 
              in and get shot, if you please! I've done my duty.'' </p>
            <p>`With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; 
              having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any 
              anxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately 
              at me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all 
              sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret 
              heart (and conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing 
              it would be for him should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and 
              what a blessing for me should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! 
              As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement behind me was banged 
              on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual, and his black 
              countenance liked blightingly through. The stanchions stood too 
              close to suffer his shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting 
              in my fancied security. His hair and clothes were whitened with 
              snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, 
              gleamed through the dark. </p>
            <p>`&quot;Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!'' he ``girned'', 
              as Joseph calls it. </p>
            <p>I cannot commit murder,'' I replied. ``Mr Hindley stands sentinel 
              with a knife and loaded pistol.'' </p>
            <p>``Let me in by the kitchen door,'' he said. </p>
            <p>``Hindley will be there before you,'' I answered: ``and that's 
              a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were 
              left at peace on our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but 
              the moment a blast of winter returns, you must run for shelter! 
              Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go stretch myself over her grave 
              and die like a faithful dog. The world is surely not worth living 
              in now, is it? You had distinctly impressed on me the idea that 
              Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can't imagine how you 
              think of surviving her loss.'' </p>
            <p>``He's there, is he?'' exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. 
              ``If I can get my arm out I can hit him!'' </p>
            <p>`I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you 
              don't know all, so don't judge. I wouldn't have aided or abetted 
              an attempt on even his life for anything. Wish that he were dead, 
              I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved 
              by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung 
              himself on Earnshaw's weapon and wrenched it from his grasp. </p>
            <p>`The charge,exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed 
              into its owners wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, 
              slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into 
              his pocket. He then took a stone, struck down the division between 
              two windows, and sprang in. His adversary had fallen senseless with 
              excessive pain and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery 
              or a large vein. The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed 
              his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand, 
              meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph. He exerted preterhuman 
              self-denial in abstaining from finishing him completely; but getting 
              out of breath he finally desisted, and dragged the apparently inanimate 
              body on to the settle. There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw's 
              coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and 
              cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before. 
              Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who, 
              having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried 
              below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once. </p>
            <p>``What is there to do, now? what is there to do, now?'' </p>
            <p>`&quot;There's this to do,'' thundered Heathcliff, ``that your 
              master's mad; and should he last another month, I'll have him to 
              an asylum. And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you 
              toothless hound? Don't stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, 
              I'm not going to nurse him. Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks 
              of your candle--it is more than half brandy!'' </p>
            <p>`&quot;And so, ye've been murthering on him?'' exclaimed Joseph, 
              lifting his hands and eyes in horror. ``If iver I seed a seeght 
              loike this! May the Lord-- -'' </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the 
              blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry 
              it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my 
              laughter from its odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind 
              to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors 
              show themselves at the foot of the gallows. </p>
            <p>`&quot;Oh, I forgot you,'' said the tyrant. ``You shall do that. 
              Down with you. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? 
              There, that is work fit for you!'' </p>
            <p>`He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, 
              who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose, vowing he 
              would set off for the Grange directly. Mr Linton was a magistrate, 
              and though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. 
              He was so obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it 
              expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken 
              place; standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly 
              delivered the account in answer to his questions. It required a 
              great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was 
              not the aggressor; especially with my hardly wrung replies. However, 
              Mr Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened 
              to administer a dose of spirits, and by their succour his master 
              presently regained motion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that 
              his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, 
              called him deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice 
              his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To 
              my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley 
              stretched himself on the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, 
              marvelling that I had escaped so easily. </p>
            <p>`This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, 
              Mr Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, 
              almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither 
              appeared inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold 
              on the table, I commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating 
              heartily, and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and 
              superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, 
              and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had 
              done, I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, 
              going round Earnshaw's seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him. 
            </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated 
              his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to 
              stone. His forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now 
              think so diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk 
              eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, 
              for the lashes were wet then; his lips devoid of their ferocious 
              sneer, and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it 
              been another, I would have covered my face in the presence of such 
              grief. In his case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to 
              insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't miss this chance of sticking in 
              a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight 
              of paying wrong for wrong. </p>
            <p>`Fie, fie, miss!' I interrupted. `One might suppose you had never 
              opened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely 
              that ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add 
              your torture to His!' </p>
            <p>`In general I'll allow that it would be, Ellen,' she continued; 
              `but what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have 
              a hand in it? I'd rather he suffered less, if I might cause his 
              sufferings and he might know that I was the cause. O, I owe him 
              so much. On only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, 
              if I may take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every 
              wrench of agony return a wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was 
              the first to injure, make him the first to implore pardon; and then--why 
              then, Ellen, I might show you some generosity. But it is utterly 
              impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive 
              him. Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, and asked 
              him how he was. </p>
            <p>``Not as ill as I wish,'' he replied. ``But leaving out my arm, 
              every inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion 
              of imps!'' </p>
            <p>`&quot;Yes, no wonder,'' was my next remark. ``Catherine used to 
              boast that she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that 
              certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It's 
              well people don't really rise from their grave, or, last night, 
              she might have witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised 
              and cut over your chest and shoulders?'' </p>
            <p>``I can't say,'' he answered: ``but what do you mean? Did he dare 
              to strike me when I was down?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He trampled on you and kicked you, and dashed you on the 
              ground,'' I whispered. ``And his mouth watered to tear you with 
              his teeth; because he's only half a man--not so much.'' </p>
            <p>`Mr Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual 
              foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything 
              around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed 
              their blackness through his features. </p>
            <p>`&quot;Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in 
              my last agony, I'd go to hell with joy,'' groaned the impatient 
              man, writhing to rise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of 
              his inadequacy for the struggle. </p>
            <p>`&quot;Nay, it's enough that he has murdered one of you,'' I observed 
              aloud. ``At the Grange, everyone knows your sister would have been 
              living now, had it not been for Mr Heathcliff. After all, it is 
              preferable to be hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy 
              we were--how happy Catherine was before he came--I'm fit to curse 
              the day.'' </p>
            <p>`Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, 
              than the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, 
              I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew 
              his breath in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed 
              scornfully. The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards 
              me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and 
              drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision. 
            </p>
            <p>``Get up, and begone out of my sight,'' said the mourner. </p>
            <p>`I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was 
              hardly intelligible. </p>
            <p>`&quot;I beg your pardon,'' I replied. ``But I loved Catherine 
              too; and her brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I 
              shall supply. Now that she's dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley 
              has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and 
              made them black and red; and her--'' </p>
            <p>``Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!'' he cried, 
              making a movement that caused me to make one also. </p>
            <p>``But then,'' I continued, holding myself ready to flee; ``if poor 
              Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, 
              degrading title of Mrs Heathcliff, she would soon have presented 
              a similar picture! She wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour 
              quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.'' </p>
            <p>`The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between 
              me and him: so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched 
              a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head. It struck 
              beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling 
              it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another; which I hope 
              went a little deeper than his missile. The last glimpse I caught 
              of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of 
              his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight 
              through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked 
              over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back 
              in the doorway; and, blest as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, 
              leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, 
              shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through 
              marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon light 
              of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual 
              dwelling in the infernal regions, than, even for one night, abide 
              beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.' </p>
            <p>Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, 
              and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, 
              and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another 
              hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's 
              portraits, bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the 
              carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering 
              her mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit the neighbourhood: 
              but a regular correspondence was established between her and my 
              master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was 
              in the south, near London; there she had a son born, a few months 
              subsequent to her escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the 
              first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish creature. </p>
            <p>Mr Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where 
              she lived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any 
              moment, only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should 
              not be with him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give 
              no information, he discovered, through some of the other servants, 
              both her place of residence and the existence of the child. Still 
              he didn't molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his 
              aversion, I suppose. He often asked about the infant, when he saw 
              me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: </p>
            <p>`They wish me to hate it too, do they?' </p>
            <p>`I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' I answered. 
            </p>
            <p>`But I'll have it,' he said, `when I want it. They may reckon on 
              that!' </p>
            <p>Fortunately, its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen 
              years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or 
              a little more. </p>
            <p>On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit, I had no opportunity 
              of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for 
              discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased 
              him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with 
              an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem 
              to allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained 
              from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. 
              Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: 
              he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, 
              avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire 
              seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied 
              by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his 
              wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers 
              were abroad. But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long. 
              He didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him. Time brought resignation, 
              and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. He recalled her memory 
              with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world; 
              where he doubted not she was gone. </p>
            <p>And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, 
              I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: 
              the coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing 
              could stammer a word or totter a step, it wielded a despot's sceptre 
              in his heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the 
              name in full, as he had never called the first Catherine short; 
              probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little 
              one was always Cathy; it formed to him a distinction from the mother, 
              and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its 
              relation to her, far more than from its being his own. </p>
            <p>I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and 
              perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so 
              opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, 
              and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how 
              they shouldn't both have taken the same road, for good or evil. 
              But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger 
              head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When 
              his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead 
              of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no 
              hope for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed 
              the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and 
              God comforted him. One hoped, and the other despaired: they chose 
              their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them. But 
              you'll not want to hear my moralizing, Mr Lockwood: you'll judge 
              as well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, 
              and that's the same. The end of Earnshaw was what might have been 
              expected; it followed fast on his sister's: there was scarcely six 
              months between them. We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct 
              account of his state preceding it; all that I did learn, was on 
              occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral. Mr 
              Kenneth came to announce the event to my master. </p>
            <p>`Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early 
              not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, `it's 
              yours and my turn to go into mourning at present. Who's given us 
              the slip now, do you think?' </p>
            <p>`Who?' I asked in a flurry. </p>
            <p>`Why, guess!' he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle 
              on a hook by the door. `And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm 
              certain you'll need it.' </p>
            <p>`Not Mr Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed. </p>
            <p>`What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor. `No, Heathcliff's 
              a tough young fellow: he looks blooming today. I've just seen him. 
              He's rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.' </p>
            <p>`Who is it then, Mr Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently. </p>
            <p>`Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, `and my 
              wicked gossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while. 
              There! I said we should draw water. But cheer up. He died true to 
              his character: drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I'm sorry, too. One can't 
              help missing an old companion: though he had the worst tricks with 
              him that ever man imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. 
              He's barely twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would 
              have thought you were born in one year?' </p>
            <p>I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs Linton's 
              death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down 
              in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Kenneth 
              to get another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not 
              hinder myself from pondering on the question--`Had he had fair play?' 
              Whatever I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely 
              pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering 
              Heights, and assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr Linton was 
              extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the 
              friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and 
              foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own. 
              Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife's nephew, 
              and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; 
              and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and 
              look over the concerns of his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending 
              to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at 
              length permitted me to go. His lawyer had been Earnshaw's also: 
              I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me. He shook 
              his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, 
              if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than 
              a beggar. </p>
            <p>`His father died in debt,' he said; `the whole property is mortgaged, 
              and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity 
              of creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be 
              inclined to deal leniently towards him.' </p>
            <p>When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see 
              everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient 
              distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr Heathcliff said 
              he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order 
              the arrangements for the funeral, if I chose. </p>
            <p>`Correctly,' he remarked, `that fool's body should be buried at 
              the crossroads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave 
              him ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened 
              the two doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night 
              in drinking himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, 
              for we heard him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over 
              the settle; flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent 
              for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed into 
              carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow 
              it was useless making more stir about him!' </p>
            <p>The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered: </p>
            <p>`Aw'd rayther he'd goan hisseln fur t' doctor! Aw sud uh taen tent 
              uh t' maister better nur him--un he warn't deead when Aw left, nowt 
              uh t' soart!' </p>
            <p>I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr Heathcliff said 
              I might have my own way there too; only, he desired me to remember 
              that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained 
              a hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow; 
              if anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult 
              work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like 
              exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing 
              the coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: 
              and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate 
              child on to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, `Now, my 
              bonny lad, you are mine! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as 
              crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!' The unsuspecting 
              thing was pleased at this speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, 
              and stroked his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 
              `That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There 
              is nothing in the world less yours than he is!' </p>
            <p>`Does Linton say so?' he demanded. </p>
            <p>`Of course--he has ordered me to take him,' I replied. </p>
            <p>`Well,' said the scoundrel, `we'll not argue the subject now: but 
              I have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate 
              to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, 
              if he attempt to remove it. I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; 
              but I'll be pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell 
              him.' </p>
            <p>This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance 
              on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, 
              spoke no more of interfering I'm not aware that he could have done 
              it to any purpose, had he been ever so willing. </p>
            <p>The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm 
              possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved 
              it to Mr Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land 
              he owned, for cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, 
              was the mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the 
              first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of 
              complete dependence on his father's inveterate enemy; and lives 
              in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages, 
              and quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, 
              and his ignorance that he has been wronged. </p>

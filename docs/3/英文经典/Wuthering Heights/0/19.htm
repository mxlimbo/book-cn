          <td>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return. 
            Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, 
            and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew. 
            Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; 
            and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellences 
            of her `real' cousin. The evening of their expected arrival came. 
            Since early morning, she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; 
            and now, attired in her new black frock--poor thing! her aunt's death 
            impressed her with no definite sorrow--she obliged me, by constant 
            worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them. 
            <p>`Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as 
              we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, 
              under shadow of the trees. `How delightful it will be to have him 
              for a playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his 
              hair; it was lighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine. 
              I have it carefully preserved in a little glass box: and I've often 
              thought what pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy--and 
              papa, dear, dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.' </p>
            <p>She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober 
              footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy 
              bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was 
              impossible: she couldn't be still a minute. </p>
            <p>`How long they are!' she exclaimed. `Ah, I see some dust on the 
              road they are coming? No! When will they be here? May we not go 
              a little way--half a mile, Ellen: only just half a mile? Do say 
              yes: to that clump of birches at the turn!' </p>
            <p>I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling 
              carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out 
              her arms, as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the 
              window. He descended, nearly as eager as herself: and a considerable 
              interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. 
              While they exchanged caresses, I took a peep in to see after Linton. 
              He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as 
              if it had been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might 
              have been taken for my master's younger brother, so strong was the 
              resemblance: but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect, that 
              Edgar Linton never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken 
              hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; 
              for the journey had fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one 
              glance, but her father told her to come on, and they walked together 
              up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the servants. </p>
            <p>`Now, darling,' said Mr Linton, addressing his daughter, as they 
              halted at the bottom of the front steps; `your cousin is not so 
              strong or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, 
              a very short time since; therefore, don't expect him to play and 
              run about with you directly. And don't harass him much by talking: 
              let him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?' </p>
            <p>Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: `but I do want to see him; 
              and he hasn't once looked out.' </p>
            <p>The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted 
              to the ground by his uncle. </p>
            <p>`This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little 
              hands together. `She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve 
              her by crying tonight. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is 
              at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself 
              as you please.' </p>
            <p>`Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's 
              salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears. 
            </p>
            <p>`Come, come, there's a good child,' I whispered, leading him in. 
            </p>
            <p>`You'll make her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!' </p>
            <p>I do not know whether it were sorrow for him, but his cousin put 
              on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. 
              All three entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid 
              ready. I proceeded to remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed 
              him on a chair by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he 
              began to cry afresh. My master inquired what was the matter. </p>
            <p>`I can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy. </p>
            <p>`Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea, answered 
              his uncle patiently. </p>
            <p>He had been greatly tried during the journey, I felt convinced, 
              by his fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, 
              and lay down. Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. 
              At first she sat silent; but that could not last: she had resolved 
              to make a pet of her little cousin, as she would have him to be; 
              and she commenced stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and 
              offering him tea in her saucer, like a baby. This pleased him, for 
              he was not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a 
              faint smile. </p>
            <p>`Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching 
              them a minute. `Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company 
              of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, 
              and by wishing for strength he'll gain it.' </p>
            <p>`Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings 
              came over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, 
              however will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights, between his 
              father and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be. Our 
              doubts were presently decided even earlier than I expected. I had 
              just taken the children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen 
              Linton asleep--he would not suffer me to leave him till that was 
              the case--I had come down, and was standing by the table in the 
              hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr Edgar, when a maid stepped 
              out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr Heathcliff's servant 
              Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with the master. </p>
            <p>`I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable 
              trepidation. `A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the 
              instant they have returned from a long journey. I don't think the 
              master can see him.' </p>
            <p>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, 
              and now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday 
              garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding 
              his hat in one hand and his stick in the other, he proceeded to 
              clean his shoes on the mat. </p>
            <p>`Good evening, Joseph,' I said coldly. `What business brings you 
              here tonight?' </p>
            <p>`It's Maister Linton Aw mun spake tull,' he answered, waving me 
              disdainfully aside. </p>
            <p>`Mr Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular 
              to say, I'm sure he won't hear it now,' I continued. `You had better 
              sit down in there, and entrust your message to me. </p>
            <p>`Which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of 
              closed doors. </p>
            <p>I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly 
              I went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, 
              advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr Linton had 
              no time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, 
              and, pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side 
              of the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, 
              and began in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition: </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff has send me for his lad, and Aw munn't goa back 'bout 
              him.' </p>
            <p>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow 
              overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own 
              account; but, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious 
              wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he 
              grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched 
              in his heart how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the 
              very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the 
              claimant more peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. 
              However, he was not going to rouse him from his sleep. </p>
            <p>`Tell Mr Heathcliff,' he answered calmly, `that his son shall come 
              to Wuthering Heights tomorrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go 
              the distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton 
              desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his 
              health is very precarious.' </p>
            <p>`Noa!' said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and 
              assuming an authoritative air; `noa! that manes nowt. Hathecliff 
              maks noa 'cahnt uh t' mother, nur yah norther; bud he'll hev his 
              lad; und Aw mun tak him--soa nah yah knaw!' </p>
            <p>`You shall not tonight!' answered Linton decisively. `Walk downstairs 
              at once, and, repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show 
              him down. Go--' </p>
            <p>And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid 
              the room of him, and closed the door. </p>
            <p>`Varrah weell!' shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. `Tuhmorn, 
              he's come hisseln, un thrust him aht, if yah darr!' </p>

          <td>On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow 
            his ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, 
            I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside 
            me, as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the 
            garden, where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and 
            when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded 
            him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, 
            and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from 
            the Grange. 
            <p>I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished 
              in a brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of 
              Joseph's eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower bed 
              in the midst of them. </p>
            <p>`There! That will be all shown to the master,' I exclaimed, `the 
              minute it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking 
              such liberties with the garden? `We shall have a fine explosion 
              on the head of it: see if we don't! Mr Hareton, I wonder you should 
              have no more wit, than to go and make that mess at her bidding!' 
            </p>
            <p>`I'd forgotten they were Joseph's,' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled; 
              `but I'll tell him I did it.' </p>
            <p>`We always ate our meals with Mr Heathcliff. I held the mistress's 
              post in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. 
              Catherine usually sat by me, but today she stole nearer to Hareton; 
              and I presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship 
              than she had in her hostility. </p>
            <p>`Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,' 
              were my whispered instructions as we entered the room. `It will 
              certainly annoy Mr Heathcliff, and he'll be mad at you both.' </p>
            <p>`I'm not going to,' she answered. </p>
            <p>The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses 
              in his plate of porridge. </p>
            <p>He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet 
              she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked 
              to laugh; and I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: 
              whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company, as his 
              countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing 
              him with deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her 
              nonsense; at last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr Heathcliff 
              started; his eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with 
              her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred. 
            </p>
            <p>`It is well you are out of my reach,' he exclaimed. &quot;What 
              fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those 
              infernal eyes? Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence 
              again. I thought I had cured you of laughing.' </p>
            <p>`It was me,' muttered Hareton. &quot;What do you say?' demanded 
              the master. </p>
            <p>Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. 
              Mr Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his 
              breakfast and his interrupted musing. `We had nearly finished, and 
              the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated 
              no further disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared 
              at the door, revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes, that 
              the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must 
              have seen Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined 
              it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, 
              and rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began: </p>
            <p>`Aw mun hev my wage, and Aw mun goa! Aw bed aimed tuh dee, wheare 
              Aw'd sarved fur sixty year; `un Aw thowt Aw'd lug my books up intuh 
              t' garret, un' all my bits uh stuff, un' they sud hev t' kitchen 
              tuh theirseln; fur t' sake uh quietness. It wur hard tuh gie up 
              my awn hearthstun, bud Aw thowt Aw could do that! Bud, nah, shoo's 
              taan my garden frough me, un' by th' heart, maister, Aw cannot stand

              an ow'd man dosen't sooin get used tuh new barthens. Aw'd rayther 
              arn my bite an' my sup wi' a hammer in th' road!' </p>
            <p>`Now, now, idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, `cut it short! `What's 
              your grievance? I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. 
              She may thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.' </p>
            <p>`It's noan Nelly!' answered Joseph. `Aw sudn't shift fur Nellie--nasty 
              ill nowt as shoo is. Thank God! shoo cannot stale t' sowl o' nob'dy! 
              Shoo wer niver soa handsome, bud whet a body mud look at her `baht 
              winking. It's yon flaysome, graceless quean, ut s witched ahr lad, 
              wi' her bold een un' her forrard ways--till--Nay! it fair brusts 
              my heart! He's forgetten all Ee done for him, un' made on him, un' 
              goan un' riven up a whole row ut t' grandest currant trees, i' t' 
              garden!' And here he lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his 
              bitter injuries, and Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition. 
            </p>
            <p>`Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr Heathcliff. `Hareton, is it you he's 
              finding fault with?' </p>
            <p>`I've pulled up two or three bushes,' replied the young man; `but 
              I'm going to set `em again.' </p>
            <p>`And why have you pulled them up?' said the master. Catherine unwisely 
              put in her tongue. </p>
            <p>&quot;We wanted to plant some flowers there,' she cried. `I'm the 
              only person to blame, for I wished him to do it.' </p>
            <p>`And who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place?' 
              demanded her father-in-law, much surprised. `And who ordered you 
              to obey her?' he added, turning to Hareton. </p>
            <p>The latter was speechless; his cousin replied: </p>
            <p>`You shouldn't grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, 
              when you have taken all my land!' </p>
            <p>`Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,' said Heathcliff. 
            </p>
            <p>`And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime 
              biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast. </p>
            <p>`Silence!' he exclaimed. `Get done, and begone!' </p>
            <p>`And Hareton's land, and his money,' pursued the reckless thing. 
              `Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!' 
            </p>
            <p>The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, 
              eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate. </p>
            <p>`If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,' she said; `so you 
              may as well sit down.' </p>
            <p>`If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him 
              to hell,' thundered Heathcliff. `Damnable witch! dare you pretend 
              to rouse him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into 
              the kitchen! I'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into 
              my sight again!' </p>
            <p>Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go. </p>
            <p>`Drag her away!' he cried savagely. `Are you staying to talk?' 
              And he approached to execute his own command. </p>
            <p>`He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more,' said Catherine; `and 
              he'll soon detest you as much as I do.' </p>
            <p>&quot;Wisht! wisht!' muttered the young man reproachfully. `I will 
              not hear you speak so to him. Have done.' </p>
            <p>`But you won't let him strike me?' she cried. `Come, then,' he 
              whispered earnestly. It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold 
              of her. </p>
            <p>`Now you go!' he said to Earnshaw. `Accursed witch! this time she 
              has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her repent 
              it for ever!' </p>
            <p>He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release the locks, 
              entreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff's black eyes 
              flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was 
              just worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his 
              fingers relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, 
              and gazed intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, 
              stood a moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to 
              Catherine, said with assumed calmness: `You must learn to avoid 
              putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some time! 
              Go with Mrs Dean, and keep with her; and confine your insolence 
              to her ears. As to Hareton Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, 
              I'll send him seeking his bread where he can get it! Your love will 
              make him an outcast and a beggar. Nelly, take her; and leave me 
              all of you! Leave me!' </p>
            <p>I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; 
              the other followed, and Mr Heathcliff had the room to himself till 
              dinner. I had counselled Catherine to get hers upstairs; but, as 
              soon as he perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He 
              spoke to none of us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, 
              intimating that he should not return before evening. </p>
            <p>The two new friends established themselves in the house during 
              his absence; when I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her 
              offering a revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father. 
              He said he wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered to him, in his disparagement: 
              if he were the devil, it didn't signify: he would stand by him; 
              and he'd rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin 
              on Mr Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found 
              means to make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like 
              him to speak ill of her father? and then she comprehended that Earnshaw 
              took the master's reputation home to himself; and was attached by 
              ties stronger than reason could break--chains, forged by habit, 
              which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good 
              heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions 
              of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow 
              that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: 
              indeed, I don't believe she has ever breathed a syllable, in the 
              latter's hearing, against her oppressor since. </p>
            <p>`When this slight disagreement was over, they were thick again, 
              and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and 
              teacher. I came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and 
              I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice 
              how time got on. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: 
              I had long been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would 
              be a source of equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent 
              nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation 
              in which it had been bred; and Catherine's sincere commendations 
              acted as a spur to his industry. His brightening mind brightened 
              his features, and added spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could 
              hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld on the day I discovered 
              my little lady at `Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the 
              Crags. `While I admired and they laboured, dusk grew on, and with 
              it returned the master. He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering 
              by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we 
              could raise our heads to glance at him. Well, I reflected, there 
              was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a 
              burning shame to scold them. The red firelight glowed on their two 
              bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest 
              of children; for,--though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, 
              each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced 
              nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity. </p>
            <p>They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr Heathcliff: perhaps 
              you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and 
              they are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has 
              no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain 
              arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether 
              she will or not. `With Hareton the resemblance is carried further: 
              it is singular at all times, then it was particularly striking; 
              because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened 
              to unwonted activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr Heathcliff: 
              he walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided 
              as he looked at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; 
              for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced 
              at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely 
              signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind 
              her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still. </p>
            <p>`It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded 
              a while on the scene he had just witnessed: `an absurd termination 
              to my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the 
              two houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, 
              and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to 
              lift a slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not 
              beaten me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their 
              representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where 
              is the use? I don't care for striking; I can't take the trouble 
              to raise my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole 
              time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from 
              being the case: I have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, 
              and I am too idle to destroy for nothing. </p>
            <p>`Nelly, there is a strange change approaching: I'm in its shadow 
              at present. I take so little interest in my daily life, that I hardly 
              remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are 
              the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to 
              me; and that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About 
              her I won't speak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly 
              wish she were invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. 
              He moves me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming 
              insane, I'd never see him again. You'll perhaps think me rather 
              inclined to become so,' he added, making an effort to smile, `if 
              I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas 
              he awakens or embodies. But you'll not talk of what I tell you; 
              and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, it is tempting at 
              last to turn it out to another. </p>
            <p>`Five minutes ago, Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, 
              not a human being: I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that 
              it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In 
              the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him 
              fearfully with her. That, however, which you may suppose the most 
              potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the least: for what 
              is not connected with her to me? and what does not recall her? I 
              cannot look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the 
              flags! In every cloud, in every tree--filling the air at night, 
              and caught by glimpses in every object by day--I am surrounded with 
              her image! The most ordinary faces of men and women--my own features--mock 
              me with a resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful collection 
              of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her! Well, 
              Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours 
              to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my 
              anguish: </p>
            <p>`But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will 
              let you know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society 
              is no benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer; 
              and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his 
              cousin go on together. I can give them no attention, any more. </p>
            <p>`But what do you mean by a change, Mr Heathcliff?' I said, alarmed 
              at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, 
              nor dying, according to my judgment; he was quite strong and healthy: 
              and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling 
              on dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had 
              a monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other 
              point his wits were as sound as mine. </p>
            <p>`I shall not know that till it comes,' he said, `I'm only half 
              conscious of it now. </p>
            <p>`You have no feelings of illness, have you?' I asked. </p>
            <p>`No, Nelly, I have not,' he answered. </p>
            <p>`Then you are not afraid of death?' I pursued. </p>
            <p>`Afraid? No!' he replied. `I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, 
              nor a hope of death. Why should I? `With my hard constitution and 
              temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, 
              and probably shall, remain above ground till there is scarcely a 
              black hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! 
              I have to remind myself to breathe--almost to remind my heart to 
              beat! And it is like bending back a stiff spring; it is by compulsion 
              that I do the slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by 
              compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated 
              with one universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being 
              and faculties are yearning to attain It. They have yearned towards 
              it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and 
              soon--because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in 
              the anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved 
              me; but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases 
              of humour which I show. O God! It is a long fight, I wish it were 
              over!' </p>
            <p>He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, 
              till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience 
              had turned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how 
              it would end. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of 
              mind, even by looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he 
              asserted it himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would 
              have conjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr Lockwood: 
              and at the period of which I speak he was just the same as then; 
              only fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic 
              in company. </p>

          <td> Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. 
            By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much 
            improved. The mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced 
            her plan of reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes 
            and flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, 
            hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze 
            us all breathless, there alighted from a handsome black pony a very 
            dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a 
            feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to 
            hold up with both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her 
            from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, `Why, Cathy, you are quite 
            a beauty! I should scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. 
            Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?' 
            <p>`Isabella has not her natural advantages,' replied his wife: `but 
              she must mind and not grow wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine 
              off with her things--stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls--let 
              me untie your hat.' </p>
            <p>I removed the habit, and there shone forth, beneath a grand plaid 
              silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her 
              eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome 
              her, she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid 
              garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas 
              cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and, then, she 
              looked round for Heathcliff. Mr and Mrs Earnshaw watched anxiously 
              their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, 
              what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two 
              friends. </p>
            <p>Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, 
              and uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times 
              more so, since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him 
              a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children 
              of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, 
              not to mention his clothes, which had seen three months' service 
              in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his 
              face and hands was dismally beclouded. He might well skulk behind 
              the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the 
              house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected. 
              `Is Heathcliff not here?' she demanded, pulling off her gloves, 
              and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and 
              staying indoors. </p>
            <p>`Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr Hindley, enjoying 
              his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard 
              he would be compelled to present himself. `You may come and wish 
              Miss Catherine welcome, like the other servants.' </p>
            <p>Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew 
              to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek 
              within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into 
              a laugh, exclaiming, `Why, how very black and cross you look! and 
              how--how funny and grim! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and 
              Isabella Linton. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?' </p>
            <p>She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw 
              double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable. </p>
            <p>`Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr Earnshaw, condescendingly; `once 
              in a way, that is permitted.' </p>
            <p>`I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; `I 
              shall not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!' </p>
            <p>And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized 
              him again. </p>
            <p>`I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; `I could not hinder 
              myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? 
              It was only that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush 
              your hair, it will be all right: but you are so dirty!' </p>
            <p>She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, 
              and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment 
              from its contact with his. </p>
            <p>`You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and 
              snatching away his hand. `I shall be as dirty as I please: and I 
              like to be dirty, and I will be dirty.' </p>
            <p>With that he dashed head foremost out of the room, amid the merriment 
              of the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; 
              who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such 
              an exhibition of bad temper. </p>
            <p>After playing lady's-maid to the newcomer, and putting my cakes 
              in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great 
              fires, befitting Christmas eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse 
              myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations 
              that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. 
              He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr and Mrs 
              Earnshaw were engaging Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought 
              for her to present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of 
              their kindness. They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering 
              Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one condition: 
              Mrs Linton begged that her darlings must be kept carefully apart 
              from that `naughty swearing boy'. </p>
            <p>Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich 
              scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, 
              the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a 
              tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, 
              the speckless purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept 
              floor. I gave due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered 
              how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me 
              a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas box; 
              and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, 
              and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed 
              him; and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad's situation 
              now, and from singing I changed my mind to crying. It struck me 
              soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair 
              some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them: I got up and walked 
              into the court to seek him. He was not far; I found him smoothing 
              the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other 
              beasts, according to custom. </p>
            <p>`Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, `the kitchen is so comfortable; 
              and Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before 
              Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole 
              hearth to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.' </p>
            <p>He proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me. 
            </p>
            <p>`Come--are you coming?' I continued. `There's a little cake for 
              each of you, nearly enough; and you'll need half an hour's donning.' 
            </p>
            <p>I waited five minutes, but getting no answer, left him. Catherine 
              supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined in 
              an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness 
              on the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night 
              for the fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o'clock, 
              and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, 
              having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends: 
              she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was 
              gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and 
              then went back. In the morning he rose early; and as it was a holiday 
              carried his ill humour on to the moors; not reappearing till the 
              family were departed for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to 
              have brought him to a better spirit. He hung about me for a while, 
              and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly: </p>
            <p>`Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.' </p>
            <p>`High time, Heathcliff,' I said; `you have grieved Catherine: she's 
              sorry she ever came home, I dare say! It looks as if you envied 
              her, because she is more thought of than you.' </p>
            <p>The notion of envying Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but 
              the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough. </p>
            <p>`Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious. 
              `She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.' </p>
            <p>`Well, I cried last night,' he returned, `and I had more reason 
              to cry than she.' </p>
            <p>`Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and 
              an empty stomach,' said I. `Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. 
              But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, 
              mind, when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and 
              say--you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as 
              if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. 
              And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I'll steal time to arrange 
              you so that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and 
              that he does. You are younger, and yet, I'll be bound, you are taller 
              and twice as broad across the shoulders: you could knock him down 
              in a twinkling? don't you feel that you could?' </p>
            <p>Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, 
              and he sighed. </p>
            <p>`But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't 
              make him less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and 
              a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance 
              of being as rich as he will be!' </p>
            <p>`And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, `and trembled if 
              a country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day 
              for a shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! 
              Come to the glass, and I'll let you see what you should wish. Do 
              you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, 
              that instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple 
              of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows 
              boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil's spies? Wish and 
              learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, 
              and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting 
              and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not 
              sure of foes. Don't get the expression of a vicious cur that appears 
              to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the 
              world as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.' </p>
            <p>`In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes 
              and even forehead,' he replied. `I do--and that won't help me to 
              them.' </p>
            <p>`A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 
              `if you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest 
              into something worse than ugly. And now that we've done washing, 
              and combing, and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself 
              rather handsome? I'll tell you, I do. You're fit for a prince in 
              disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your 
              mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week's 
              income, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you 
              were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I 
              in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts 
              of what I was should give me courage and dignity to support the 
              oppressions of a little farmer!' </p>
            <p>So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and 
              began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation 
              was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering 
              the court. He ran to the window and I to the door, just in time 
              to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered 
              in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses: 
              they often rode to church in winter. Catherine took a hand of each 
              of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before 
              the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces. </p>
            <p>I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, 
              and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he 
              opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened 
              it on the other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him 
              clean and cheerful; or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs 
              Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 
              `keep the fellow out of the room--send him into the garret till 
              dinner is over. He'll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing 
              the fruit, if left alone with them a minute.' </p>
            <p>`Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, `he'll touch nothing, 
              not he: and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as 
              well as we.' </p>
            <p>`He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs 
              again till dark,' cried Hindley. `Begone, you vagabond! What! you 
              are attempting the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those 
              elegant locks--see if I won't pull them a bit longer.' </p>
            <p>`They are long enough, already,' observed Master Linton, peeping 
              from the doorway; `I wonder they don't make his head ache. It's 
              like a colt's mane over his eyes!' </p>
            <p>He ventured his remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's 
              violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence 
              from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival. He seized 
              a tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his 
              gripe) and dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who 
              instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine 
              hurrying to the place. Mr Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly 
              and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered 
              a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he reappeared red 
              and breathless. I got the dish-cloth and rather spitefully scrubbed 
              Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. 
              His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, 
              blushing for all. </p>
            <p>`You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master 
              Linton. `He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; 
              and he'll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can't eat my dinner. 
              Why did you speak to him, Edgar?' </p>
            <p>`I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing 
              the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief. 
              `I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.' 
            </p>
            <p>`Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously, `you're not 
              killed. Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! 
              Give over, Isabella! Has anybody hurt you?' </p>
            <p>`There, there, children--to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling 
              in. `That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master 
              Edgar, take the law into your own fists--it will give you an appetite!' 
            </p>
            <p>The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant 
              feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since 
              no real harm had befallen them. Mr Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, 
              and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind 
              her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and 
              an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before 
              her. `An unfeeling child,' I thought to myself; `how lightly she 
              dismisses her old playmate's troubles. I could not have imagined 
              her to be so selfish.' She lifted a mouthful to her lips; then she 
              set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over 
              them. She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under 
              the cloth to conceal her emotion. I did not cal her unfeeling long; 
              for I perceived she was in purgatory through out the day, and wearying 
              to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit 
              to Heathcliff, who had been locked up b the master: as I discovered, 
              on endeavouring to introduce to him private mess of victuals. </p>
            <p>In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might b liberated 
              then, as Isabella Linton had no partner; her entreaties were vain, 
              and I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all 
              gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased 
              by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: 
              a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoon French horns, and a bass 
              viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable 
              houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed 
              it a first-rate treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been 
              sung, we set them to songs and glees. Mrs Earnshaw loved the music, 
              and so they gave us plenty. </p>
            <p>Catherine loved it too; but she said it sounded sweetest at the 
              top of the steps, and she went up in the dark; I followed. They 
              shut the house door below, never noting our absence, it was so full 
              people. She made no stay at the stair's head, but mounted farther, 
              to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. I stubbornly 
              declined answering for a while; she persevered, and finally persuaded 
              him to hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor 
              things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going 
              to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment; then, I clambered 
              up the ladder to warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard 
              her voice within. The little monkey had crept by the skylight of 
              one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and 
              it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again. When 
              she did come Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should 
              take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's 
              to be removed from the sound of our `devil's psalmody', as it pleased 
              him to call it. I told them I intended by no means to encourage 
              their tricks; but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since 
              yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr Hindley that 
              once. He went down; I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him 
              a quantity of good things; but he was sick and could eat little, 
              and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He leant his 
              two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and remained 
              wrapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, 
              he answered gravely: </p>
            <p>`I'm trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don't care 
              how long I wait, if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not 
              die before I do!' </p>
            <p>`For shame, Heathcliff!' said I. `It is for God to punish wicked 
              people; we should learn to forgive.' </p>
            <p>`No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned. 
              `I only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I'll plan it 
              out: while I'm thinking of that I don't feel pain.' </p>
            <p>But, Mr Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I'm annoyed 
              how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel 
              cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliffs history, 
              all that you need hear, in half a dozen words. </p>
            <p>Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, arid proceeded 
              to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the 
              hearth, and I was very far from nodding. `Sit still, Mrs Dean,' 
              I cried, `do sit still, another half-hour! You've done just right 
              to tell the story leisurely. That is the method I like; and you 
              must finish it in the same style. I am interested in every character 
              you have mentioned, more or less.' </p>
            <p>`The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.' </p>
            <p>`No matter--I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. 
              One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.' </p>
            <p>`You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the very prime of the morning 
              gone long before that time. A person who has not done one half his 
              day's work by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half 
              undone.' </p>
            <p>`Nevertheless, Mrs Dean, resume your chair; because to morrow I 
              intend lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for 
              myself an obstinate cold, at least.' </p>
            <p>`I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three 
              years; during that space Mrs Earnshaw---' </p>
            <p>`No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with 
              the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat 
              licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation 
              so intently that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously 
              out of temper?' </p>
            <p>`A terribly lazy mood, I should say.' </p>
            <p>`On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; 
              and, therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these 
              regions acquire over people in towns the value that the spider in 
              a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; 
              and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation 
              of the looker-on. They do live more in earnest, more in themselves, 
              and less in surface change, and frivolous external things. I could 
              fancy a love for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever 
              in any love of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a 
              hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his 
              entire appetite and do it justice; the other, introducing him to 
              a table laid out by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much 
              enjoyment from the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard 
              and remembrance.' </p>
            <p>`Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know 
              us,' observed Mrs Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech. </p>
            <p>`Excuse me,' I responded; `you, my good friend, are a striking 
              evidence against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms 
              of slight consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I 
              am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you 
              have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think. 
              You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for 
              want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.' 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs Dean laughed. </p>
            <p>`I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' 
              she said; `not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one 
              set of faces, and one series of actions, from year's end to year's 
              end; but I have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me 
              wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr Lockwood. 
              You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked 
              into, and got something out of also: unless it be that range of 
              Greek and Latin and that of French; and those I know one from another: 
              it is as much as you can expect of a poor man's daughter. However, 
              if I am to follow my story in true gossip's fashion, I had better 
              go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will be content to 
              pass to the next summer--the summer of 1778, that is, nearly twenty-three 
              years ago.' </p>

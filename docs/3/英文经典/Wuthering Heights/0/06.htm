          <td> Mr Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, 
            and set the neighbours gossiping right and left--he brought a wife 
            with him. What she was, and where she was born, he never informed 
            us: probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he 
            would scarcely have kept the union from his father. 
            <p>She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her 
              own account. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold, 
              appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place 
              about her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence 
              of the mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour 
              while that went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with 
              her, though I should have been dressing the children; and there 
              she sat shivering and clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly: 
              `Are they gone yet?' Then she began describing with hysterical emotion 
              the effect it produced on her to see black; and started, and trembled, 
              and, at last, fell a-weeping-and when I asked what was the matter? 
              answered, she didn't know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined 
              her as little likely to die as myself. She was rather thin, but 
              young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as 
              diamonds. I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made 
              her breathe very quick: that the least sudden noise set her all 
              in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I 
              knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse 
              to sympathize with her. We don't in general take to foreigners here, 
              Mr Lockwood, unless they take to us first. </p>
            <p>Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his 
              absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and 
              dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he 
              told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the 
              back kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have 
              carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife 
              expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, 
              at the pewter dishes and delf case, and dog kennel, and the wide 
              space there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he 
              thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention. 
            </p>
            <p>She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new 
              acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and 
              ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the 
              beginning. Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she 
              grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing 
              a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old 
              hatred of the boy. He drove him from their company to the servants, 
              deprived him of the instructions of the curate, and insisted that 
              he should labour out of doors instead; compelling him to do so as 
              hard as any other lad on the farm. </p>
            <p>Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy 
              taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the 
              fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the 
              young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what 
              they did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen 
              after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate 
              reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves; and 
              that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine 
              a fast from dinner or supper. But it was one of their chief amusements 
              to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day, 
              and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate 
              might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by 
              heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they 
              forgot everything the minute they were together again: at least 
              the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and 
              many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless 
              daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing 
              the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures. 
              One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the 
              sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; 
              and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere. 
              We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; 
              they were invisible: and at last, Hindley in a passion told us to 
              bolt the doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. 
              The household went to bed; and I' too anxious to lie down, opened 
              my lattice and put my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined 
              to admit them in spite of the prohibition, should they return. In 
              a while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light 
              of a lantern glimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my 
              head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr Earnshaw by knocking. 
              There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him 
              alone. </p>
            <p>`Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly. `No accident, I hope?' 
            </p>
            <p>`At Thrushcross Grange,' he answered; `and I would have been there 
              too, but they had not the manners to ask me to stay. `Well, you 
              will catch it!' I said: `you'll never be content till you're sent 
              about your business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross 
              Grange?' </p>
            <p>`Let me get off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, 
              Nelly,' he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and 
              while he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued--`Cathy 
              and I escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and 
              getting a glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just 
              go and see whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing 
              shivering in corners, while their father and mother sat eating and 
              drinking, and singing and laughing; and burning their eyes out before 
              the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechized 
              by their manservant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, 
              if they don't answer properly?' </p>
            <p>`Probably not,' I responded. `They are good children, no doubt, 
              and don't deserve the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.' 
            </p>
            <p>`Don't you cant, Nelly,' he said: `nonsense! We ran from the top 
              of the Heights to the park, without stopping--Catherine completely 
              beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You'll have to seek 
              for her shoes in the bog tomorrow. We crept through a broken hedge, 
              groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a flower plot 
              under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence; they 
              had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half closed. 
              Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement, and 
              clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a splendid 
              place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, 
              and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass drops 
              hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little 
              soft tapers. Old Mr and Mrs Linton were not there; Edgar and his 
              sister had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been happy? 
              We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what 
              your good children were doing? Isabella--I believe she is eleven, 
              a year younger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the 
              room, shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into 
              her. Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle 
              of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, 
              from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled 
              in two between them. The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel 
              who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry because 
              both, after struggling to get it, refused to take it. We laughed 
              outright at the petted things; we did despise them! When would you 
              catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted? or find us by ourselves, 
              seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the 
              ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not exchange, for a thousand 
              lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange--not 
              if I might have the privilege of flinging--Joseph off the highest 
              gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's blood!' </p>
            <p>`Hush, hush!' I interrupted. `Still you have not told me, Heathcliff, 
              how Catherine is left behind?' </p>
            <p>`I told you we laughed,' he answered. `The Lintons heard us, and 
              with one accord, they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, 
              and then a cry, &quot;Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come 
              here. Oh, papa, oh!&quot; They really did howl out something in 
              that way. We made frightful noises to terrify them still more, and 
              then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was drawing the 
              bars, and we felt we had better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and 
              was urging her on, when all at once she fell down. &quot;Run, Heathcliff, 
              run!&quot; she whispered. &quot;They have let the bulldog loose, 
              and he holds me!&quot; The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I 
              heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out--no! she would 
              have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a 
              mad cow. I did, though! I vociferated curses enough to annihilate 
              any fiend in Christendom; and I got a store and thrust it between 
              his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. 
              A beast of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting--&quot;Keep 
              fast, Skulker, keep fast!&quot; He changed his note, however--when 
              he saw Skulker's game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple 
              tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips 
              streaming with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up: she was sick: 
              not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I 
              followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. &quot;What prey, 
              Robert?&quot; hallooed Linton from the entrance. &quot;Skulker has 
              caught a little girl, sir,&quot; he replied; &quot;and there's a 
              lad here&quot;, he added, making a clutch at me, &quot;who looks 
              an out-and-outer! Very like, the robbers were for putting them through 
              the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, 
              that they might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed 
              thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr Linton, sir, 
              don't lay by your gun.&quot; &quot;No, no, Robert,&quot; said the 
              old fool. &quot;The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day: 
              they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a reception. 
              There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To 
              beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where 
              will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be 
              afraid, it is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his 
              face; would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, 
              before he shows his nature in acts as well as features?&quot; He 
              pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs Linton placed her spectacles 
              on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The cowardly children 
              crept nearer also, Isabella lisping--&quot;Frightful thing! Put 
              him in the cellar, papa. He's exactly like the son of the fortune-teller 
              that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't he, Edgar?&quot; </p>
            <p>`While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, 
              and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected 
              sufficient wit to recognize her. They see us at church, you know, 
              though we seldom meet them elsewhere. &quot;That's Miss Earnshaw!&quot; 
              he whispered to his mother, &quot;and look how Skulker has bitten 
              her--how her foot bleeds!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!&quot; cried the dame; &quot;Miss 
              Earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the 
              child is in mourning--surely it is--and she may be lamed for life!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What culpable carelessness in her brother!&quot; exclaimed 
              Mr Linton, turning from me to Catherine. &quot;I've understood from 
              Shielders&quot; (that was the curate, sir) &quot;that he lets her 
              grow up in absolute heathenism. But who is this? Where did she pick 
              up this companion? Oho! I declare he is that strange acquisition 
              my late neighbour made, in his journey to Liverpool--a little Lascar, 
              or an American or Spanish castaway.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A wicked boy, at all events,&quot; remarked the old lady, 
              &quot;and quite unfit for a decent house! Did you notice his language, 
              Linton? I'm shocked that my children should have heard it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>`I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert was 
              ordered to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged 
              me into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me 
              that Mr Earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding 
              me march directly, secured the door again. The curtains were still 
              looped up at one comer, and I resumed my station as spy; because, 
              if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great 
              glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let her out. 
              She sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs Linton took off the grey cloak 
              of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking 
              her head and expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young 
              lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine. 
              Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed 
              her feet; and Mr Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied 
              a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a distance. 
              Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and gave her 
              a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I 
              left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the 
              little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling 
              a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim 
              reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were full of 
              stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody 
              on earth, is she not, Nelly?' </p>
            <p>`There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered, 
              covering him up and extinguishing the light. `You are incurable, 
              Heathcliff; and Mr Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, 
              see if he won't.' My words came truer than I desired. The luckless 
              adventure made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr Linton, to mend matters, 
              paid us a visit himself on the morrow; and read the young master 
              such a lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred 
              to look about him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, 
              but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should 
              ensure a dismissal; and Mrs Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law 
              in due restraint when she returned home; employing art, not force: 
              with force she would have found it impossible. </p>

          <td>I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since 
            she left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after 
            her, and wouldn't let me pass. He said Mrs Linton was `thrang', and 
            the master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they 
            go on, otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. 
            She thinks Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by 
            her talk. My young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; 
            but Mr Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his 
            daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, 
            being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child's 
            annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted 
            my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her 
            some great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, 
            a little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; 
            and this is what she told me. 
            <p>`The first thing Mrs Linton did', she said, `on her arrival at 
              the Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good evening 
              to me and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained 
              till morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, 
              she entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might 
              be sent for? her cousin was very ill. </p>
            <p>`&quot;We know that!&quot; answered Heathcliff; &quot;but his life 
              is not worth a farthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>`&quot;But I cannot tell how to do,&quot; she said; &quot;and if 
              nobody will help me, he'll die!&quot; </p>
            <p>`&quot;Walk out of the room,&quot; cried the master, &quot;and 
              let me never hear a word more about him! None here care what becomes 
              of him; if you do, act the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and 
              leave him.&quot; </p>
            <p>`Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague 
              with the tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to 
              wait on Linton, Mr Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her. </p>
            <p>`How they managed together, I can't tell. I fancy he fretted a 
              great deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious 
              little rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She 
              sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as 
              if she would fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey 
              the master: I never dare disobey him, Mrs Dean; and, though I thought 
              it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern 
              of mine either to advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. 
              Once or twice, after we had gone to bed, I've happened to open my 
              door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs' top; and then 
              I've shut myself in quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. 
              I did pity her then, I'm sure: still I didn't wish to lose my place, 
              you know. </p>
            <p>`At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened 
              me out of my wits, by saying: </p>
            <p>`&quot;Tell Mr Heathcliff that his son is dying--I'm sure he is, 
              this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.&quot; </p>
            <p>`Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter 
              of an hour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred--the house was 
              quiet. </p>
            <p>`She's mistaken, I said to myself. He's got over it. I needn't 
              disturb them; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second 
              time by a sharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put 
              up on purpose for Linton; and the master called to me to see what 
              was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn't have that noise 
              repeated. </p>
            <p>`I delivered Catherine's message. He cursed to himself, and in 
              a few minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their 
              room. I followed. Mrs Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with 
              her hands folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the 
              light to Linton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards 
              he turned to her. </p>
            <p>`&quot;Now--Catherine,&quot; he said, &quot;how do you feel?&quot; 
              `She was dumb. `&quot;How do you feel, Catherine?&quot; he repeated. 
            </p>
            <p>`&quot;He's safe, and I'm free,&quot; she answered: &quot;I should 
              feel well--but&quot;, she continued, with a bitterness she couldn't 
              conceal, &quot;you have left me so long to struggle against death 
              alone, that I feel and see only death! I feel like death!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>`And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton 
              and Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of 
              feet, and heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, 
              I believe, of the lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: 
              though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking 
              of Linton. But the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn't 
              want his help. He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his 
              chamber, and told me to return to mine, and Mrs Heathcliff remained 
              by herself. </p>
            <p>`In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast: 
              she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was 
              ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr Heathcliff, and he 
              replied: </p>
            <p>`&quot;Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and 
              then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, 
              tell me.&quot;' </p>
            <p>Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited 
              her twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her 
              attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled. 
            </p>
            <p>Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton's will. He had bequeathed 
              the whole of his, and what had been her, movable property to his 
              father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act 
              during her week's absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being 
              a minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr Heathcliff has claimed 
              and kept them in his wife's right and his also: I suppose legally: 
              at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb 
              his possession. </p>
            <p>`Nobody', said Zillah, `ever approached her door, except that once, 
              but I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of 
              her coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had 
              cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear 
              any longer being in the cold: and I told her the master was going 
              to Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her from 
              descending; so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, 
              she made her appearance donned in black, and her yellow curls combed 
              back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker: she couldn't comb them 
              out. </p>
            <p>`Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays'; the kirk, you 
              know, has no minister now, explained Mrs Dean; and they call the 
              Methodists' or Baptists' place (I can't say which it is), at Gimmerton, 
              a chapel. `Joseph had gone,' she continued, `but I thought proper 
              to bide at home. Young folks are always the better for an elder's 
              overlooking; and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn't a model 
              of nice behaviour. I let him know that his cousin would very likely 
              sit with us, and she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; 
              so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, 
              while she stayed. He coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes 
              over his hands and clothes. The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved 
              out of sight in a minute. I saw he meant to give her his company; 
              and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be presentable; so, laughing, 
              as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I offered to help him, 
              if he would, and joked at his confusion. He grew sullen, and began 
              to swear. </p>
            <p>`Now, Mrs Dean,' Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner, 
              `you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr Hareton; and happen 
              you're right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a 
              peg lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do 
              for her, now? She's as poor as you or I: poorer I'll be bound: you're 
              saving, and I'm doing my little all that road.'?Hareton allowed 
              Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a good humour: 
              so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults, he 
              tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account. </p>
            <p>`Missis walked in', she said, `as chill as an icicle, and as high 
              as a princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the armchair. 
              No, she turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and 
              bid her come to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure 
              she was starved. </p>
            <p>`&quot;I've been starved a month and more,&quot; she answered, 
              resting on the word as scornful as she could. </p>
            <p>`And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from 
              both of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, 
              and discovered a number of books in the dresser; she was instantly 
              upon her feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too 
              high up. Her cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last 
              summoned courage to help her; she held her frock, and he filled 
              it with the first that came to hand. </p>
            <p>`That was a great advance for the lad. She didn't thank him; still, 
              he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured 
              to stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point 
              out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; 
              nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page 
              from his finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back, 
              and looking at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or 
              seeking for something to read. His attention became, by degrees, 
              quite centred in the study of her thick, silky curls: her face he 
              couldn't see, and she couldn't see him. And, perhaps, not quite 
              awake to what he did, but attracted like a child to a candle, at 
              last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put out his hand 
              and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird. He might have 
              stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a taking. 
            </p>
            <p>`&quot;Get away, this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you 
              stopping there?&quot; she cried, in a tone of disgust. &quot;I can't 
              endure you! I'll go upstairs again, if you come near me.&quot; </p>
            <p>`Mr Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat 
              down in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her 
              volumes another half-hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered 
              to me: </p>
            <p>`&quot;Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I'm stalled of doing 
              naught; and I do like--I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted 
              it, but ask of yourseln.&quot; </p>
            <p>`&quot;Mr Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,&quot; I said 
              immediately. &quot;He'd take it very kind--he'd be much obliged.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>`She frowned; and looking up, answered: </p>
            <p>`&quot;Mr Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough 
              to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the 
              hypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say 
              to any of you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, 
              even to see one of your faces, you all kept off. But I won't complain 
              to you! I'm driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you 
              or enjoy your society.&quot; </p>
            <p>`&quot;What could I ha' done?&quot; began Earnshaw. &quot;How was 
              I to blame?&quot; </p>
            <p>`&quot;Oh! you are an exception,&quot; answered Mrs Heathcliff. 
              &quot;I never missed such a concern as you.&quot; </p>
            <p>`&quot;But I offered more than once, and asked,&quot; he said, 
              kindling up at her pertness, &quot;I asked Mr Heathcliff to let 
              me wake for you 宍&quot;Be silent! I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, 
              rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!&quot; said my 
              lady. </p>
            <p>`Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging 
              his gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. 
              He talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat 
              to her solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her 
              pride, she was forced to condescend to our company, more and more. 
              However, I took care there should be no further scorning at my good 
              nature: ever since, I've been as stiff as herself; and she has no 
              lover or liker among us: and she does not deserve one; for, let 
              them say the least word to her, and she'll curl back without respect 
              of anyone! She'll snap at the master himself, and as good as dares 
              him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more venomous 
              she grows.' </p>
            <p>At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to 
              leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and 
              live with me: but Mr Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he 
              would set up Hareton in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, 
              at present, unless she could marry again: and that scheme it does 
              not come within my province to arrange. </p>
            <p>Thus ended Mrs Dean's story. Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, 
              I am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second 
              week in January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or 
              two, and riding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord 
              that I shall spend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, 
              he may look out for another tenant to take the place after October. 
              I would not pass another winter here for much. </p>

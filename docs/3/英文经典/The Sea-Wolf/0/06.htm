              <p>　　BY THE FOLLOWING MORNING the storm had blown itself quite out, 
                and the Ghost was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath 
                of wind. Occasional light airs were felt, however, and Wolf Larsen 
                patrolled the poop constantly, his eyes ever searching the sea 
                to the northeast, from which direction the great trade-wind must 
                blow. </p>
              <p>　　The men are all on deck and busy preparing their various boats 
                for the season's hunting. There are seven boats aboard, the captain's 
                dinghy and the six which the hunters will use. Three, a hunter, 
                a boat-puller, and a boat-steerer, compose a boat's crew. On board 
                the schooner the boat-pullers and steerers are the crew. The hunters, 
                too, are supposed to be in command of the watches, subject always 
                to the orders of Wolf Larsen. </p>
              <p>　　All this, and more, I have learned. The Ghost is considered 
                the fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets. 
                In fact, she was once a private yacht, and was built for speed. 
                Her lines and fittings, though I know nothing about such things, 
                speak for themselves. Johnson was telling me about her in a short 
                chat I had with him during yesterday's second dog-watch. He spoke 
                most enthusiastically, with the love for a fine craft such as 
                some men feel for horses. He is greatly disgusted with the outlook, 
                and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen bears a very unsavory 
                reputation among the sealing-captains. It was the Ghost herself 
                that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage, but he is already 
                beginning to repent. </p>
              <p>　　As he told me, the Ghost is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably 
                fine model. Her beam, or width, is twenty-three feet, and her 
                length a little over ninety feet. A lead keel of fabulous but 
                unknown weight makes her very stable, while she carries an immense 
                spread of canvas. From the deck to the truck of the maintopmast 
                is something over a hundred feet, while the foremast with its 
                topmast is eight or ten feet shorter. I am giving these details 
                so that the size of this little floating world which holds twenty-two 
                men may be appreciated. It is a very little world, a mote, a speck, 
                and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a contrivance 
                so small and fragile. </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen has also a reputation for reckless carrying on 
                of sail. I overheard Henderson and another of the hunters, Standish, 
                a Californian, talking about it. Two years ago he dismasted the 
                Ghost in a gale in Bering Sea, whereupon the present masts were 
                put in, which are stronger and heavier in every way. He is said 
                to have remarked, when he put them in, that he preferred turning 
                her over to losing the sticks. </p>
              <p>　　Every man aboard, with the exception of Johansen, who is rather 
                overcome by his promotion, seems to have an excuse for having 
                sailed on the Ghost. Half the men forward are deep-water sailors, 
                and their excuse is that they did not know anything about her 
                or her captain. And those who do know whisper that the hunters, 
                while excellent shots, were so notorious for their quarrelsome 
                and rascally proclivities that they could not sign on any decent 
                schooner. </p>
              <p>　　I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew. Louis 
                he is called, a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman, 
                and a very sociable fellow, prone to talk as long as he can find 
                a listener. In the afternoon, while the cook was below asleep 
                and I was peeling the everlasting potatoes, Louis dropped into 
                the galley for a 'yarn.' His excuse for being aboard was that 
                he was drunk when he signed. He assured me again and again that 
                it was the last thing in the world he would dream of doing in 
                a sober moment. It seems that he has been seal-hunting regularly 
                each season for a dozen years, and is accounted one of the two 
                or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets. </p>
              <p>　　'Ah, my boy,'- he shook his head ominously at me,- ''t is the 
                worst schooner ye could iv selected; nor were ye drunk at the 
                time, as was I. 'T is sealin' is the sailor's paradise- on other 
                ships than this. The mate was the first, but, mark me words, there'll 
                be more dead men before the trip is done with. Hist, now, between 
                you an' meself an' the stanchion there, this Wolf Larsen is a 
                regular devil, an' the Ghost'll be a hell-ship like she's always 
                be'n since he had hold iv her. Don't I know? Don't I know? Don't 
                I remember him in Hakodate two years gone, when he had a row an' 
                shot four iv his men? Wasn't I a-layin' on the Emma L., not three 
                hundred yards away? An' there was a man the same year he killed 
                with a blow iv his fist. Yes, sir, killed 'im dead- oh. His head 
                must iv smashed like an egg-shell. 'T is the beast he is, this 
                Wolf Larsen- the great big beast mentioned iv in Revelations; 
                an' no good end will he ever come to. But I've said nothin' to 
                ye, mind ye; I've whispered never a word; for old fat Louis'll 
                live the voyage out, if the last mother's son of yez go to the 
                fishes. </p>
              <p>　　'Wolf Larsen!' he snorted a moment later. 'Listen to the word, 
                will ye! Wolf- 't is what he is. He's not black-hearted, like 
                some men. 'T is no heart he has at all. Wolf, just wolf, 't is 
                what he is. D'ye wonder he's well named?' </p>
              <p>　　'But if he is so well known for what he is,' I queried, 'how 
                is it that he can get men to ship with him?' </p>
              <p>　　'An' how is it ye can get men to do anything on God's earth 
                an' sea?' Louis demanded with Celtic fire. 'How d' ye find me 
                aboard if 't wasn't that I was drunk as a pig when I put me name 
                down? There's them that can't sail with better men, like the hunters, 
                an' them that don't know, like the poor devils of wind-jammers 
                for'ard there. But they'll come to it, they'll come to it, an' 
                be sorry the day they was born. I could weep for the poor creatures, 
                did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the troubles before him. 
                But 't is not a whisper I've dropped; mind ye, not a whisper. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Them hunters is the wicked boys,' he broke forth again, for 
                he suffered from a constitutional plethora of speech. 'But wait 
                till they get to cuttin' up iv jinks an' rowin' round. He's the 
                boy'll fix 'em. 'T is him that'll put the fear of God in their 
                rotten black hearts. Look at that hunter iv mine, Horner. &quot;Jock&quot; 
                Horner they call him, so quiet-like an' easy-goin'; soft-spoken 
                as a girl, till ye'd think butter wouldn't melt in the mouth iv 
                him. Didn't he kill his boat-steerer last year? 'T was called 
                a sad accident, but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama, an' the 
                straight iv it was given me. An' there's Smoke, the black little 
                devil- didn't the Roosians have him for three years in the salt-mines 
                of Siberia for poachin' on Copper Island, which is a Roosian preserve? 
                Shackled he was, hand an' foot, with his mate. An' didn't they 
                have words or a ruction of some kind? For 't was the other fellow 
                Smoke sent up in the buckets to the top of the mine; an' a piece 
                at a time he went up, a leg today, an' tomorrow an arm, the next 
                day the head, an' so on.' </p>
              <p>　　'But you can't mean it!' I cried out, overcome with the horror 
                of it. </p>
              <p>　　'Mean what?' he demanded, quick as a flash. ''T is nothin' 
                I've said. Deef I am, an' dumb, as ye should be for the sake iv 
                your mother; an' never once have I opened me lips but to say fine 
                things iv them an' him, God curse his soul! an' may he rot in 
                purgatory ten thousand years, an' then go down to the last an' 
                deepest hell iv all!' </p>
              <p>　　Johnson, the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard, 
                seemed the least equivocal of the men for'ard or aft. In fact, 
                there was nothing equivocal about him. One was struck at once 
                by his straightforwardness and manliness, which, in turn, were 
                tempered by a modesty which might be mistaken for timidity. But 
                timid he was not. He seemed rather to have the courage of his 
                convictions, the certitude of his manhood. It was this that made 
                him protest, at the beginning of our acquaintance, against being 
                called Yonson. And upon this and him Louis passed judgment and 
                prophecy. </p>
              <p>　　''T is a fine chap, that squarehead Johnson we've for'ard with 
                us,' he said. 'The best sailorman in the fo'c's'le. He's my boat-puller. 
                But it's to trouble he'll come with Wolf Larsen, as the sparks 
                fly upward. It's meself that knows. I can see it brewin' an' comin' 
                up like a storm in the sky. I've talked to him like a brother, 
                but it's little he sees in takin' in his lights or flyin' false 
                signals. He grumbles out when things don't go to suit him, an' 
                there'll be always some telltale carryin' word iv it aft to the 
                Wolf. The Wolf is strong, an' it's the way of a wolf to hate strength, 
                an' strength is is he'll see in Johnson- no knucklin' under, an' 
                a &quot;Yes, sir; thank ye kindly, sir,&quot; for a curse or a 
                blow. Oh, she's a-comin'! She's a-comin'! An' God knows where 
                I'll get another boat-puller. What does the fool up an' say, when 
                the Old Man calls him Yonson, but &quot;Me name is Johnson, sir,&quot; 
                and' then spells it out, letter for letter. Ye should iv seen 
                the Old Man's face! I thought he'd let drive at him on the spot. 
                He didn't, but he will, an' he'll break that squarehead's heart, 
                or it's little I know iv the ways iv men on the ships iv the sea.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable. I am compelled to 
                mister him and to sir him with every speech. One reason for this 
                is that Wolf Larsen seems to have taken a fancy to him. It is 
                an unprecedented thing, I take it, for a captain to be chummy 
                with the cook, but this is certainly what Wolf Larsen is doing. 
                Two or three times he put his head into the galley and chaffed 
                Mugridge good-naturedly, and once, this afternoon, he stood by 
                the break of the poop and chatted with him for fully fifteen minutes. 
                When it was over, and Mugridge was back in the galley, he became 
                greasily radiant and went about his work humming Coster songs 
                in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto. </p>
              <p>　　'I always get along with the officers,' he remarked to me in 
                a confidential tone. 'I know the w'y, I do, to myke myself uppreci-yted. 
                There was my last skipper- w'y, I thought nothin' of droppin' 
                down in the cabin for a little chat an' a friendly glass. &quot;Mugridge,&quot; 
                says 'e to me, &quot;Mugridge,&quot; says 'e, &quot;you've missed 
                yer vocytion.&quot; &quot;an' ow's that?&quot; says I. &quot;Yer 
                should' a' been born a gentleman, an' never 'ad to work for yer 
                livin'.&quot; God strike me dead, 'Ump, if that ayn't wot 'e says, 
                an' me a-sittin' there in 'is own cabin, jolly- like an' comfortable, 
                a-smokin' 'is cigars an' drinkin' 'is rum.' </p>
              <p>　　This chitter-chatter drove me to distraction. I never heard 
                a voice I hated so. His oily, insinuating tones, his greasy smile, 
                and his monstrous self-conceit grated on my nerves till sometimes 
                I was all in a tremble. Positively he was the most disgusting 
                and loathsome person I have ever met. The filth of his cooking 
                was indescribable; and as he cooked everything that was eaten 
                aboard, I was compelled to select with great circumspection what 
                I ate, choosing from the least dirty of his concoctions. </p>
              <p>　　My hands bothered me a great deal, unused as they were to work. 
                The nails were discolored and black, while the skin was already 
                grained with dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove. 
                Then blisters came, in a painful and never-ending procession, 
                and I had a great burn on my forearm, acquired by losing my balance 
                in a roll of the ship and pitching against the galley stove. Nor 
                was my knee any better. The swelling had not gone down, and the 
                cap was still up on edge. Hobbling about on it from morning to 
                night was not helping it any. What I needed was rest, if it were 
                ever to get well. </p>
              <p>　　Rest! I never before knew the meaning of the word. I had been 
                resting all my life and did not know it. But now could I sit still 
                for one half-hour and do nothing, not even think, it would be 
                the most pleasurable thing in the world. But it is a revelation, 
                on the other hand. I shall be able to appreciate the lives of 
                the working-people hereafter. I did not dream that work was so 
                terrible a thing. From half-past five in the morning till ten 
                o'clock at night I am everybody's slave, with not one moment to 
                myself except such as I can steal near the end of the second dog-watch. 
                Let me pause for a minute to look out over the sea sparkling in 
                the sun, or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the gaff topsails 
                or running out the bowsprit, and I am sure to hear the hateful 
                voice, ''Ere, you, 'Ump! No sodgerin'! I've got my peepers on 
                yer.' </p>
              <p>　　There are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage, and 
                the gossip is going around that Smoke and Henderson have had a 
                fight. Henderson seems the best of the hunters, a slow-going fellow 
                and hard to rouse; but roused he must have been for Smoke had 
                a bruised and discolored eye and looked particularly vicious when 
                he came into the cabin for supper. </p>
              <p>　　A cruel thing happened just before supper, indicative of the 
                callousness and brutishness of these men. There is one green hand 
                in the crew, Harrison by name, a clumsy-looking country boy, mastered, 
                I imagine, by the spirit of adventure, and making his first voyage. 
                In the light, baffling airs, the schooner has been tacking about 
                a great deal, at which times the sails pass from one side to the 
                other, and a man is sent aloft to shift over the fore-gaff topsail. 
              </p>
              <p>　　In some way, when Harrison was aloft, the sheet jammed in the 
                block through which it runs at the end of the gaff. As I understood 
                it, there were two ways of getting it cleared- first, by lowering 
                the foresail, which was comparatively easy and without danger; 
                and, second, by climbing out on the peak-halyards to the end of 
                the gaff itself, a very hazardous performance. </p>
              <p>　　Johansen called out to Harrison to go out on the halyards. 
                It was patent to everybody that the boy was afraid. And well he 
                might be, eighty feet above the deck, to trust himself on those 
                thin and jerking ropes. Had there been a steady breeze it would 
                not have been so bad, but the Ghost was rolling emptily in a long 
                sea, and with each roll the canvas flapped and boomed and the 
                halyards slacked and jerked taut. They were capable of snapping 
                a man off like a fly from a whiplash. </p>
              <p>　　Harrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of 
                him, but hesitated. It was probably the first time in his life 
                he had been aloft. Johansen, who had caught the contagion of Wolf 
                Larsen's masterfulness, burst out with a volley of abuse and curses. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'That'll do, Johansen!' Wolf Larsen said brusquely. 'I'll have 
                you know that I do the swearing on this ship. If I need your assistance, 
                I'll call you in.' </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, sir,' the mate acknowledged submissively. </p>
              <p>　　In the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards. I 
                was looking up from the galley door, and I could see him trembling 
                in every limb as with ague. He proceeded very slowly and cautiously, 
                an inch at a time. Outlined against the clear blue of the sky, 
                he had the appearance of an enormous spider crawling along the 
                tracery of its web. </p>
              <p>　　It was a slightly uphill climb, for the foresail peaked high; 
                and the halyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and 
                mast, gave him separate holds for hands and feet. But the trouble 
                lay in that the wind was not strong enough or steady enough to 
                keep the sail full. When he was halfway out, the Ghost took a 
                long roll to windward and back again into the hollow between two 
                seas. Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly. Eighty 
                feet beneath I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as 
                he gripped for very life. </p>
              <p>　　The sail emptied and the gaff swung amidships. The halyards 
                slackened, and, though it all happened very quickly, I could see 
                them sag beneath the weight of his body. Then the gaff swung to 
                the side with an abrupt swiftness, the great sail boomed like 
                a cannon, and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the 
                canvas like a volley of rifles. Harrison, clinging on, made the 
                giddy rush through the air. This rush ceased abruptly. The halyards 
                became instantly taut. It was the snap of the whip. His clutch 
                was broken. One hand was torn loose from its hold. The other lingered 
                desperately for a moment, and followed. His body pitched out and 
                down, but in some way he managed to save himself with his legs. 
                He was hanging by them, head downward. A quick effort brought 
                his hands up to the halyards again; but he was a long time regaining 
                his former position, where he hung, a pitiable object. </p>
              <p>　　'I'll bet he has no appetite for supper,' I heard Wolf Larsen's 
                voice, which came to me from around the corner of the galley. 
                'Look at his gills.' </p>
              <p>　　In truth Harrison was very sick, as a person is seasick; and 
                for a long time clung to his precarious perch without attempting 
                to move. Johansen, however, continued violently to urge him on 
                to the completion of his task. </p>
              <p>　　'It is a shame,' I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow 
                and correct English. He was standing by the main rigging, a few 
                feet away from me. 'The boy is willing enough. He will learn if 
                he has a chance. But this- ' He paused a while, for the word 'murder' 
                was his final judgment. </p>
              <p>　　'Hist, will ye!' Louis whispered to him. 'For the love iv your 
                mother, hold your mouth!' </p>
              <p>　　But Johnson, looking on, still continued his grumbling. </p>
              <p>　　'Look here,'- the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen,- 'that's 
                my boat-puller, and I don't want to lose him.' </p>
              <p>　　'That's all right, Standish,' was the reply. 'He's your boat-puller 
                when you've got him in the boat, but he's my sailor when I have 
                him aboard, and I'll do what I well please with him.' </p>
              <p>　　'But that's no reason- ' Standish began in a torrent of speech. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'That'll do; easy as she goes,' Wolf Larsen counseled back. 
                'I've told you what's what, and let it stop at that. The man's 
                mine, and I'll make soup of him and eat it if I want to.' </p>
              <p>　　There was an angry gleam in the hunter's eye, but he turned 
                on his heel and entered the steerage companionway, where he remained, 
                looking upward. All hands were on deck now, and all eyes were 
                aloft, where a human life was at grapples with death. The callousness 
                of these men, to whom industrial organization gave control of 
                the lives of other men, was appalling. I, who had lived out of 
                the whirl of the world, had never dreamed that its work was carried 
                on in such fashion. Life had always seemed a peculiarly sacred 
                thing; but here it counted for nothing, was a cipher in the arithmetic 
                of commerce. I must say, however, that the sailors themselves 
                were sympathetic, as instance the case of Johnson; but the masters 
                (the hunters and the captain) were heartlessly indifferent. Even 
                the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not 
                wish to lose his boat-puller. Had it been some other hunter's 
                boat-puller, he, like them, would have been no more than amused. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But to return to Harrison. It took Johansen, insulting and 
                reviling the poor wretch, fully ten minutes to get him started 
                again. A little later he made the end of the gaff, where, astride 
                the spar itself, he had a better chance for holding on. He cleared 
                the sheet, and was free to return, slightly downhill now, along 
                the halyards to the mast. But he had lost his nerve. Unsafe as 
                was his present position, he was loath to forsake it for the more 
                unsafe position on the halyards. </p>
              <p>　　He looked along the airy path he must traverse, and then down 
                to the deck. His eyes were wide and staring, and he was trembling 
                violently. I had never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human 
                face. Johansen called vainly for him to come down. At any moment 
                he was liable to be snapped off the gaff, but he was helpless 
                with fright. Wolf Larsen, walking up and down with Smoke and in 
                conversation, took no more notice of him, though he cried sharply, 
                once, to the man at the wheel: </p>
              <p>　　'You're off your course, my man! Be careful, unless you're 
                looking for trouble.' </p>
              <p>　　'Aye, aye, sir,' the helmsman responded, putting a couple of 
                spokes down. </p>
              <p>　　He had been guilty of running the Ghost several points off 
                her course, in order that what little wind there was should fill 
                the foresail and hold it steady. He had striven to help the unfortunate 
                Harrison at the risk of incurring Wolf Larsen's anger. </p>
              <p>　　The time went by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible. Thomas 
                Mugridge, on the other hand, considered it a laughable affair, 
                and was continually bobbing his head out of the galley door to 
                make jocose remarks. How I hated him! And how my hatred for him 
                grew and grew, during that fearful time, to cyclopean dimensions! 
                For the first time in my life I experienced the desire to murder- 
                'saw red,' as some of our picturesque writers phrase it. Life 
                in general might still be sacred, but life in the particular case 
                of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed. I was frightened 
                when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the thought 
                flashed through my mind: Was I, too, becoming tainted by the brutality 
                of my environment?- I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had 
                denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment. </p>
              <p>　　Fully half an hour went by, and then I saw Johnson and Louis 
                in some sort of altercation. It ended with Johnson flinging off 
                Louis's detaining arm and starting forward. He crossed the deck, 
                sprang into the fore rigging, and began to climb. But the quick 
                eye of Wolf Larsen caught him. </p>
              <p>　　'Here, you, what are you up to?' he cried. </p>
              <p>　　Johnson's ascent was arrested. He looked his captain in the 
                eyes and replied slowly: </p>
              <p>　　'I am going to get that boy down.' </p>
              <p>　　'You'll get down out of that rigging, and- lively about it! 
                D'ye hear! Get down!' </p>
              <p>　　Johnson hesitated, but the long years of obedience to the masters 
                of ships overpowered him, and he dropped sullenly to the deck 
                and went on forward. </p>
              <p>　　At half after five I went below to set the cabin table; but 
                I hardly knew what I did, for my eyes and brain were filled with 
                the vision of a man, white-faced and trembling, comically, like 
                a bug, clinging to the thrashing gaff. At six o'clock, when I 
                served supper, going on deck to get the food from the galley, 
                I saw Harrison, still in the same position. The conversation at 
                the table was of other things. Nobody seemed interested in the 
                wantonly imperiled life. But, making an extra trip to the galley 
                a little later, I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison staggering 
                weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle. He had finally 
                summoned the courage to descend. </p>
              <p>　　Before closing this incident, I must give a scrap of conversation 
                I had with Wolf Larsen in the cabin, while I was washing the dishes. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'You were looking squeamish this afternoon,' he began. 'What 
                was the matter?' </p>
              <p>　　I could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick 
                as Harrison, that he was trying to draw me, and I answered: 'It 
                was because of the brutal treatment of that boy.' </p>
              <p>　　He gave a short laugh. 'Like seasickness, I suppose. Some men 
                are subject to it, and others are not.' </p>
              <p>　　'Not so,' I objected. </p>
              <p>　　'Just so,' he went on. 'The earth is as full of brutality as 
                the sea is full of motion. And some men are made sick by the one, 
                and some by the other. That's the only reason.' </p>
              <p>　　'But you who make a mock of human life, don't you place any 
                value upon it whatever?' I demanded. </p>
              <p>　　'Value? What value? He looked at me, and though his eyes were 
                steady and motionless, there seemed a cynical smile in them. 'What 
                kind of value? How do you measure it? Who values it?' </p>
              <p>　　'I do,' I made answer. </p>
              <p>　　'Then what is it worth to you? Another man's life, I mean. 
                Come, now, what is it worth?' </p>
              <p>　　The value of life? How could I put a tangible value upon it? 
                Somehow I, who have always had expression, lacked expression when 
                with Wolf Larsen. I have since determined that a part of it was 
                due to the man's personality, but that the greater part was due 
                to his totally different outlook. Unlike other materialists I 
                had met, and with whom I had something in common to start on, 
                I had nothing in common with him. Perhaps, also, it was the elemental 
                simplicity of his mind that baffled me. He drove so directly to 
                the core of the matter, divesting a question always of all superfluous 
                details, and with such an air of finality, that I seemed to find 
                myself struggling in deep water with no footing under me. Value 
                of life? How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? 
                The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic. That it was 
                intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned. But 
                when he challenged the truism I was speechless. </p>
              <p>　　'We were talking about this yesterday,' he said. 'I held that 
                life was a ferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that 
                it might live, and that living was merely successful piggishness. 
                Why, if there is anything in supply and demand, life is the cheapest 
                thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, 
                so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. 
                Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of 
                eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the 
                possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and 
                opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn 
                life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and 
                populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things 
                it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills 
                it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she 
                sows a thousand lives, and it's life eat life till the strongest 
                and most piggish life is left.' </p>
              <p>　　'You have read Darwin,' I said. 'But you read him misunderstandingly 
                when you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your 
                wanton destruction of life.' </p>
              <p>　　He shrugged his shoulders. 'You know you only mean that in 
                relation to human life, for of the flesh and the fowl and the 
                fish you destroy as much as I or any other man. And human life 
                is in no wise different, though you feel it is and think that 
                you reason why it is. Why should I be parsimonious with this life 
                which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than 
                there are ships on the sea for them, more workers than there are 
                factories or machines for them. Why, you who live on the land 
                know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and 
                loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remain 
                more poor people, dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit 
                of meat (which is life destroyed), than you know what to do with. 
                Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts 
                for a chance to work?' </p>
              <p>　　He started for the companion-stairs, but turned his head for 
                a final word. 'Do you know, the only value life has is what life 
                puts upon itself; and it is of course overestimated, since it 
                is of necessity prejudiced in its own favor. Take that man I had 
                aloft. He held on as if he were a precious thing, a treasure beyond 
                diamonds or rubies. To you? No. To me? Not at all. To himself, 
                yes. But I do not accept his estimate. He sadly overrates himself. 
                There is plenty more life demanding to be born. Had he fallen 
                and dripped his brains upon the deck like honey from the comb, 
                there would have been no loss to the world. He was worth nothing 
                to the world. The supply is too large. To himself only was he 
                of value, and to show how fictitious even this value was, being 
                dead, he is unconscious that he has lost himself. He alone rated 
                himself beyond diamonds and rubies. Diamonds and rubies are gone, 
                spread out on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water, 
                and he does not even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone. 
                He does not lose anything, for with the loss of himself he loses 
                the knowledge of loss. Don't you see? And what have you to say?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'That you are at least consistent,' was all I could say, and 
                I went on washing the dishes.</p>

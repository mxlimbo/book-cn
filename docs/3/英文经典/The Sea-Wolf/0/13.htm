<p>　　FOR THREE DAYS I DID MY OWN work and Thomas Mugridge's too, 
                and I flatter myself that I did his work well. I know that it 
                won Wolf Larsen's approval, while the sailors beamed with satisfaction 
                during the brief time my regime lasted. </p>
              <p>　　'The first clean bite since I come aboard Harrison said to 
                me at the galley door, as he returned the dinner pots and pans 
                from the forecastle. 'Somehow, Tommy's grub always tastes of grease,- 
                stale grease,- and I reckon he ain't changed his shirt since he 
                left 'Frisco.' </p>
              <p>　　'I know he hasn't,' I answered. </p>
              <p>　　'And I'll bet he sleeps in it,' Harrison added. </p>
              <p>　　'And you won't lose,' I agreed. 'The same shirt, and he hasn't 
                had it off once in all this time.' </p>
              <p>　　But three days were all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to 
                recover from the effects of the beating. On the fourth day, lame 
                and sore, scarcely able to see, so closed were his eyes, he was 
                haled from his bunk by the nape of the neck and set to his duty. 
                He sniffled and wept, but Wolf Larsen was pitiless. </p>
              <p>　　'And see that you serve no more slops,' was his parting injunction. 
                'No more grease and dirt, mind, and a clean shirt occasionally, 
                or you'll get a tow over the side. Understand?' </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor, and 
                a short lurch of the Ghost sent him staggering. In attempting 
                to recover himself, he reached for the iron railing which surrounded 
                the stove and kept the pots from sliding off; but his missed the 
                railing, and his hand, with his weight behind it, landed squarely 
                on the hot surface. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, Gawd, Gawd, wot 'ave I done?' he wailed, sitting down 
                in the coalbox and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth. 
                'W'y 'as all this come on me? It mykes me fair sick, it does, 
                an' I try so 'ard to go through life harmless an' 'urtin' nobody.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　The tears were running down his puffed and discolored cheeks, 
                and his face was drawn with pain. A savage expression flitted 
                across it. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, 'ow I 'ate 'im! 'Ow I 'ate 'im!' he gritted out. </p>
              <p>　　'Whom?' I asked; but the poor wretch was weeping again over 
                his misfortunes. Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated 
                than whom he did not hate; for I had come to see a malignant devil 
                in him which impelled him to hate all the world. I sometimes thought 
                that he hated even himself, so grotesquely had life dealt with 
                him, and so monstrously. At such moments a great sympathy welled 
                up within me, and I felt shame that I had ever joyed in his discomfiture 
                or pain. Life had been unfair to him. It had played him a scurvy 
                trick when it fashioned him into the thing he was, and it had 
                played him scurvy tricks ever since. What chance had he to be 
                anything else than what he was? And as though answering my unspoken 
                thought, he wailed: </p>
              <p>　　'I never 'ad no chance, nor 'arf a chance! 'Oo was there to 
                send me to school, or put tommy in my 'ungry bell w'en I was a 
                kiddy? 'Oo ever did anything for me, heh? 'oo, I s'y?' </p>
              <p>　　'Never mind, Tommy,' I said, placing a soothing hand on his 
                shoulder. 'Cheer up. It'll all come right in the end. You've long 
                years before you, and you can make anything you please of yourself.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It's a lie!' he shouted in my face, flinging off the hand. 
                'It's a lie, an' you know it. I'm already myde, an' myde out of 
                leavin's an' scraps. It's all right for you, 'Ump. You was born 
                a gentleman. You never knew wot it was to go 'ungry, to cry yerself 
                asleep with a gnawin' an' gnawin', like a rat, inside yer. It 
                carn't come right. If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer, 
                low would it fill my belly for one time w'en I was a kiddy an' 
                it went empty? </p>
              <p>　　''Ow could it, I s'y? I was born to sufferin' and' sorrer. 
                I've 'ad more cruel sufferin' than any ten men, I 'ave. I've been 
                in 'orspital 'arf my bleedin' life. I've 'ad the fever in Aspinwall, 
                in 'Avana, in New Orleans. I near died of the scurvy, an' rotten 
                with it six months in Barbados. Smallpox in 'Onolulu, two broken 
                legs in Shanghai, pneumonia in Unalaska, three busted ribs an' 
                my insides all twisted in 'Frisco. An' 'ere I am now. Look at 
                me! Look at me! My ribs kicked loose from my back again. I'll 
                be coughin' blood before eyght bells. 'Ow can it be myde up to 
                me, I arsk? 'Oo's goin' to do it? Gawd? 'Ow Gawd must 'ave 'ated 
                me w'en 'e signed me on for a voyage in this bloomin' world of 
                'is!' </p>
              <p>　　This tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more, and 
                then he buckled to his work, limping and groaning, and in his 
                eyes a great hatred for all created things. </p>
              <p>　　Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and 
                went about his work in a half-hearted way. He was still a sick 
                man, and I more than once observed him creeping painfully aloft 
                to a topsail or drooping wearily as he stood at the wheel. But, 
                still worse, it seemed that his spirit was broken. He was abject 
                before Wolf Larsen, and almost groveled to Johansen. Not so Leach. 
                He went about the deck like a tiger-cub, glaring his hatred openly 
                at Wolf Larsen and Johansen. </p>
              <p>　　'I'll do for you yet, you slab-footed Swede.' I heard him say 
                to Johansen one night on deck. </p>
              <p>　　The mate cursed him in the darkness, and the next moment some 
                missile struck the galley a sharp rap. There was more cursing, 
                and a mocking laugh, and when all was quiet I stole outside and 
                found a heavy knife embedded over an inch in the solid wood. A 
                few minutes later the mate came fumbling about in search of it, 
                but I returned it privily to Leach next day. He grinned when I 
                handed it over, yet it was a grin that contained more sincere 
                thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of speech common to 
                the members of my own class. </p>
              <p>　　Unlike any one else in the ship's company, I now found myself 
                with no quarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all. The 
                hunters possibly no more than tolerated me, though none of them 
                disliked me; while Smoke and Henderson, convalescent under a deck 
                awning and swinging day and night in their hammocks, assured me 
                that I was better than any hospital nurse, and that they would 
                not forget me at the end of the voyage when they were paid off. 
                As though I stood in need of their money- I, who could have bought 
                them out, bag and baggage, and the schooner and its equipment, 
                a hundred times over! But upon me had devolved the task of tending 
                their wounds and pulling them through, and I did my best by them. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache, which 
                lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he called 
                me in and obeyed my commands like a sick child. But nothing I 
                could do seemed to relieve him. At my suggestion, however, he 
                gave up smoking and drinking, though why so magnificent an animal 
                as he should have headaches at all puzzled me. </p>
              <p>　　''T is the hand of God, I'm tellin' you,' was the way Louis 
                saw it. ''T is a visitation for his black-hearted deeds, an' there's 
                more behind an' comin', or else-' </p>
              <p>　　'Or else,' I prompted. </p>
              <p>　　'God is noddin' an' not doin' his duty, though it's me as shouldn't 
                say it.' I was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces 
                of all. Not only did Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me, but 
                he had discovered a new reason for hating me. It took me no little 
                while to puzzle it out, but I finally discovered that it was because 
                I was more luckily born than he- 'gentleman born,' he put it. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'And still no more dead men,' I twitted Louis, when Smoke and 
                Henderson, side by side, in friendly conversation, took their 
                first exercise on deck. </p>
              <p>　　Louis surveyed me with his shrewd gray eyes and shook his head 
                portentously. </p>
              <p>　　'She's a-comin', I tell you, an' it'll be sheets an' halyards, 
                stand by all hands, when she begins to howl. I've had the feel 
                iv it this long time, an' I can feel it now as plainly as I feel 
                the riggin' iv a dark night. She's close, she's close.' </p>
              <p>　　'Who goes first?' I queried. </p>
              <p>　　'Not old fat Louis, I promise you,' he laughed. 'For 't is 
                in the bones iv me I know that come this time next year I'll be 
                gazin' in the old mother's eyes, weary with watchin' iv the sea 
                for the five sons she gave to it.' </p>
              <p>　　'Wot's'e been s'yin' to yer?' Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment 
                later. </p>
              <p>　　'That he's going home some day to see his mother,' I answered 
                diplomatically. </p>
              <p>　　'I never 'ad none,' was the Cockney's comment, as he gazed 
                with lusterless, hopeless eyes into mine.</p>

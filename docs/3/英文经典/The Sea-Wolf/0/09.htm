              <p>　　THREE DAYS OF REST, THREE blessed days of rest, are what I 
                had with Wolf Larsen, eating at the cabin table and doing nothing 
                but discuss life, literature, and the universe, the while Thomas 
                Mugridge fumed and raged and did my work as well as his own. </p>
              <p>　　'Watch out for squalls, is all I can say to you,' was Louis's 
                warning, given during a spare half-hour on deck while Wolf Larsen 
                was engaged in straightening out a row among the hunters. </p>
              <p>　　'Ye can't tell what'll be happenin',' Louis went on, in response 
                to my query for more definite information. 'The man's as contrary 
                as air-currents or water-currents. You can never guess the ways 
                iv him. 'T is just as you're thinkin' you know him an' are makin' 
                a favorable slant along him that he whirls around, dead ahead, 
                an' comes howlin' down upon you an' a-rippin' all iv your fine-weather 
                sails to rags.' </p>
              <p>　　So I was not altogether surprised when the squall foretold 
                by Louis smote me. We had been having a heated discussion,- upon 
                life, of course,- and, grown overbold, I was passing stiff strictures 
                upon Wolf Larsen and the life of Wolf Larsen. In fact, I was vivisecting 
                him and turning over his soul-stuff as keenly and thoroughly as 
                it was his custom to do it to others. It may be a weakness of 
                mine that I have an incisive way of speech, but I threw all restraint 
                to the winds and cut and slashed until the whole man of him was 
                snarling. The dark sun-bronze of his face went black with wrath; 
                his eyes became ablaze. There was no clearness or sanity in them- 
                nothing but the terrific rage of a madman. It was the wolf in 
                him that I saw, and a mad wolf at that. </p>
              <p>　　He sprang for me with a half-roar, gripping my arm. I had steeled 
                myself to brazen it out, though I was trembling inwardly; but 
                the enormous strength of the man was too much for my fortitude. 
                He had gripped me by the biceps with his single hand, and when 
                that grip tightened I wilted and shrieked aloud. My feet went 
                out from under me. I simply could not stand upright and endure 
                the agony. The muscles refused their duty. The pain was too great. 
                My biceps was being crushed to a pulp. </p>
              <p>　　He seemed to recover himself, for a lurid gleam came into his 
                eyes, and he relaxed his hold with a short laugh that was more 
                like a growl. I fell to the floor, feeling very faint, while he 
                sat down, lighted a cigar, and watched me as a cat watches a mouse. 
                As I writhed about I could see in his eyes that curiosity I had 
                so often noted, that wonder and perplexity, that questing, that 
                everlasting query of his as to what it was all about. </p>
              <p>　　I finally crawled to my feet and ascended the companion-stairs. 
                Fair weather was over, and there was nothing left but to return 
                to the galley. My left arm was numb, as though paralyzed, and 
                days passed before I could use it, while weeks went by before 
                the last stiffness and pain went out of it. And he had done nothing 
                but put his hand upon my arm and squeeze. There had been no wrenching 
                or jerking. He had just closed his hand with a steady pressure. 
                What he might have done I did not fully realize till next day, 
                when he put his head into the galley, and, as a sign of renewed 
                friendliness, asked me how my arm was getting on. </p>
              <p>　　'It might have been worse,' he smiled. </p>
              <p>　　I was peeling potatoes. He picked one up from the pan. It was 
                fair-sized, firm, and unpeeled. He closed his hand upon it, squeezed, 
                and the potato squirted out between his fingers in mushy streams. 
                The pulpy remnant he dropped back into the pan and turned away, 
                and I had a sharp vision of how it might have fared with me had 
                the monster put his strength upon me. </p>
              <p>　　But the three days' rest was good, in spite of it all, for 
                it had given my knee the very chance it needed. It felt much better, 
                the swelling had materially decreased, and the cap seemed descending 
                into its proper place. Also, the three days' rest brought the 
                trouble I had foreseen. It was plainly Thomas Mugridge's intention 
                to make me pay for those three days. He treated me vilely, cursed 
                me continually, and heaped his own work upon me. He even ventured 
                to raise his fist to me, but I was becoming animal-like myself, 
                and I snarled in his face so terribly that it must have frightened 
                him back. It is no pleasant picture I can conjure up of myself, 
                Humphrey Van Weyden, in that noisome ship's galley, crouched in 
                a corner over my task, my face raised to the face of the creature 
                about to strike me, my lips lifted and snarling like a dog's, 
                my eyes gleaming with fear and helplessness and the courage that 
                comes of fear and helplessness. I do not like the picture. It 
                reminds me too strongly of a rat in a trap. I do not care to think 
                of it; but it was effective, for the threatened blow did not descend. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge backed away, glaring as hatefully and viciously 
                as I glared. A pair of beasts is what we were, penned together 
                and showing our teeth. He was a coward, afraid to strike me because 
                I had not quailed sufficiently in advance; so he chose a new way 
                to intimidate me. There was only one galley knife that as a knife 
                amounted to anything. This, through many years of service and 
                wear, had acquired a long, lean blade. It was unusually cruel-looking, 
                and at first I had shuddered every time I used it. The cook borrowed 
                a stone from Johansen and proceeded to sharpen the knife. He did 
                it with great ostentation, glancing significantly at me the while. 
                He whetted it up and down all day long. Every odd moment he could 
                find he had the knife and stone out and was whetting away. The 
                steel acquired a razor-edge. He tried it with the ball of his 
                thumb or across the nail, he shaved hairs from the back of his 
                hand, glanced along the edge with microscopic acuteness, and found, 
                or feigned that he found, always, a slight inequality in its edge 
                somewhere. Then he would put it on the stone again, and whet, 
                whet, whet, till I could have laughed aloud, it was so very ludicrous. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was also serious, for I learned that he was capable of using 
                it, that under all his cowardice there was a courage of cowardice, 
                like mine, that would impel him to do the very thing his whole 
                nature protested against doing and was afraid of doing. 'Cooky's 
                sharpening his knife for Hump,' was being whispered about among 
                the sailors, and some of them twitted him about it. This he took 
                in good part, and was really pleased, nodding his head with direful 
                foreknowledge and mystery, until George Leach, the erstwhile cabin-boy, 
                ventured some rough pleasantry on the subject. </p>
              <p>　　Now it happened that Leach was one of the sailors told off 
                to douse Mugridge after his game of cards with the captain. Leach 
                had evidently done his task with a thoroughness that Mugridge 
                had not forgiven, for words followed, and evil names involving 
                smirched ancestries. Mugridge menaced with the knife he was sharpening 
                for me. Leach laughed and hurled more of his Telegraph Hill billingsgate, 
                and before either he or I knew what had happened, his right forearm 
                had been ripped open from elbow to wrist by a quick slash of the 
                knife. The cook backed away, a fiendish expression on his face, 
                the knife held before him in a position of defense. But Leach 
                took it quite calmly, though his blood was spouting upon the deck 
                as generously as water from a fountain. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm goin' to get you, Cooky,' he said, 'and I'll get you hard. 
                And I won't be in no hurry about it. You'll be without that knife 
                when I come for you.' </p>
              <p>　　So saying, he turned and walked quietly forward. Mugridge's 
                face was livid with fear at what he had done and at what he might 
                expect sooner or later from the man he had stabbed. But his demeanor 
                toward me was more ferocious than ever. In spite of his fear at 
                the reckoning he must expect to pay for what he had done, he could 
                see that it had been an object-lesson to me, and he became more 
                domineering and exultant. Also, there was a lust in him, akin 
                to madness, which had come with sight of the blood he had drawn. 
                He was beginning to see red in whatever direction he looked. The 
                psychology of it is sadly tangled, and yet I could read the workings 
                of his mind as clearly as though it were a printed book. </p>
              <p>　　Several days went by, the Ghost still foaming down the trades, 
                and I could swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge's eyes. 
                And I confess that I became afraid, very much afraid. Whet, whet, 
                whet, it went, all day long. The look in his eyes as he felt the 
                keen edge and glared at me was positively carnivorous. I was afraid 
                to turn my shoulder to him, and when I left the galley I went 
                out backward- to the amusement of the sailors and hunters, who 
                made a point of gathering in groups to witness my exit. The strain 
                was too great. I sometimes thought my mind would give way under 
                it- a meet thing on this ship of madmen and brutes. Every hour, 
                every minute, of my existence was in jeopardy. I was a human soul 
                in distress, and yet no soul, fore or aft, betrayed sufficient 
                sympathy to come to my aid. At times I thought of throwing myself 
                on the mercy of Wolf Larsen; but the vision of the mocking devil 
                in his eyes that questioned life and sneered at it would come 
                strong upon me and compel me to refrain. At other times I seriously 
                contemplated suicide, and the whole force of my hopeful philosophy 
                was required to keep me from going over the side in the darkness 
                of night. </p>
              <p>　　Several times Wolf Larsen tried to inveigle me into discussion, 
                but I gave him short answers and eluded him. Finally, he commanded 
                me to resume my seat at the cabin table for a time and let the 
                cook do my work. Then I spoke frankly, telling him what I was 
                enduring from Thomas Mugridge because of the three days of favoritism 
                which had been shown me. Wolf Larsen regarded me with smiling 
                eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'So you're afraid, eh?' he sneered. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes,' I said defiantly and honestly, 'I am afraid.' </p>
              <p>　　'That's the way with you fellows,' he cried half angrily; 'sentimentalizing 
                about your immortal souls, and afraid to die. At sight of a sharp 
                knife and a cowardly Cockney, the clinging of life to life overcomes 
                all your fond foolishness. Why, my dear fellow, you will live 
                forever. You are a god, and a god cannot be killed. Cooky cannot 
                hurt you. You are sure of your resurrection. What's there to be 
                afraid of? </p>
              <p>　　'You have eternal life before you. You are a millionaire in 
                immortality, a millionaire whose fortune cannot be lost, whose 
                fortune is less perishable than the stars and as lasting as space 
                or time. It is impossible for you to diminish your principal. 
                Immortality is a thing without beginning or end. Eternity is eternity, 
                and though you die here and now, you will go on living somewhere 
                else and hereafter. And it is all very beautiful, this shaking 
                off of the flesh and soaring of the imprisoned spirit. Cooky cannot 
                hurt you. He can only give you a boost on the path you eternally 
                must tread. </p>
              <p>　　'Or, if you do not wish to be boosted just yet, why not boost 
                Cooky? According to your ideas, he too must be an immortal millionaire. 
                You cannot bankrupt him. His paper will always circulate at par. 
                You cannot diminish the length of his living by killing him, for 
                he is without beginning or end. He's bound to go on living, somewhere, 
                somehow. Then boost him. Stick a knife in him and let his spirit 
                free. As it is, it's in a nasty prison, and you'll do him only 
                a kindness by breaking down the door. And who knows? It may be 
                a very beautiful spirit that will go soaring up into the blue 
                from that ugly carcass. Boost him along, and I'll promote you 
                to his place, and he's getting forty-five dollars a month.' </p>
              <p>　　It was plain that I could look for no help or mercy from Wolf 
                Larsen. Whatever was to be done I must do for myself; and out 
                of the courage of fear I evolved the plan of fighting Thomas Mugridge 
                with his own weapons. I borrowed a whetstone from Johansen. Louis, 
                the boat-steerer, had already begged me for condensed milk and 
                sugar. The lazaret, where such delicacies were stored, was situated 
                beneath the cabin floor. Watching my chance, I stole five cans 
                of the milk, and that night, when it was Louis's watch on deck, 
                I traded them with him for a dirk, as lean and cruel-looking as 
                Thomas Mugridge's vegetable-knife. It was rusty and dull, but 
                I turned the grindstone while Louis gave it an edge. I slept more 
                soundly than usual that night. </p>
              <p>　　Next morning, after breakfast, Thomas Mugridge began his whet, 
                whet, whet. I glanced warily at him, for I was on my knees taking 
                the ashes from the stove. When I returned from throwing them overside, 
                he was talking to Harrison, whose honest yokel's face was filled 
                with fascination and wonder. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes,' Mugridge was saying, 'an' wot does 'is worship do but 
                give me two years in Reading. But blimey if I cared. The other 
                mug was fixed plenty. Should 'a' seen 'im. Knife just like this.' 
                He shot a glance in my direction to see if I was taking it in, 
                and went on with a gory narrative of his prowess. </p>
              <p>　　A call from the mate interrupted him, and Harrison went aft. 
                Mugridge sat down on the raised threshold to the galley and went 
                on with his knife-sharpening. I put the shovel away and calmly 
                sat down on the coal-box, facing him. He favored me with a vicious 
                stare. Still calmly, though my heart was going pit-a-pat, I pulled 
                out Louis's dirk and began to whet it on the stone. I had looked 
                for almost any sort of explosion on the Cockney's part, but, to 
                my surprise, he did not appear aware of what I was doing. He went 
                on whetting his knife; so did I; and for two hours we sat there, 
                face to face, whet, whet, the news of it spread abroad, and half 
                the ship's company was crowding the galley doors to see the sight. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Encouragement and advice were freely tendered, and Jock Horner, 
                the quiet, soft-spoken hunter who looked as though he would not 
                harm a mouse, advised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust 
                upward, at the same time giving what he called the 'Spanish twist' 
                to the blade. Leach, his bandaged arm prominently to the fore, 
                begged me to leave a few remnants of the cook for him, and Wolf 
                Larsen paused once or twice at the break of the poop to glance 
                curiously at what must have been to him a stirring and crawling 
                of the yeasty thing he knew as life. </p>
              <p>　　And I make free to say that for the time being life assumed 
                the same sordid values to me. There was nothing pretty about it, 
                nothing divine- only two cowardly moving things that sat whetting 
                steel upon stone, and a group of other moving things, cowardly 
                and otherwise, that looked on. Half of them, I am sure, were anxious 
                to see us shedding each other's blood. It would have been entertainment. 
                And I do not think there was one who would have interfered had 
                we closed in a death-struggle. </p>
              <p>　　On the other hand, the whole thing was laughable and childish. 
                Whet, whet, whet- Humphrey Van Weyden sharpening his knife in 
                a ship's galley and trying its edge with his thumb. Of all situations 
                this was the most inconceivable. I know that my own kind could 
                not have believed it possible. I had not been called 'Sissy' Van 
                Weyden all my days without reason, and that 'Sissy' Van Weyden 
                should be capable of doing this thing was a revelation to Humphrey 
                Van Weyden, who knew not whether to be exultant or ashamed. </p>
              <p>　　But nothing happened. At the end of two hours Thomas Mugridge 
                put away knife and stone and held out his hand. </p>
              <p>　　'Wot's the good of mykin' a 'oly show of ourselves for them 
                mugs?' he demanded. 'They don't love us, an' bloody well glad 
                they'd be a-seein' us cuttin' our throats. Yer not 'arf bad, 'Ump. 
                You've got spunk, as you Yanks s'y, an' I like yer in a w'y. So 
                come on an' shyke.' </p>
              <p>　　Coward that I might be, I was less a coward than he. It was 
                a distinct victory I had gained, and I refused to forego any of 
                it by shaking his detestable hand. </p>
              <p>　　'All right,' he said pridelessly; 'tyke it or leave it. I'll 
                like yer none the less for it.' And, to save his face, he turned 
                fiercely upon the onlookers. 'Get outer my galley door, you bloomin' 
                swabs!' </p>
              <p>　　This command was reinforced by a steaming kettle of water, 
                and at sight of it the sailors scrambled out of the way. This 
                was a sort of victory for Thomas Mugridge and enabled him to accept 
                more gracefully the defeat I had given him, though, of course, 
                he was too discreet to attempt to drive the hunters away. </p>
              <p>　　'I see Cooky's finish,' I heard Smoke say to Horner. </p>
              <p>　　'You bet,' was the reply. 'Hump runs the galley from now on, 
                and Cooky pulls in his horns.' </p>
              <p>　　Mugridge heard and shot a swift glance at me, but I gave no 
                sign that the conversation had reached me. I had not thought my 
                victory was so far-reaching and complete, but I resolved to let 
                go nothing I had gained. As the days went by, Smoke's prophecy 
                was verified. The Cockney became more humble and slavish to me 
                than even to Wolf Larsen. I mistered him and sirred him no longer, 
                washed no more greasy pots, and peeled no more potatoes. I did 
                my own work, and my own work only, and when and in what fashion 
                I saw fit. Also, I carried the dirk in a sheath at my hip, sailor-fashion, 
                and maintained toward Thomas Mugridge a constant attitude which 
                was composed of equal parts of domineering, insult, and contempt.

              <p>　　WE WAITED ALL DAY FOR WOLF Larsen to come ashore. It was an 
                intolerable period of anxiety. Each moment one or the other of 
                us cast expectant glances toward the Ghost. But he did not come. 
                He did not even appear on deck. </p>
              <p>　　'Perhaps it is his headache,' I said. 'I left him lying on 
                the poop. He may lie there all night. I think I'll go and see.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Maud looked entreaty at me. </p>
              <p>　　'It is all right,' I assured her. 'I shall take the revolvers. 
                You know, I collected every weapon on board.' </p>
              <p>　　'But there are his arms, his hands, his terrible, terrible 
                hands,' she objected. And then she cried, 'Oh, Humphrey, I am 
                afraid of him. Don't go! Please don't go!' </p>
              <p>　　She rested her hand appealingly on mine and sent my pulse fluttering. 
                My heart was surely in my eyes for a moment. The dear and lovely 
                woman! And she was so much the woman, clinging and appealing, 
                sunshine and dew to my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending 
                through it the sap of a new strength. I was for putting my arm 
                around her, as when in the midst of the seal-herd, but I considered 
                and refrained. </p>
              <p>　　'I shall not take any risks,' I said. 'I'll merely peep over 
                the bow and see.' She pressed my hand earnestly and let me go. 
                But the space on deck where I had left him lying was vacant. He 
                had evidently gone below. That night we stood alternate watches, 
                one of us sleeping at a time; for there was no telling what Wolf 
                Larsen might do. </p>
              <p>　　The next day we waited, and the next, and still he made no 
                sign. </p>
              <p>　　'These headaches of his, these attacks-' Maude said, on the 
                afternoon of the fourth day. 'Perhaps he is ill, very ill. He 
                may be dead.' </p>
              <p>　　'Or dying,' was her afterthought, when she had waited some 
                time for me to speak. </p>
              <p>　　'Better so,' I answered. </p>
              <p>　　'But think, Humphrey- a fellow creature in his last lonely 
                hour!' </p>
              <p>　　'Perhaps,' I suggested. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, even perhaps,' she acknowledged. 'But we do not know. 
                It would be terrible if he were. I could never forgive myself. 
                We must do something.' </p>
              <p>　　'Perhaps,' I suggested again. </p>
              <p>　　I waited, smiling inwardly at the woman of her which compelled 
                a solicitude for Wolf Larsen, of all creatures. Where was her 
                solicitude for me? I thought- for me whom she had been afraid 
                to have merely peep aboard? </p>
              <p>　　She was too subtle not to follow the trend of my silence. And 
                she was as direct as she was subtle. </p>
              <p>　　'You must go aboard, Humphrey, and find out,' she said. 'And 
                if you want to laugh at me you have my consent and forgiveness.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I arose obediently and went down the beach. </p>
              <p>　　'Do be careful,' she called after me. </p>
              <p>　　I waved by arm from the forecastle-head and dropped down to 
                the deck. Aft I walked to the cabin companion, where I contented 
                myself with hailing below. Wolf Larsen answered, and as he started 
                to ascend the stairs I cocked my revolver. I displayed it openly 
                during our conversation, but he took no notice of it. He appeared 
                the same, physically, as when last I saw him, but he was gloomy 
                and silent. In fact, the few words we spoke could hardly be called 
                a conversation. I did not inquire why he had not been ashore, 
                nor did he ask why I had not come aboard. His head was all right 
                again, he said; and so, without further parley, I left him. </p>
              <p>　　Maud received my report with obvious relief, and the sight 
                of smoke which later rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful 
                mood. The next day, and the next, we saw the galley smoke rising, 
                and sometimes we caught glimpses of him on the poop. But that 
                was all. He made no attempt to come ashore. This we knew, for 
                we still maintained our night watches. We were waiting for him 
                to do something,- to show his hand, so to say,- and his inaction 
                puzzled and worried us. </p>
              <p>　　A week of this passed by. We had no other interest than Wolf 
                Larsen, and his presence weighed us down with an apprehension 
                which prevented us from doing any of the little things we had 
                planned. </p>
              <p>　　But at the end of the week the smoke ceased rising from the 
                galley, and he no longer showed himself on the poop. I could see 
                Maud's solicitude again growing, though she timidly- and even 
                proudly, I think- forbore a repetition of her request. After all, 
                what censure could be put upon her? Besides, I myself was aware 
                of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill dying 
                alone with his fellow creatures so near. He was right. The code 
                of my group was stronger than I. The fact that he had hands, feet, 
                and a body shaped somewhat like mine constituted a claim that 
                I could not ignore. </p>
              <p>　　So I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me. I discovered 
                that we stood in need of condensed milk and marmalade, and announced 
                that I was going aboard. I could see that she wavered. She even 
                went so far as to murmur that they were non-essentials and that 
                my trip after them might be inexpedient. And, as she had followed 
                the trend of my silence, she now followed the trend of my speech; 
                and she knew that I was going aboard, not because of condensed 
                milk and marmalade, but because of her and of her anxiety, which 
                she knew she had failed to hide. </p>
              <p>　　I took off my shoes when I gained the forecastle-head, and 
                went noiselessly aft in my stocking feet. Nor did I call this 
                time from the top of the companionway. Cautiously descending, 
                I found the cabin deserted. The door to his stateroom was closed. 
                At first I thought of knocking; then I remembered my ostensible 
                errand and resolved to carry it out. Carefully avoiding noise, 
                I lifted the trapdoor in the floor and set it to one side. The 
                slopchest, as well as the provisions, was stored in the lazaret, 
                and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay in a stock of underclothing. 
              </p>
              <p>　　As I emerged from the lazaret I heard sounds in Wolf Larsen's 
                stateroom. I crouched and listened. The doorknob rattled. Furtively, 
                instinctively, I slunk back behind the table, and drew and cocked 
                my revolver. The door swung open and he came forth. Never had 
                I seen so profound a despair as that which I saw on his face- 
                the face of Wolf Larsen the fighter, the strong man, the indomitable 
                one. For all the world like a woman wringing her hands, he raised 
                his clenched fists and groaned. One fist unclosed, and the open 
                palm swept across his eyes as though brushing away cobwebs. </p>
              <p>　　'God! God!' he groaned; and the clenched fists were raised 
                again to the infinite despair with which his throat vibrated. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was horrible. I was trembling all over, and I could feel 
                the shivers running up and down my spine and the sweat standing 
                out on my forehead. Surely there can be little in this world more 
                awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he 
                is utterly weak and broken. </p>
              <p>　　But Wolf Larsen regained control of himself by an exertion 
                of his remarkable will. And it was exertion. His whole frame shook 
                with the struggle. He resembled a man on the verge of a fit. His 
                face strove to compose itself, writhing and twisting in the effort 
                till he broke down again. Once more the clenched fists went upward 
                and he groaned. He caught his breath once or twice and sobbed. 
                Then he was successful. I could have thought him the old Wolf 
                Larsen, and yet there was in his movements a vague suggestion 
                of weakness and indecision. He started for the companionway, and 
                stepped forward quite as I had been accustomed to see him do; 
                and yet again, in his very walk, there seemed that suggestion 
                of weakness and indecision. </p>
              <p>　　I was now concerned with fear for myself. The open trap lay 
                directly in his path, and his discovery of it would lead instantly 
                to his discovery of me. I was angry with myself for being caught 
                in so cowardly a position, crouching on the floor. There was yet 
                time. I rose swiftly to my feet, and, I know, quite unconsciously 
                assumed a defiant attitude. He took no notice of me. Nor did he 
                notice the open trap. Before I could grasp the situation, or act, 
                he had walked right into the trap. One foot was descending into 
                the opening, while the other foot was just on the verge of beginning 
                the uplift. But when the descending foot missed the solid flooring 
                and felt vacancy beneath, it was the old Wolf Larsen and the tiger 
                muscles that made the falling body spring across the opening, 
                even as it fell, so that he struck on his chest and stomach, with 
                arms outstretched, on the floor of the opposite side. The next 
                instant he had drawn up his legs and rolled clear. But he rolled 
                into my marmalade and underclothes and against the trap-door. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The expression on his face was one of complete comprehension. 
                But before I could guess what he had comprehended, he had dropped 
                the trap-door into place, closing the lazaret. Then I understood. 
                He thought he had me inside. Also, he was blind- blind as a bat. 
                I watched him, breathing carefully so that he should not hear 
                me. He stepped quickly to his stateroom. I saw his hand miss the 
                doorknob by an inch, quickly fumble for it, and find it. This 
                was my chance. I tiptoed across the cabin and to the top of the 
                stairs. He came back, dragging a heavy sea-chest, which he deposited 
                on top of the trap. Not content with this, he fetched a second 
                chest and placed it on top of the first. Then he gathered up the 
                marmalade and underclothes and put them on the table. When he 
                started up the companionway, I retreated, silently rolling over 
                on top of the cabin. </p>
              <p>　　He shoved the slide part away back and rested his arms on it, 
                his body still in the companionway. His attitude was of one looking 
                forward the length of the schooner, or staring, rather, for his 
                eyes were fixed and unblinking. I was only five feet away and 
                directly in what should have been his line of vision. It was uncanny. 
                I felt myself a ghost, in my invisibility. I waved my hand back 
                and forth, of course without effect; but when the moving shadow 
                fell across his face I saw at once that he was susceptible to 
                the impression. His face became more expectant and tense as he 
                tried to analyze and identify the impression. He knew that he 
                had responded to something from without, that his sensibility 
                had been touched by a changing something in his environment; but 
                what it was he could not discover. I ceased waving my hand, so 
                that the shadow remained stationary. He slowly moved his head 
                back and forth under it and turned from side to side, now in the 
                sunshine, now in the shade, feeling the shadow, as it were, testing 
                it by sensation. </p>
              <p>　　I, too, was busy, trying to reason out how he was aware of 
                the existence of so intangible a thing as a shadow. If it were 
                his eyeballs only that were affected, or if his optic nerve were 
                not wholly destroyed, the explanation was simple. If otherwise, 
                then the only conclusion I could reach was that the sensitive 
                skin recognized the difference of temperature between shade and 
                sunshine. Or perhaps- and who could tell?- it was that fabled 
                sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an object 
                close at hand. </p>
              <p>　　Giving over his attempt to determine the shadow, he stepped 
                out on deck and started forward, walking with a swiftness and 
                confidence which surprised me. And still there was that hint of 
                the feebleness of the blind in his walk. I knew it now for what 
                it was. </p>
              <p>　　To my amused chagrin, he discovered my shoes on the forecastle-head 
                and brought them back with him into the galley. I watched him 
                build the fire and set about cooking food for himself; then I 
                stole into the cabin for my marmalade and underclothes, slipped 
                back past the galley, and climbed down to the beach to deliver 
                my barefoot report.</p>

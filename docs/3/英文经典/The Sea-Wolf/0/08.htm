            <td> 
              <p>　　SOMETIMES I THOUGHT Wolf Larsen mad, or half mad at least, 
                what with his strange moods and vagaries. At other times I took 
                him for a great man, a genius who had never arrived. And, finally, 
                I was convinced that he was the perfect type of the primitive 
                man, born a thousand years or generations too late, and an anachronism 
                in this culminating century of civilization. He was certainly 
                an individualist of the most pronounced type. Not only that, but 
                he was very lonely. There was no congeniality between him and 
                the rest of the men aboard ship; his tremendous virility and mental 
                strength walled him apart. They were more like children to him, 
                even the hunters, and as children he treated them, descending 
                perforce to their level and playing with them as a man plays with 
                puppies. Or else he probed them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, 
                groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls 
                as though to see of what this soul-stuff was made. </p>
              <p>　　I had seen him a score of times, at table, insulting this hunter 
                or that with cool and level eyes and, withal, a certain air of 
                interest, pondering their actions or replies or petty rages with 
                a curiosity almost laughable to me who stood onlooker and who 
                understood. Concerning his own rages, I was convinced that they 
                were not real, that they were sometimes experiments, but that 
                in the main they were the habits of a pose or attitude he had 
                seen fit to take toward his fellowmen. I knew, with the possible 
                exception of the incident of the dead mate, that I had not seen 
                him really angry; nor did I wish ever to see him in a genuine 
                rage, when all the force of him would be called into play. </p>
              <p>　　While on the question of vagaries, I shall tell what befell 
                Thomas Mugridge in the cabin, and at the same time complete an 
                incident upon which I have already touched once or twice. The 
                twelve o'clock dinner was over, one day, and I had just finished 
                putting the cabin in order, when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge 
                descended the companion-stairs. Though the cook had a cubby-hole 
                of a state-room opening off from the cabin, in the cabin itself 
                he had never dared to linger or to be seen, and he flitted to 
                and fro, once or twice a day, like a timid specter. </p>
              <p>　　'So you know how to play Nap,' Wolf Larsen was saying in a 
                pleased sort of voice. 'I might have guessed an Englishman would 
                know. I learned it myself in English ships.' </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge was beside himself, a blithering imbecile, 
                so pleased was he at chumming thus with the captain. The little 
                airs he put on, and the painful striving to assume the easy carriage 
                of a man born to a dignified place in life, would have been sickening 
                had they not been ludicrous. He quite ignored my presence, though 
                I credited him with being simply unable to see me. His pale, wishy-washy 
                eyes were swimming like lazy summer seas, though what blissful 
                visions they beheld were beyond my imagination. </p>
              <p>　　'Get the cards, Hump,' Wolf Larsen ordered, as they took seats 
                at the table, 'and bring out the cigars and the whiskey you'll 
                find in my berth.' </p>
              <p>　　I returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting 
                broadly that there was a mystery about him- that he might be a 
                gentleman's son gone wrong or something or other; also, that he 
                was a remittance-man, and was paid to keep away from- England- 
                'p'yed 'an'somely, sir,' was the way he put it; 'p'yed 'an'somely 
                to sling my 'ook an' keep slingin' it.' </p>
              <p>　　I had brought the customary liquor-glasses, but Wolf Larsen 
                frowned, shook his head, and signaled with his hands for me to 
                bring the tumblers. These he filled two thirds full with undiluted 
                whiskey,- 'a gentleman's drink,' quoth Thomas Mugridge,- and they 
                clinked their glasses to the glorious game of Nap, lighted cigars, 
                and fell to shuffling and dealing the cards. </p>
              <p>　　They played for money. They increased the amounts of the bets. 
                They drank whiskey, they drank it neat, and I fetched more. I 
                do not know whether Wolf Larsen cheated,- a thing he was thoroughly 
                capable of doing,- but he won steadily. The cook made repeated 
                journeys to his bunk for money. Each time he performed the journey 
                with greater swagger, but he never brought more than a few dollars 
                at a time. He grew maudlin, familiar, could hardly see the cards 
                or sit upright. As a preliminary to another journey to his bunk, 
                he hooked Wolf Larsen's buttonhole with a greasy forefinger and 
                vacuously proclaimed and reiterated: 'I got money. I got money, 
                I tell yer, an' I'm a gentleman's son.' </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen was unaffected by the drink, yet he drank glass 
                for glass, and, if anything, his glasses were fuller. There was 
                no change in him. He did not appear even amused at the other's 
                antics. </p>
              <p>　　In the end, with loud protestations that he could lose like 
                a gentleman, the cook's last money was staked on the game and 
                lost. Whereupon he leaned his head on his hands and wept. Wolf 
                Larsen looked curiously at him, as though about to probe and vivisect 
                him, then changed his mind, as from the foregone conclusion that 
                there was nothing there to probe. </p>
              <p>　　'Hump,' he said to me, elaborately polite, 'kindly take Mr. 
                Mugridge's arm and help him up on deck. He is not feeling very 
                well. And tell Johansen to douse him with a few buckets of salt 
                water,' he added in a lower tone, for my ear alone. </p>
              <p>　　I left Mr. Mugridge on deck, in the hands of a couple of grinning 
                sailors who had been told off for the purpose. Mr. Mugridge was 
                sleepily spluttering that he was a gentleman's son. But as I descended 
                the companion-stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as 
                the first bucket of water struck him. </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen was counting his winnings. </p>
              <p>　　'One hundred and eighty-five dollars, even,' he said aloud. 
                'Just as I thought. The beggar came aboard without a cent.' </p>
              <p>　　'And what you have won is mine, sir,' I said boldly. </p>
              <p>　　He favored me with a quizzical smile. 'Hump, I have studied 
                some grammar in my time, and I think your tenses are tangled. 
                &quot;Was mine,&quot; you should have said, not &quot;is mine.&quot;' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It is a question, not of grammar, but of ethics,' I answered. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was possibly a minute before he spoke. </p>
              <p>　　'D' ye know, Hump,' he said, with a slow seriousness which 
                had in it an indefinable strain of sadness, 'that this is the 
                first time I have heard the word &quot;ethics&quot; in the mouth 
                of a man. You and I are the only men on this ship who know its 
                meaning.' </p>
              <p>　　'At one time in my life,' he continued, after another pause, 
                'I dreamed that I might some day talk with men who used such language, 
                that I might lift myself out of the place in life in which I had 
                been born, and hold conversations and mingle with men who talked 
                about just such things as ethics. And this is the first time I 
                have ever heard the word pronounced. Which is all by the way, 
                for you are wrong. It is a question neither of grammar nor ethics, 
                but of fact.' </p>
              <p>　　'I understand,' I said. 'The fact is that you have the money.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　His face brightened. He seemed pleased at my perspicacity. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But it's avoiding the real question,' I continued, 'which 
                is one of right.' </p>
              <p>　　'Ah,' he remarked, with a wry pucker of his mouth, 'I see you 
                still believe in such things as right and wrong.' </p>
              <p>　　'But don't you- at all?' I demanded. </p>
              <p>　　'Not the least bit. Might is right, and that is all there is 
                to it. Weakness is wrong. Which is a very poor way of saying that 
                it is good for oneself to be strong, and evil for oneself to be 
                weak, or, better yet, it is pleasurable to be strong, because 
                of the profits; painful to be weak, because of the penalties. 
                just now the possession of this money is a pleasurable thing. 
                It is good for one to possess it. Being able to possess it, I 
                wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you and 
                forego the pleasure of possessing it.' </p>
              <p>　　'But you wrong me by withholding it,' I objected. </p>
              <p>　　'Not at all. One man cannot wrong another man. He can only 
                wrong himself. As I see it, I do wrong always when I consider 
                the interests of others. Don't you see? How can two particles 
                of the yeast wrong each other by striving to devour each other? 
                It is their inborn heritage to strive to devour, and to strive 
                not to be devoured. When they depart from this they sin.' </p>
              <p>　　'Then you don't believe in altruism?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　He received the word as though it had a familiar ring, though 
                he pondered it thoughtfully. 'Let me see; it means something about 
                cooperation, doesn't it?' </p>
              <p>　　Well, in a way there has come to be a sort of connection,' 
                I answered, unsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary, 
                which, like his knowledge, was the acquirement of a self-read, 
                self-educated man whom no one had directed in his studies, and 
                who had thought much and talked little or not at all. 'An altruistic 
                act is an act performed for the welfare of others. It is unselfish, 
                as opposed to an act performed for self, which is selfish.' </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head. 'Oh, yes, I remember it now. I ran across 
                it in Spencer.' </p>
              <p>　　'Spencer!' I cried. 'Have you read him?' </p>
              <p>　　'Not very much,' was his confession. 'I understood quite a 
                good deal of &quot;First Principles,&quot; but his &quot;Biology&quot; 
                took the wind out of my sails, and his &quot;Psychology&quot; 
                left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day. I honestly 
                could not understand what he was driving at. I put it down to 
                mental deficiency on my part, but since then I have decided that 
                it was for want of preparation. I had no proper basis. Only Spencer 
                and myself know how hard I hammered. But I did get something out 
                of his &quot;Data of Ethics.&quot; There's where I ran across 
                &quot;altruism,&quot; and I remember now how it was used.' </p>
              <p>　　I wondered what this man could have got from such a work. Spencer 
                I remembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his 
                ideal of highest conduct. Wolf Larsen evidently had sifted the 
                great philosopher's teachings, rejecting and selecting according 
                to his needs and desires. </p>
              <p>　　'What else did you run across?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　His brows drew in slightly with the mental effort of suitably 
                phrasing thoughts which he had never before put into speech. I 
                felt an elation of spirit. I was groping in his soul-stuff, as 
                he made a practice of groping in the soul-stuff of others. I was 
                exploring virgin territory. A strange, a terribly strange region 
                was unrolling itself before my eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'In as few words as possible,' he began, 'Spencer puts it something 
                like this: First, a man must act for his own benefit- to do this 
                is to be moral and good. Next, he must act for the benefit of 
                his children. And third, he must act for the benefit of his race.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'And the highest, finest right conduct,' I interjected, 'is 
                that act which benefits at the same time the man, his children, 
                and his race.' </p>
              <p>　　'I wouldn't stand for that,' he replied. 'Couldn't see the 
                necessity for it, nor the common sense. I cut out the race and 
                the children. I would sacrifice nothing for them. It's just so 
                much slush and sentiment, and you must see it yourself, at least 
                for one who does not believe in eternal life. With immortality 
                before me, altruism would be a paying business proposition. I 
                might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes. But with nothing 
                eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell this yeasty 
                crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be 
                immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice. Any sacrifice 
                that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish; and not only 
                foolish, for it is a wrong against myself, and a wicked thing. 
                I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out 
                of the ferment. Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming 
                to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses 
                of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.' </p>
              <p>　　'Then you are an individualist, a materialist, and, logically, 
                a hedonist.' </p>
              <p>　　'Big words,' he smiled. 'But what is a hedonist?' </p>
              <p>　　He nodded agreement when I had given the definition. </p>
              <p>　　'And you are also,' I continued, 'a man one could not trust 
                in the least thing where it was possible for a selfish interest 
                to intervene?' </p>
              <p>　　'Now you're beginning to understand,' he said, brightening. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'You are a man utterly without what the world calls morals?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'That's it.' </p>
              <p>　　'A man of whom to be always afraid-' </p>
              <p>　　'That's the way to put it.' </p>
              <p>　　'As one is afraid of a snake, or a tiger, or a shark?' </p>
              <p>　　'Now you know me,' he said. 'And you know me as I am generally 
                known. Other men call me &quot;Wolf.&quot;' </p>
              <p>　　'You are a sort of monster,' I added audaciously, 'a Caliban 
                who has pondered Setebos, and who acts as you act, in idle moments, 
                by whim and fancy.' </p>
              <p>　　His brow clouded at the allusion. He did not understand, and 
                I quickly learned that he did not know the poem. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm just reading Browning,' he confessed, 'and it's pretty 
                tough. I haven't got very far along, and as it is, I've about 
                lost my bearings.' </p>
              <p>　　Not to be tiresome, I shall say that I fetched the book from 
                his state-room and read 'Caliban' aloud. He was delighted. It 
                was a primitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that 
                he understood thoroughly. He interrupted again and again with 
                comment and criticism. When I finished, he had me read it over 
                a second time, and a third. We fell into discussion- philosophy, 
                science, evolution, religion. He betrayed the inaccuracies of 
                the self-read man, and, it must be granted, the certitude and 
                directness of the primitive mind. The very simplicity of his reasoning 
                was its strength, and his materialism was far more compelling 
                than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth. Not that 
                I, a confirmed, and, as Furuseth phrased it, a temperamental, 
                idealist, was to be compelled; but that Wolf Larsen stormed the 
                last strongholds of my faith with a vigor that received respect 
                while not accorded conviction. </p>
              <p>　　Time passed. Supper was at hand and the table not laid. I became 
                restless and anxious, and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the 
                companionway, sick and angry of countenance, I prepared to go 
                about my duties. But Wolf Larsen cried out to him': </p>
              <p>　　'Cooky, you've got to hustle tonight. I'm busy with Hump, and 
                you'll do the best you can without him.' </p>
              <p>　　And again the unprecedented was established. That night I sat 
                at table with the captain and the hunters, while Thomas Mugridge 
                waited on us and washed the dishes afterward- a whim, a Caliban-mood 
                of Wolf Larsen's, and one I foresaw would bring me trouble. In 
                the meantime we talked and talked, much to the disgust of the 
                hunters, who could not understand a word. </p>

              <p>　　THE NEXT DAY, WHILE THE STORM was blowing itself out, Wolf 
                Larsen and I 'crammed' anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge's 
                ribs. Then, when the storm broke, Wolf Larsen cruised back and 
                forth over that portion of the ocean where we had encountered 
                it, and somewhat more to the westward, while the boats were being 
                repaired and new sails made and bent. Also, a new galley was being 
                constructed out of odds and ends of lumber from the hold. Sealing-schooner 
                after sealing-schooner we sighted and boarded, most of which were 
                in search of lost boats, and most of which were carrying boats 
                and crews that they had picked up and that did not belong to them. 
                For the thick of the fleet had been to the westward of us, and 
                the boats, scattered far and wide, had headed in mad flight for 
                the nearest refuge. </p>
              <p>　　Two of our boats, with men all safe, we took off the Cisco, 
                and, to Wolf Larsen's huge delight and my own grief, he culled 
                Smoke, with Nilson and Leach, from the San Diego. So that, at 
                the end of five days, we found ourselves short but four men, Henderson, 
                Holyoak, Williams, and Kelly, and were once more hunting on the 
                flanks of the herd. </p>
              <p>　　As we followed north, we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs. 
                Day after day the boats were lowered and swallowed up almost before 
                they touched the water, while we on board pumped the horn at regular 
                intervals, and every fifteen minutes fired the bomb-gun. Boats 
                were continually being lost and found, it being the custom for 
                a boat to hunt, on lay, with whatever schooner picked it up, until 
                such time as it was recovered by its own schooner. But Wolf Larsen, 
                as was to be expected, being a boat short, took possession of 
                the first stray one and compelled its men to hunt with the Ghost, 
                not permitting them to return to their own schooner when we sighted 
                it. I remember how he forced the hunter and his two men below, 
                a rifle at their breasts, when their captain passed by at biscuit-toss 
                and hailed us for information. </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge, so strangely and pertinaciously clinging to 
                life, was soon limping about again and performing his double duties 
                of cook and cabin-boy. Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten 
                as much as ever, and they looked for their lives to end with the 
                end of the hunting season; while the rest of the crew lived the 
                lives of dogs and were worked like dogs by their pitiless master. 
                As for Wolf Larsen and me, we got along fairly well, though I 
                could not quite rid myself of the idea that right conduct for 
                me lay in killing him. He fascinated me immeasurably, and I feared 
                him immeasurably; and yet I could not imagine him lying prone 
                in death. There was an endurance, as of perpetual youth, about 
                him, which rose up and forbade the picture. I could see him only 
                as living always and dominating always, fighting and destroying, 
                himself surviving. </p>
              <p>　　One diversion of his, when we were in the midst of the herd 
                and the sea was too rough to lower the boats, was to lower with 
                two boat-pullers and a steerer and go out himself. He was a good 
                shot, too, and brought many a skin aboard under what the hunters 
                termed 'impossible hunting conditions.' It seemed the breath of 
                his nostrils, this carrying his life in his hands and struggling 
                for it against tremendous odds. </p>
              <p>　　I was learning more and more seamanship, and one clear day, 
                a thing we rarely encountered now, I had the satisfaction of running 
                and handling the Ghost and picking up the boats myself. Wolf Larsen 
                had been smitten with one of his headaches, and I stood at the 
                wheel from morning until evening, sailing across the ocean after 
                the last lee boat, and heaving to and picking it and the other 
                five up without command or suggestion from him. </p>
              <p>　　Gales we encountered now and again, for it was a raw and stormy 
                region, and, in the middle of June, a typhoon most memorable to 
                me, and most important because of the changes wrought through 
                it upon my future. We must have been caught nearly at the center 
                of this circular storm, and Wolf Larsen ran out of it and to the 
                southward, first under a double-reefed jib, and finally under 
                bare poles. Never had I imagined so great a sea. The seas previously 
                encountered were as ripples compared with these, which ran a half-mile 
                from crest to crest and which upreared, I am confident, above 
                our masthead. So great was it that Wolf Larsen himself did not 
                dare heave to, though he was being driven far to the southward 
                and out of the seal herd. </p>
              <p>　　We must have been well in the path of the transpacific steamships 
                when the typhoon moderated, and here, to the surprise of the hunters, 
                we found ourselves in the midst of seals- a second herd, or sort 
                of rear-guard, they declared, and a most unusual thing. But it 
                was 'Boats over!' the boom, boom of guns, and pitiful slaughter 
                through the long day. </p>
              <p>　　It was at this time that I was approached by Leach. I had just 
                finished tallying the skins of the last boat aboard when he came 
                to my side, in the darkness, and said in a low tone: </p>
              <p>　　'Can you tell me, Mr. Van Weyden, how far we are off the coast, 
                and what the bearings of Yokohama are?' </p>
              <p>　　My heart leaped with gladness, for I knew what he had in mind, 
                and I gave him the bearings- west-northwest and five hundred miles 
                away. </p>
              <p>　　'Thank you, sir,' was all he said as he slipped back into the 
                darkness. </p>
              <p>　　Next morning No. 3 boat and Johnson and Leach were missing. 
                The waterbreakers and grub-boxes from all the other boats were 
                likewise missing, as were the beds and sea-bags of the two men. 
                Wolf Larsen was furious. He set sail and bore away into the west-northwest, 
                two hunters constantly at the mastheads, and sweeping the sea 
                with glasses, himself pacing the deck like an angry lion. He knew 
                too well my sympathy for the runaways to send me aloft as lookout. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The wind was fair but fitful, and it was like looking for a 
                needle in a haystack to raise that tiny boat out of the blue immensity. 
                But he put the Ghost through her best paces, so as to get between 
                the deserters and the land. This accomplished, he cruised back 
                and forth across what he knew must be their course. </p>
              <p>　　On the morning of the third day, shortly after eight bells, 
                a cry that the boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead. 
                All hands lined the rail. A snappy breeze was blowing from the 
                west, with the promise of more wind behind it; and there, to leeward, 
                in the troubled silver of the rising sun, appeared and disappeared 
                a black speck. </p>
              <p>　　We squared away and ran for it. My heart was as lead. I felt 
                myself turning sick in anticipation; and as I looked at the gleam 
                of triumph in Wolf Larsen's eyes, his form swam before me, and 
                I felt almost irresistibly impelled to fling myself upon him. 
                So unnerved was I by the thought of impending violence to Leach 
                and Johnson that my reason must have left me. I know that I slipped 
                down into the steerage, in a daze, and that I was just beginning 
                the ascent to the deck, a loaded shotgun in my hands, when I heard 
                the startled cry: </p>
              <p>　　'There's five men in that boat!' </p>
              <p>　　I supported myself in the companion-way, weak and trembling, 
                while the observation was being verified by the remarks of the 
                rest of the men. Then my knees gave from under me, and I sank 
                down, myself again, but overcome by shock at knowledge of what 
                I had so nearly done. Also, I was very thankful as I put the gun 
                away and slipped back on deck. </p>
              <p>　　No one had remarked my absence. The boat was near enough for 
                us to make out that it was larger than any sealing-boat and built 
                on different lines. As we drew closer, the sail was taken in and 
                the mast unstepped. Oars were shipped, and its occupants waited 
                for us to heave to and take them aboard. </p>
              <p>　　Smoke, who had descended to the deck and was now standing by 
                my side, began to chuckle in a significant way. I looked at him 
                inquiringly. </p>
              <p>　　'Talk of a mess!' he giggled. 'It's a pretty one we've got 
                now.' </p>
              <p>　　'What's wrong?' I demanded. </p>
              <p>　　Again he chuckled. 'Don't you see there, in the stern- sheets, 
                on the bottom? May I never shoot a seal again if that ain't a 
                woman!' </p>
              <p>　　I looked closely, but was not sure until exclamation broke 
                out on all sides. The boat contained four men, and its fifth occupant 
                was certainly a woman. </p>
              <p>　　We were agog with excitement, all except Wolf Larsen, who was 
                too evidently disappointed in that it was not his own boat with 
                the two victims of his malice. </p>
              <p>　　We ran down the flying jib, hauled the jib-sheets to windward 
                and the mainsheet flat, and came up into the wind. The oars struck 
                the water, and with a few strokes the boat was alongside. I now 
                caught my first fair glimpse of the woman. She was wrapped in 
                a long ulster, for the morning was raw, and I could see nothing 
                but her face and a mass of light-brown hair escaping from under 
                the seaman's cap on her head. The eyes were large and brown and 
                lustrous, the mouth sweet and sensitive, and the face itself a 
                delicate oval, though sun and exposure to briny wind had burned 
                the face scarlet. </p>
              <p>　　She seemed to me like a being from another world. I was aware 
                of a hungry outreaching for her, as of a starving man for bread. 
                But then I had not seen a woman for a very long time. I know that 
                I was lost in a great wonder, almost a stupor,- this, then, was 
                a woman?- so that I forgot myself and my mate's duties, and took 
                no part in helping the newcomers aboard. For when one of the sailors 
                lifted her into Wolf Larsen's down-stretched arms, she looked 
                up into our curious faces and smiled amusedly and sweetly, as 
                only a woman can smile, and as I had seen no one smile for so 
                long that I had forgotten such smiles existed. </p>
              <p>　　'Mr. Van Weyden!' </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen's voice brought me sharply back to myself. </p>
              <p>　　'Will you take the lady below and see to her comfort? Make 
                up that spare port cabin. Put Cooky to work on it. And see what 
                you can do for that face. It's burned badly.' </p>
              <p>　　He turned brusquely away from us and began to question the 
                new men. The boat was cast adrift, though one of them called it 
                a 'bloody shame,' with Yokohama so near. </p>
              <p>　　I found myself strangely afraid of this woman I was escorting 
                aft. Also, I was awkward. It seemed to me that I was realizing 
                for the first time what a delicate, fragile creature a woman is, 
                and as I caught her arm to help her down the companion-stairs, 
                I was startled by its smallness and softness. Indeed, she was 
                a slender, delicate woman, as women go, but to me she was so ethereally 
                slender and delicate that I was quite prepared for her arm to 
                crumble in my grasp. All this in frankness, to show my first impression, 
                after long deprivation, of women in general and of Maud Brewster 
                in particular. </p>
              <p>　　'No need to go to any great trouble for me,' she protested, 
                when I had seated her in Wolf Larsen's armchair, which I had dragged 
                hastily from his cabin. 'The men were looking for land at any 
                moment this morning, and the vessel should be in by night, don't 
                you think so?' </p>
              <p>　　Her simple faith in the immediate future took me aback. How 
                could I explain to her the situation, the strange man who stalked 
                the sea like Destiny, all that it had taken me months to learn? 
                But I answered honestly: </p>
              <p>　　'If it were any other captain except ours, I should say you 
                would be ashore in Yokohama tomorrow. But our captain is a strange 
                man, and I beg of you to be prepared for anything- understand?- 
                for anything.' </p>
              <p>　　'I- I confess I hardly do understand,' she hesitated, a perturbed 
                but not frightened expression in her eyes. 'Or is it a misconception 
                of mine that shipwrecked people are always shown every consideration? 
                This is such a little thing, you know, we are so close to land.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Candidly, I do not know,' I strove to reassure her. 'I wished 
                merely to prepare you for the worst, if the worst is to come. 
                This man, this captain, is a brute, a demon, and one can never 
                tell what will be his next fantastic act.' </p>
              <p>　　I was growing excited, but she interrupted me with an 'Oh, 
                I see,' and her voice sounded weary. To think was patently an 
                effort. She was clearly on the verge of physical collapse. </p>
              <p>　　She asked no further questions, and I vouchsafed no remarks, 
                devoting myself to Wolf Larsen's command, which was to make her 
                comfortable. I bustled about in quite housewifely fashion, procuring 
                soothing lotions for her sunburn, raiding Wolf Larsen's private 
                stores for a bottle of port I knew to be there, and directing 
                Thomas Mugridge in the preparation of the spare state-room. </p>
              <p>　　The wind was freshening rapidly, the Ghost heeling over more 
                and more, and by the time the state-room was ready she was dashing 
                through the water at a lively clip. I had quite forgotten the 
                existence of Leach and Johnson, when suddenly, like a thunder-clap, 
                'Boat ho!' came down the open companionway. It was Smoke's unmistakable 
                voice, crying from the masthead. I shot a glance at the woman, 
                but she was leaning back in the armchair, her eyes closed, unutterably 
                tired. I doubted that she had heard, and I resolved to prevent 
                her seeing the brutality I knew would follow the capture of the 
                deserters. She was tired. Very good. She should sleep. </p>
              <p>　　There were swift commands on deck, a stamping of feet and a 
                slapping of reefpoints, as the Ghost shot into the wind and about 
                on the other tack. As she filled away and heeled, the armchair 
                began to slide across the cabin floor, and I sprang for it just 
                in time to prevent the rescued woman from being spilled out. </p>
              <p>　　Her eyes were too heavy to suggest more than a hint of the 
                sleepy surprise that perplexed her as she looked up at me, and 
                she half stumbled, half tottered as I led her to her cabin. Mugridge 
                grinned insinuatingly in my face as I shoved him out and ordered 
                him back to his galley work, and he won his revenge by spreading

                blankets, her head resting on a pillow I had appropriated from 
                Wolf Larsen's bunk.</p>

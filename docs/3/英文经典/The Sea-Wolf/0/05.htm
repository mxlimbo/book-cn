              <p>　　BUT MY FIRST NIGHT IN the hunters' steerage was also my last. 
                Next day Johansen, the new mate, was routed from the cabin by 
                Wolf Larsen and sent into the steerage to sleep thereafter, while 
                I took possession of the tiny cabin state-room, which, on the 
                first day of the voyage, had already had two occupants. The reason 
                for this change was quickly learned by the hunters and became 
                the cause of a deal of grumbling on their part. It seemed that 
                Johansen, in his sleep, lived over each night the events of the 
                day. His incessant talking and shouting and bellowing of orders 
                had been too much for Wolf Larsen, who accordingly foisted the 
                nuisance upon his hunters. </p>
              <p>　　After a sleepless night, I arose, weak and in agony, to hobble 
                through my second day on the Ghost. Thomas Mugridge routed me 
                out at half-past five, much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must 
                have routed out his dog. But Mr. Mugridge's brutality to me was 
                paid back in kind and with interest. The unnecessary noise he 
                made (I had lain wide-eyed the whole night) must have awakened 
                one of the hunters; for a heavy shoe whizzed through the semidarkness, 
                and Mr. Mugridge, with a sharp howl of pain, humbly begged everybody's 
                pardon. Later on, in the galley, I noticed that his ear was bruised 
                and swollen. It never went entirely back to its normal shape, 
                and was called a 'cauliflower ear' by the sailors. </p>
              <p>　　The day was filled with miserable variety. I had taken my dried 
                clothes down from the galley the night before, and the first thing 
                I did was to exchange the cook's garments for them. I looked for 
                my purse. In addition to some small change (and I have a good 
                memory for such things), it had contained one hundred and eighty-five 
                dollars in gold and paper. The purse I found, but its contents, 
                with the exception of the small silver, had been abstracted. I 
                spoke to the cook about it, when I went on deck to take up my 
                duties in the galley; and though I had looked forward to a surly 
                answer, I had not expected the belligerent harangue that I received. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Look 'ere, 'Ump', he began, a malicious light in his eyes 
                and a snarl in his throat, 'd' ye want yer nose punched? If yer 
                think I'm a thief, just keep it to yerself, or you'll find 'ow 
                bloody well mistyken you are. Strike me blind if this ayn't gratitude 
                for yer! 'Ere yer come, a pore mis'rable specimen of 'uman scum, 
                an' I tykes yer into my galley an' treats yer 'andsome, an' this 
                is wot I get for it. Nex' time yer can go to 'ell, say I, an' 
                I've a good mind to give yer what-for, anyw'y.' </p>
              <p>　　So saying, he put up his fists and started for me. To my eternal 
                shame be it, I cowered away from the blow and ran out the galley 
                door. What else was I to do? Force, nothing but force, obtained 
                on this brute-ship. Moral suasion was a thing unknown. Picture 
                it to yourself: a man of ordinary stature, slender of build and 
                with weak, undeveloped muscles, who has lived a peaceful, placid 
                life, and is unused to violence of any sort- what could such a 
                man possibly do? There was no more reason that I should stand 
                and face these human beasts than that I should stand and face 
                an infuriated bull. </p>
              <p>　　So I thought it out at the time, feeling the need for vindication, 
                and desiring to be at peace with my conscience. But this vindication 
                did not satisfy. Nor to this day can I permit my manhood to look 
                back upon those events and feel entirely exonerated. The situation 
                was something that really exceeded rational formulas for conduct, 
                and demanded more than the cold conclusions of reason. When viewed 
                in the light of formal logic, there is not one thing of which 
                to be ashamed, but, nevertheless, a shame rises within me at the 
                recollection, and in the pride of my manhood I feel that my manhood 
                has in unaccountable ways been smirched and sullied. </p>
              <p>　　All of which is neither here nor there. The speed with which 
                I ran from the galley caused excruciating pain in my knee, and 
                I sank down helplessly at the break of the poop. But the Cockney 
                had not pursued me. </p>
              <p>　　'Look at 'im run! Look at 'im run!' I could hear him crying. 
                'An' with a gyme leg at that! Come on back, you pore little mama's 
                darlin'! I won't 'it her; no, I won't.' </p>
              <p>　　I came back and went on with my work, and here the episode 
                ended for the time, though further developments were yet to take 
                place. I set the breakfast table in the cabin, and at seven o'clock 
                waited on the hunters and officers. The storm had evidently broken 
                during the night, though a huge sea was still running and a stiff 
                wind blowing. Sail had been made in the early watches, so that 
                the Ghost was racing along under everything except the two topsails 
                and the flying jib. These three sails, I gathered from the conversation, 
                were to be set immediately after breakfast. I learned, also, that 
                Wolf Larsen was anxious to make the most of the storm, which was 
                driving him to the southwest, into that portion of the sea where 
                he expected to pick up with the northeast trades. It was before 
                this steady wind that he hoped to make the major portion of the 
                run to Japan, curving south into the tropics and north again as 
                he approached the coast of Asia. </p>
              <p>　　After breakfast I had another unenviable experience. When I 
                had finished washing the dishes, I cleaned the cabin stove and 
                carried the ashes up on deck to empty them. Wolf Larsen and Henderson 
                were standing near the wheel, deep in conversation. The sailor 
                Johnson was steering. As I started toward the weather side, I 
                saw him make a sudden motion with his head, which I mistook for 
                a token of recognition and good morning. In reality he was attempting 
                to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee side. Unconscious of 
                my blunder, I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter, and flung 
                the ashes over the side to windward. The wind drove them back, 
                and not only over me, but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen. The 
                next instant the latter kicked me violently, as a cur is kicked. 
                I had not realized there could be so much pain in a kick. I reeled 
                away from him and leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting 
                condition. Everything was swimming before my eyes, and I turned 
                sick. The nausea overpowered me, and I managed to crawl to the 
                side in time to save the deck. But Wolf Larsen did not follow 
                me up. Brushing the ashes from his clothes, he had resumed his 
                conversation with Henderson. Johansen, who had seen the affair 
                from the break of the poop, sent a couple of sailors aft to clean 
                up the mess. </p>
              <p>　　Later in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different 
                sort. Following the cook's instructions, I had gone into Wolf 
                Larsen's state-room to put it to rights and make the bed. Against 
                the wall, near the head of the bunk, was a rack filled with books. 
                I glanced over them, noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare, 
                Tennyson, Poe, and De Quincey. There were scientific works, too, 
                among which were represented men such as Tyndall, Proctor, Darwin, 
                and I remarked Bulfinch's 'Age of Fable,' Shaw's 'History of English 
                and American Literature,' and Johnson's 'Natural History' in two 
                large volumes. Then there were a number of grammars, such as Metcalf 
                and Reed &amp; Kellogg; and I smiled as I saw a copy of 'The Dean's 
                English.' </p>
              <p>　　I could not reconcile these books with the man from what I 
                had seen of him, and I wondered if he could possibly read them. 
                But when I came to make the bed, I found, between the blankets, 
                dropped apparently as he had sunk off to sleep, a complete Browning. 
                It was open at 'In a Balcony,' and I noticed here and there passages 
                underlined in pencil. Further, letting drop the volume during 
                a lurch of the ship, a sheet of paper fell out. It was scrawled 
                over with geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was patent that this terrible man was no ignorant clod, 
                such as one would inevitably suppose him to be from his exhibitions 
                of brutality. At once he became an enigma. One side or the other 
                of his nature was perfectly comprehensible, but both sides together 
                were bewildering. I had already remarked that his language was 
                excellent, marred with an occasional slight inaccuracy. Of course, 
                in common speech with the sailors and hunters, it sometimes fairly 
                bristled with errors, which was due to the vernacular itself; 
                but in the few words he had held with me it had been clear and 
                correct. </p>
              <p>　　This glimpse I had caught of his other side must have emboldened 
                me, for I resolved to speak to him about the money I had lost. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I have been robbed,' I said to him a little later, when I 
                found him pacing up and down the poop alone. </p>
              <p>　　'Sir,' he corrected, not harshly, but sternly. </p>
              <p>　　'I have been robbed, sir,' I amended. </p>
              <p>　　'How did it happen?' he asked. </p>
              <p>　　Then I told him the whole circumstance: how my clothes had 
                been left to dry in the galley, and how, later, I was nearly beaten 
                by the cook when I mentioned the matter. </p>
              <p>　　He smiled at my recital. </p>
              <p>　　'Pickings,' he concluded; 'Cooky's pickings. And don't you 
                think your miserable life worth the price? Besides, consider it 
                a lesson. You'll learn in time how to take care of your money 
                for yourself. I suppose, up to now, your lawyer has done it for 
                you, or your business agent.' </p>
              <p>　　I could feel the quiet sneer through his words, but demanded, 
                'How can I get it back again?' </p>
              <p>　　'That's your lookout. You haven't any lawyer or business agent 
                now, so you'll have to depend on yourself. When you get a dollar, 
                hang on to it. A man who leaves his money lying around the way 
                you did deserves to lose it. Besides, you have sinned. You have 
                no right to put temptation in the way of your fellow-creatures. 
                You tempted Cooky, and he fell. You have placed his immortal soul 
                in jeopardy. By the way, do you believe in the immortal soul?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed 
                that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his 
                soul. But it was an illusion. Far as it might have seemed, no 
                man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul, or seen it 
                at all; of this I am convinced. It was a very lonely soul, I was 
                to learn, that never unmasked, though at rare moments it played 
                at doing so. </p>
              <p>　　'I read immortality in your eyes,' I answered, dropping the 
                'sir'- an experiment, for I thought the intimacy of the conversation 
                warranted it. </p>
              <p>　　He took no notice. 'By that, I take it, you see something that 
                is alive, but that necessarily does not have to live forever.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I read more than that,' I continued boldly. </p>
              <p>　　'Then you read consciousness. You read the consciousness of 
                life that it is alive; but still, no further away, no endlessness 
                of life.' </p>
              <p>　　How clearly he thought, and how well he expressed what he thought! 
                From regarding me curiously, he turned his head and glanced out 
                over the leaden sea to windward. A bleakness came into his eyes, 
                and the lines of his mouth grew severe and harsh. He was evidently 
                in a pessimistic mood. </p>
              <p>　　'Then, to what end?' he demanded abruptly, turning back to 
                me. 'If I am immortal, why?' </p>
              <p>　　I halted. How could I explain my idealism to this man? How 
                could I put into speech a something felt, a something like the 
                strains of music heard in sleep, a something that convinced, yet 
                transcended utterance? </p>
              <p>　　'What do you believe, then?' I countered. </p>
              <p>　　'I believe that life is a mess,' he answered promptly. 'It 
                is like yeast, a ferment, a thing that moves, and may move for 
                a minute, an hour, a year, or a hundred years, but that in the 
                end will cease to move. The big eat the little that they may continue 
                to move; the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength. 
                The lucky eat the most and move the longest, that is all. What 
                do you make of those things?' </p>
              <p>　　He swept his arm in an impatient gesture toward a number of 
                the sailors who were working on some kind of rope-stuff amidships. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'They move. So does the jellyfish move. They move in order 
                to eat in order that they may keep moving. There you have it. 
                They live for their belly's sake, and the belly is for their sake. 
                It's a circle; you get nowhere. Neither do they. In the end they 
                come to a standstill. They move no more. They are dead.' </p>
              <p>　　'They have dreams,' I interrupted; 'radiant, flashing dreams- 
                ' </p>
              <p>　　'Of grub,' he concluded sententiously. </p>
              <p>　　'And of more- ' </p>
              <p>　　'Grub. Of a larger appetite and more luck in satisfying it.' 
                His voice sounded harsh. There was no levity in it. 'For, look 
                you, they dream of making lucky voyages which will bring them 
                more money, of becoming the masters of ships, of finding fortunes- 
                in short, of being in a better position for preying on their fellows, 
                of having all night in, good grub, and somebody else to do the 
                dirty work. You and I are just like them. There is no difference, 
                except that we have eaten more and better. I am eating them now, 
                and you, too. But in the past you have eaten more than I have. 
                You have slept in soft beds, and worn fine clothes, and eaten 
                good meals. Who made those beds, and those clothes, and those 
                meals? Not you. You never made anything in your own sweat. You 
                live on an income which your father earned. You are like a frigate-bird 
                swooping down upon the boobies and robbing them of the fish they 
                have caught. You are one with a crowd of men who have made what 
                they call a government, who are masters of all the other men, 
                and who eat the food the other men get and would like to eat themselves. 
                You wear the warm clothes. They made the clothes, but they shiver 
                in rags and ask you, or the lawyer or business agent who handles 
                your money, for a job.' </p>
              <p>　　'But that is beside the matter,' I cried. </p>
              <p>　　'Not at all.' He was speaking rapidly now, and his eyes were 
                flashing. 'It is piggishness, and it is life. Of what use or sense 
                is an immortality of piggishness? What is the end? What is it 
                all about? You have made no food, yet the food you have eaten 
                or wasted might have saved the lives of a score of wretches who 
                made the food, but did not eat it. What immortal end did you serve? 
                Or did they? Consider yourself and me. What does your boasted 
                immortality amount to when your life runs foul of mine? You would 
                like to go back to the land, which is a favorable place for your 
                kind of piggishness. It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this 
                ship, where my piggishness flourishes. And keep you I will. I 
                may make or break you. You may die today, this week, or next month. 
                I could kill you now, with a blow of my fist, for you are a miserable 
                weakling. But if we are immortal, what is the reason for this? 
                To be piggish as you and I have been all our lives does not seem 
                to be just the thing for immortals to be doing. Again, what's 
                it all about? Why have I kept you here?' </p>
              <p>　　'Because you are stronger,' I managed to blurt out. </p>
              <p>　　'But why stronger?' he went on at once with his perpetual queries. 
                'Because I am a bigger bit of the ferment than you. Don't you 
                see? Don't you see?' </p>
              <p>　　'But the hopelessness of it,' I protested. </p>
              <p>　　'I agree with you,' he answered. 'Then why move at all, since 
                moving is living? Without moving and being part of the yeast there 
                would be no hopelessness. But- and there it is- we want to live 
                and move, though we have no reason to, because it happens that 
                it is the nature of life to live and move, to want to live and 
                move. If it were not for this, life would be dead. It is because 
                of this life that is in you that you dream of your immortality. 
                The life that is in you is alive and wants to go on being alive 
                forever. Bah! An eternity of piggishness!' </p>
              <p>　　He abruptly turned on his heel and started forward. He stopped 
                at the break of the poop and called me to him. </p>
              <p>　　'By the way, how much was it that Cooky got away with?' he 
                asked. </p>
              <p>　　'One hundred and eighty-five dollars, sir,' I answered. </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head. A moment later, as I started down the companion-stairs 
                to lay the table for dinner, I heard him loudly cursing some man 
                amidships.</p>

              <p>　　AT ONCE WE MOVED ABOARD the Ghost, occupying our old staterooms 
                and cooking in the galley. The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had 
                happened most opportunely, for what must have been the Indian 
                summer of this high latitude was gone, and drizzling, stormy weather 
                had set in. We were very comfortable; and the inadequate shears, 
                with the foremast suspended from them, gave a businesslike air 
                to the schooner and a promise of departure. </p>
              <p>　　And now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons, how little did we 
                need it! Like his first attack, his second had been accompanied 
                by serious disablement. Maud made the discovery in the afternoon, 
                while trying to give him nourishment. He had shown signs of consciousness, 
                and she had spoken to him, eliciting no response. He was lying 
                on his left side at the time, and in evident pain. With a restless 
                movement he rolled his head around, clearing his left ear from 
                the pillow against which it had been pressed. At once he heard 
                and answered her, and at once she came to me. </p>
              <p>　　Pressing the pillow against his left ear, I asked him if he 
                heard me, but he gave no sign. Removing the pillow and repeating 
                the question, I was answered promptly that he did. </p>
              <p>　　'Do you know you are deaf in the right ear?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes,' he answered in a low, strong voice, 'and worse than 
                that. My whole right side is affected. It seems asleep. I cannot 
                move arm or leg.' </p>
              <p>　　'Feigning again?' I demanded angrily. </p>
              <p>　　He shook his head, his stern mouth shaping a strange, twisted 
                smile. It was indeed a twisted smile, for it was on the left side 
                only, the facial muscles of the right side moving not at all. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'That was the last stroke of the Wolf,' he said. 'I am paralyzed; 
                I shall never walk again. Oh, only on the right side,' he added, 
                as though divining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg, 
                the knee of which had just then drawn up and elevated the blankets. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It's unfortunate,' he continued. 'I'd like to have done for 
                you first, Hump. And I thought I had that much left in me.' </p>
              <p>　　'But why?' I asked, partly in horror, partly out of curiosity. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Again his mouth framed the twisted smile, as he said: </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, just to be alive, to be living and doing, to be the biggest 
                big of the ferment to the end- to eat you. But to die this way-' 
              </p>
              <p>　　He shrugged his shoulders, or attempted to shrug them, rather, 
                for the left shoulder alone moved. Like the smile, the shrug was 
                twisted. </p>
              <p>　　'But how can you account for it?' I asked. 'Where is the seat 
                of trouble?' </p>
              <p>　　'The brain,' he said at once. 'It was those cursed headaches 
                brought it on.' </p>
              <p>　　'Symptoms,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head. 'There is no accounting for it. I was never 
                sick in my life. Something's gone wrong with my brain. A cancer 
                or tumor or something of that nature- a thing that devours and 
                destroys. It's attacking my nerve centers, eating them up, bit 
                by bit, cell by cell- from the pain.' </p>
              <p>　　'The motor centers, too,' I suggested. </p>
              <p>　　'So it would seem. And the curse of it is that I must lie here, 
                conscious, mentally unimpaired, knowing that the lines are going 
                down, breaking bit by bit communication with the world. I cannot 
                see; hearing and feeling are leaving me: at this rate I shall 
                soon cease to speak. Yet all the time I shall be here, alive, 
                active, and powerless.' </p>
              <p>　　'When you say you are here, I'd suggest the likelihood of the 
                soul,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Bosh!' was his retort. 'It simply means that in the attack 
                on my brain the higher psychical centers are untouched. I can 
                remember, think, and reason. When that goes, I go. I am not. The 
                soul?' </p>
              <p>　　He broke out in mocking laughter, then turned his left ear 
                to the pillow as a sign that he wished no further conversation. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Maud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate 
                which had overtaken him- how fearful we were yet fully to realize. 
                There was the awfulness of retribution about it. Our thoughts 
                were deep and solemn, and we spoke to each other scarcely above 
                whispers. </p>
              <p>　　'You might remove the handcuffs,' he said that night, as we 
                stood in consultation over him. 'It's dead safe. I'm a paralytic 
                now. The next thing to watch out for is bedsores.' </p>
              <p>　　He smiled his twisted smile, and Maud, her eyes wide with horror, 
                was compelled to turn away her head. </p>
              <p>　　'Do you know that your smile is crooked?' I asked him; for 
                I knew that she must attend him, and I wished to save her as much 
                as possible. </p>
              <p>　　'Then I shall smile no more,' he said calmly. 'I thought something 
                was wrong. My right cheek has been numb all day. Yes, and I've 
                had warnings of this for the last three days, by spells: my right 
                side seemed going to sleep, sometimes arm or hand, sometimes leg 
                or foot. </p>
              <p>　　'So my smile is crooked?' he queried, a short while after. 
                'Well, consider henceforth that I smile internally with my soul, 
                if you please- my soul. Consider that I am smiling now.' </p>
              <p>　　And for the space of several minutes he lay there, quiet, indulging 
                his grotesque fancy. </p>
              <p>　　The man of him was not changed. It was the old, indomitable, 
                terrible Wolf Larsen imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which 
                had once been so invincible and splendid. Now it bound him with 
                insentient fetters, walling his soul in darkness and silence, 
                blocking it from the world which to him had been a riot of action. 
                No more would he 'conjugate the verb to do in every mood and tense.' 
                'To be' was all that remained to him- to be, as he had defined 
                death, without movement; to will, but not to execute; to think 
                and reason, and in his spirit to be as alive as ever, but in the 
                flesh to be dead, quite dead. </p>
              <p>　　And yet, though I even removed the handcuffs, we could not 
                adjust ourselves to his condition. Our minds revolted. To us he 
                was full of potentiality. We knew not to expect of him next, what 
                fearful thing, rising above the flesh, he might break out and 
                do. Our experience warranted this state of mind, and we went about 
                with anxiety always upon us. </p>
              <p>　　I had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness 
                of the shears. By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new 
                one) I heaved the butt of the foremast across the rail and then 
                lowered it to the deck. Next, by means of the shears, I hoisted 
                the main-boom on board. Its forty feet of length would supply 
                the height necessary properly to swing the mast. By means of a 
                secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I swung the boom 
                to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt to the 
                deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around 
                it. The single block of my original shears- tackle I had attached 
                to the end of the boom. Thus by carrying this tackle to the windlass 
                I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt 
                always remaining stationary, and by means of guys I could swing 
                the boom from side to side. To the end of the boom I had likewise 
                rigged a hoisting-tackle, and when the whole arrangement was complete 
                I could not but be startled by the power and latitude it gave 
                me. </p>
              <p>　　Of course two days' work was required for the accomplishment 
                of this part of my task, and it was not till the morning of the 
                third day that I swung the foremast from the deck and proceeded 
                to square its butt to fit the step. Here I was especially awkward. 
                I sawed and chopped and chiseled the weathered wood till it had 
                the appearance of having been gnawed by some gigantic mouse. But 
                it fitted. </p>
              <p>　　'It will work- I know it will work!' I cried. </p>
              <p>　　Wolf Larsen had received another stroke. He had lost his voice, 
                or was losing it. He had only intermittent use of it. As he phrased 
                it, the wires were like the stock market, now up, now down. Occasionally 
                the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly 
                and heavily. Then speech would suddenly desert him, in the middle 
                of a sentence perhaps, and for hours, sometimes we would wait 
                for the connection to be reestablished. He complained of great 
                pain in his head, and it was during this period that he arranged 
                a system of communication against the time when speech should 
                leave him altogether- one pressure of the hand for 'yes,' two 
                for 'no.' It was well that it was arranged, for by evening his 
                voice had gone from him. By hand pressures, after that, he answered 
                our questions, and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts 
                with his left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper. </p>
              <p>　　The fierce winter had now descended upon us. Gale followed 
                gale, with snow and sleet and rain. The seals had started on their 
                great southern migration, and the rookery was virtually deserted. 
                I worked feverishly. In spite of the bad weather, and of the wind 
                which especially hindered me, I was on deck from daylight till 
                dark, and making substantial progress. </p>
              <p>　　I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears, 
                and then climbed them to attach the guys. To the top of the foremast, 
                which was lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, 
                stays, and throat-and peak-halyards. As usual, I had underrated 
                the amount of work involved in this portion of the task, and two 
                long days were necessary to complete it. And there was so much 
                yet to be done: the sails, for instance, had to be made over. 
              </p>
              <p>　　While I toiled at rigging the foremast, Maud sewed on the canvas, 
                ready always to drop everything and come to my assistance when 
                more hands than two were required. The canvas was heavy and hard, 
                and she sewed with the regular sailor's palm and the three-cornered 
                sail-needle. Her hands were soon sadly blistered, but she struggled 
                bravely on, and, in addition, did the cooking and took care of 
                the sick man. </p>
              <p>　　'A fig for superstition,' I said on Friday morning. 'That mast 
                goes in today.' </p>
              <p>　　Everything was ready for the attempt. Carrying the boom-tackle 
                to the windlass, I hoisted the mast nearly clear of the deck. 
                Making this tackle fast, I took to the windlass the shears-tackle 
                (which was connected with the end of the boom), and with a few 
                turns had the mast perpendicular and clear. </p>
              <p>　　Maud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding 
                the turn, crying: </p>
              <p>　　'It works! It works! We'll trust our lives to it!' </p>
              <p>　　Then she assumed a rueful expression. </p>
              <p>　　'It's not over the hole,' she said. 'Will you have to begin 
                all over?' </p>
              <p>　　I smiled in superior fashion, and, slacking off on one of the 
                boom-guys and taking in on the other, swung the mast perfectly 
                in the center of the deck. Still it was not over the hole. Again 
                the rueful expression came on her face, and again I smiled in 
                a superior way. Slacking away on the boom-tackle and hoisting 
                an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle, I brought the butt 
                of the mast into position directly over the hole in the deck. 
                Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away, and went 
                into the hold to the step on the schooner's bottom. </p>
              <p>　　I called to her, and the mast moved easily and accurately. 
                Straight toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended; 
                but as it descended it slowly twisted, so that square would not 
                fit into square. But I had not even a moment's indecision. Calling 
                to Maud to cease lowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle 
                fast to the mast with a rolling hitch. I left Maud to pull on 
                it while I went below. By the light of the lantern I saw the butt 
                twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of 
                the step. Maud made fast and returned to the windlass. Slowly 
                the butt descended the several intervening inches, at the same 
                time slightly twisting again. Once more Maud rectified the twist 
                with the watch-tackle, and once more she lowered away from the 
                windlass. Square fitted into square. The mast was stepped. </p>
              <p>　　I raised a shout, and she ran down to see. In the yellow lantern-light 
                we peered at what we had accomplished. We looked at each other, 
                and our hands felt their way and clasped. The eyes of both of 
                us, I think, were moist with the joy of success. </p>
              <p>　　'It was done so easily, after all,' I remarked. 'All the work 
                was in the preparation.' </p>
              <p>　　'And all the wonder in the completion,' Maud added. 'I can 
                scarcely bring myself to realize that that great mast is really 
                up and in- that you have lifted it from the water, swung it through 
                the air, and deposited it here where it belongs. It is a Titan's 
                task.' </p>
              <p>　　'And they made themselves many inventions-' I began merrily, 
                then paused to sniff the air. </p>
              <p>　　I looked hastily at the lantern. It was not smoking. Again 
                I sniffed. </p>
              <p>　　'Something is burning,' Maud said with sudden conviction. </p>
              <p>　　We sprang together for the ladder, but I raced past her to 
                the deck. A dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage 
                companionway. </p>
              <p>　　'The Wolf is not yet dead,' I muttered to myself as I sprang 
                down through the smoke. </p>
              <p>　　It was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled 
                to feel my way; and, so potent was the spell of Wolf Larsen on 
                my imagination, I was quite prepared for the helpless giant to 
                grip my neck in a stranglehold. I hesitated, the desire to race 
                back and up the steps to the deck almost overpowering me. Then 
                I recollected Maud. The vision of her, as I had last seen her, 
                in the lantern-light of the schooner's hold, her brown eyes warm 
                and moist with joy, flashed before me, and I knew that I could 
                not go back. </p>
              <p>　　I was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen's 
                bunk. I reached in my hand and felt for him. He was lying motionless, 
                but moved slightly at the touch of my hand. I felt over and under 
                his blankets. There was no warmth, no sign of fire. Yet that smoke 
                which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source. 
                I lost my head temporarily, and dashed frantically about the steerage. 
                A collision with the table partly knocked the wind from my body 
                and brought me to myself. I reasoned that a helpless man could 
                start a fire only near to where he lay. </p>
              <p>　　I returned to Wolf Larsen's bunk. There I encountered Maud. 
                How long she had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could 
                not guess. </p>
              <p>　　'Go up on deck,' I commanded peremptorily. </p>
              <p>　　'But, Humphrey-' she began to protest in a queer, husky voice. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Please! please!' I shouted at her, harshly. </p>
              <p>　　She drew away obediently; and then I thought, What if she cannot 
                find the steps? I started after her, to stop at the foot of the 
                companionway. Perhaps she had gone up. As I stood there, hesitant, 
                I heard her cry softly: </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, Humphrey, I am lost!' </p>
              <p>　　I found her fumbling at the wall of the after-bulkhead, and, 
                half leading, half carrying her, I took her up the companionway. 
                The pure air was like nectar. Maud was only faint and dizzy, and 
                I left her lying on the deck when I took my second plunge below. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen: 
                my mind was made up to this, and I went straight to his bunk. 
                As I felt among his blankets, something hot fell on the back of 
                my hand. It burned me, and I jerked my hand away. Then I understood. 
                Through the cracks in the bottom of the upper bunk he had set 
                fire to the mattress. He still retained sufficient use of his 
                left arm to do this. The damp straw of the mattress, fired from 
                beneath and denied air, had been smoldering all the while. </p>
              <p>　　As I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate 
                in mid-air, at the same time bursting into flames. I beat out 
                the burning remnants of straw in the bulk, then made a dash for 
                the deck for fresh air. </p>
              <p>　　Several buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress 
                in the middle of the steerage floor; and ten minutes later, when 
                the smoke had fairly cleared, I allowed Maud to come below. Wolf 
                Larsen was unconscious, but it was a matter of minutes for the 
                fresh air to restore him. We were working over him, however, when 
                he signed for paper and pencil. </p>
              <p>　　'Pray do not interrupt me,' he wrote. 'I am smiling.' </p>
              <p>　　'I am still a bit of the ferment, you see,' he wrote a little 
                later. </p>
              <p>　　'I am glad you are as small a bit as you are,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Thank you,' he wrote. 'But just think of how much smaller 
                I shall be before I die.' </p>
              <p>　　'And yet I am all here, Hump,' he wrote with a final flourish. 
                'I can think more clearly than ever in my life before. Nothing 
                to disturb me. Concentration is perfect. I am all here and more 
                than here.' </p>
              <p>　　It was like a message from the night of the grave, for this 
                man's body had become his mausoleum. And there, in so strange 
                a sepulcher, his spirit fluttered and lived. It would flutter 
                and live till the last line of communication was broken, and after 
                that who was to say how much longer it might continue to flutter 
                and live?</p>

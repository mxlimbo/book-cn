              <p>　　I SEEMED SWINGING IN A mighty rhythm through orbit vastness. 
                Sparkling points of light spluttered and shot past me. They were 
                stars, I knew, and flaring comets, that peopled my flight among 
                the suns. As I reached the limit of my swing and prepared to rush 
                back on the counter-swing, a great gong struck, and thundered 
                and reverberated through abysmal space. For an immeasurable period, 
                quiescent, lapped in the rippling of placid centuries, I enjoyed 
                and pondered my tremendous flight. </p>
              <p>　　But a change came over the face of the dream, for a dream I 
                told myself it must be. My rhythm grew shorter and shorter. I 
                was jerked from swing to counter-swing with irritating haste. 
                I could scarcely catch my breath, so fiercely was I impelled through 
                the heavens. The gong thundered more frequently and more furiously. 
                I grew to await it with a nameless dread. Then it seemed as though 
                I were being dragged over rasping sands, white and hot in the 
                sun. This gave place to a sense of intolerable anguish. My skin 
                was scorching in the torment of fire. The gong clanged and knelled. 
                The sparkling points of light flashed past me in an interminable 
                stream, as though the whole sidereal system were dropping into 
                the void. I gasped, caught my breath painfully, and opened my 
                eyes. Two men were kneeling beside me, working over me. My mighty 
                rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea. The 
                terrific gong was a frying-pan, hanging on the wall, that rattled 
                and clattered with each leap of the ship. The rasping, scorching 
                sands were a man's hard hands chafing my naked chest. I squirmed 
                under the pain of it and half lifted my head. My chest was raw 
                and red, and I could see tiny blood-globules starting through 
                the torn and inflamed cuticle. </p>
              <p>　　'That'll do, Yonson,' one of the men said. 'Carn't yer see 
                you've bloomin' well rubbed all the gent's skin off?' </p>
              <p>　　The man addressed as Yonson, a man of the heavy Scandinavian 
                type, ceased chafing me and arose awkwardly to his feet. The man 
                who had spoken to him was clearly a Cockney, with the clean lines 
                and weakly pretty, almost effeminate, face of the man who has 
                absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with his mother's milk. A draggled 
                muslin cap on his head, and a dirty gunny-sack about his slim 
                hips, proclaimed him cook of the decidedly dirty ship's galley 
                in which I found myself. </p>
              <p>　　'An' 'ow yer feelin' now, sir?' he asked, with the subservient 
                smirk which comes only of generations of tip-seeking ancestors. 
              </p>
              <p>　　For reply, I twisted weakly into a sitting posture, and was 
                helped by Yonson to my feet. The rattle and bang of the frying-pan 
                was grating horribly on my nerves. I could not collect my thoughts. 
                Clutching the woodwork of the galley for support,- and I confess 
                the grease with which it was scummed put my teeth on edge,- I 
                reached across a hot cooking-range to the offending utensil, unhooked 
                it, and wedged it securely into the coal-box. </p>
              <p>　　The cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves, and thrust into 
                my hand a steaming mug with an ''Ere, this'll do yer good.' </p>
              <p>　　It was a nauseous mess,- ship's coffee,- but the heat of it 
                was revivifying. Between gulps of the molten stuff I glanced down 
                at my raw and bleeding chest and turned to the Scandinavian. </p>
              <p>　　'Thank you, Mr. Yonson,' I said; 'but don't you think your 
                measures were rather heroic?' </p>
              <p>　　It was because he understood the reproof of my action, rather 
                than of my words, that he held up his palm for inspection. It 
                was remarkably calloused. I passed my hand over the horny projections, 
                and my teeth went on edge once more from the horrible rasping 
                sensation produced. </p>
              <p>　　'My name is Johnson, not Yonson,' he said in very good, though 
                slow, English, with no more than a shade of accent to it. </p>
              <p>　　There was mild protest in his pale-blue eyes, and, withal, 
                a timid frankness and manliness that quite won me to him. </p>
              <p>　　'Thank you, Mr. Johnson,' I corrected, and reached out my hand 
                for his. </p>
              <p>　　He hesitated, awkward and bashful, shifted his weight from 
                one leg to the other, then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty 
                shake. </p>
              <p>　　'Have you any dry clothes I may put on?' I asked the cook. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, sir,' he answered, with cheerful alacrity. 'I'll run 
                down an' tyke a look over my kit, if you've no objections, sir, 
                to wearin' my things.' </p>
              <p>　　He dived out of the galley door, or glided, rather, with a 
                swiftness and smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so 
                much cat-like as oily. In fact, this oiliness, or greasiness, 
                as I was later to learn, was probably the most salient expression 
                of his personality. </p>
              <p>　　'And where am I?' I asked Johnson, whom I took, and rightly, 
                to be one of the sailors. 'What vessel is this? And where is she 
                bound?' </p>
              <p>　　'Off the Farralones, heading about sou'west,' he answered slowly 
                and methodically, as though groping for his best English, and 
                rigidly observing the order of my queries. 'The schooner Ghost; 
                bound seal-hunting to Japan.' </p>
              <p>　　'And who is the captain? I must see him as soon as I am dressed?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Johnson looked puzzled and embarrassed. He hesitated while 
                he groped in his vocabulary and framed a complete answer. 'The 
                cap'n is Wolf Larsen, or so men call him. I never heard his other 
                name. But you better speak soft with him. He is mad this morning. 
                The mate-' </p>
              <p>　　But he did not finish. The cook had glided in. </p>
              <p>　　'Better sling yer 'ook out of 'ere, Yonson,' he said. 'The 
                Old Man'll be wantin' yer on deck, an' this ayn't no d'y to fall 
                foul of 'im.' </p>
              <p>　　Johnson turned obediently to the door, at the same time, over 
                the cook's shoulder, favoring me with an amazingly solemn and 
                portentous wink, as though to emphasize his interrupted remark 
                and the need for me to be soft-spoken with the captain. </p>
              <p>　　Hanging over the cook's arm was a loose and crumpled array 
                of evil-looking and sour-smelling garments. </p>
              <p>　　'They was put aw'y wet, sir,' he vouchsafed explanation. 'But 
                you'll 'ave to make them do while I dry yours out by the fire.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Clinging to the woodwork, staggering with the roll of the ship, 
                and aided by the cook, I managed to slip into a rough woolen undershirt. 
                On the instant my flesh was creeping and crawling from the harsh 
                contact. He noticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing, and 
                smirked: </p>
              <p>　　'I only 'ope yer don't ever 'ave to get used to such as that 
                in this life, 'cos you've got a bloomin' soft skin, that you 'ave, 
                more like a lydy's than any I know of. I was bloomin' well sure 
                you was a gentleman as soon as I set eyes on yer.' </p>
              <p>　　I had taken a dislike to him at the first, and as he helped 
                to dress me this dislike increased. There was something repulsive 
                about his touch. I shrank from his hand; my flesh revolted. And 
                between this and the smells arising from various pots boiling 
                and bubbling on the galley fire, I was in haste to get out into 
                the fresh air. Further, there was the need of seeing the captain 
                about what arrangements could be made for getting me ashore. </p>
              <p>　　A cheap cotton shirt, with frayed collar and a bosom discolored 
                with what I took to be ancient bloodstains, was put on me amidst 
                a running and apologetic fire of comment. A pair of workman's 
                brogans incased my feet, and for trousers I was furnished with 
                a pair of pale-blue, washed-out overalls, one leg of which was 
                fully ten inches shorter than the other. The abbreviated leg looked 
                as though the devil had there clutched for the Cockney's soul 
                and missed the shadow for the substance. </p>
              <p>　　'And whom have I to thank for this kindness?' I asked, when 
                I stood completely arrayed, a tiny boy's cap on my head, and for 
                coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of 
                my back, and the sleeves of which reached just below my elbows. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The cook drew himself up in smugly humble fashion, a deprecating 
                smirk on his face. Out of my experience with stewards on the Atlantic 
                liners at the end of the voyage, I could have sworn he was waiting 
                for his tip. From my fuller knowledge of the creature I now know 
                that the posture was unconscious. An hereditary servility, no 
                doubt, was responsible. </p>
              <p>　　'Mugridge, sir,' he fawned, his effeminate features running 
                into a greasy smile. 'Thomas Mugridge, sir, an' at yer service.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'All right, Thomas,' I said. 'I shall not forget you- when 
                my clothes are dry.' </p>
              <p>　　A soft light suffused his face, and his eyes glistened, as 
                though somewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had quickened 
                and stirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Thank you, sir,' he said very gratefully and very humbly indeed. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Precisely in the way that the door slid back, he slid aside, 
                and I stepped out on deck. I was still weak from my prolonged 
                immersion. A puff of wind caught me, and I staggered across the 
                moving deck to a corner of the cabin, to which I clung for support. 
                The schooner, heeled over far out from the perpendicular, was 
                bowing and plunging into the long Pacific roll. If she were heading 
                southwest, as Johnson had said, the wind, then, I calculated, 
                was blowing nearly from the south. The fog was gone, and in its 
                place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the water. I 
                turned to the east, where I knew California must lie, but could 
                see nothing save low-lying fog-banks- the same fog, doubtless, 
                that had brought about the disaster to the Martinez and placed 
                me in my present situation. To the north, not far away, a group 
                of naked rocks thrust above the sea, on one of which I could distinguish 
                a lighthouse. In the southwest, and almost in our course, I saw 
                the pyramidal loom of some vessel's sails. </p>
              <p>　　Having completed my survey of the horizon, I turned to my more 
                immediate surroundings. My first thought was that a man who had 
                come through a collision and rubbed shoulders with death merited 
                more attention than I received. Beyond a sailor at the wheel, 
                who stared curiously across the top of the cabin, I attracted 
                no notice whatever. </p>
              <p>　　Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amidships. 
                There, on a hatch, a large man was lying on his back. He was fully 
                clothed, though his shirt was ripped open in front. Nothing was 
                to be seen of his chest, however, for it was covered with a mass 
                of black hair, in appearance like the furry coat of a dog. His 
                face and neck were hidden beneath a black beard, intershot with 
                gray, which would have been stiff and bushy had it not been limp 
                and draggled and dripping with water. His eyes were closed, and 
                he was apparently unconscious; but his mouth was wide open, his 
                breast heaving as though from suffocation as he labored noisily 
                for breath. A sailor, from time to time and quite methodically, 
                as a matter of routine, dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean 
                at the end of a rope, hauled it in hand under hand, and sluiced 
                its contents over the prostrate man. </p>
              <p>　　Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchway, and savagely 
                chewing the end of a cigar, was the man whose casual glance had 
                rescued me from the sea. His height was probably five feet ten 
                inches, or ten and a half; but my first impression or feel of 
                the man was not of this, but of his strength. And yet, while he 
                was of massive build, with broad shoulders and deep chest, I could 
                not characterize his strength as massive. It was what might be 
                termed a sinewy, knotty strength, of the kind we ascribe to lean 
                and wiry men, but which, in him, because of his heavy build, partook 
                more of the enlarged gorilla order. Not that in appearance he 
                seemed in the least gorilla-like. What I am striving to express 
                is this strength itself, more as a thing apart from his physical 
                semblance. It was a strength we are wont to associate with things 
                primitive, with wild animals and the creatures we imagine our 
                tree-dwelling prototypes to have been- a strength savage, ferocious, 
                alive in itself, the essence of life in that it is the potency 
                of motion, the elemental stuff itself out of which the many forms 
                of life have been molded. </p>
              <p>　　Such was the impression of strength I gathered from this man 
                who paced up and down. He was firmly planted on his legs; his 
                feet struck the deck squarely and with surety: every movement 
                of a muscle, from the heave of the shoulders to the tightening 
                of the lips about the cigar, was decisive and seemed to come out 
                of a strength that was excessive and overwhelming. In fact, though 
                this strength pervaded every action of his, it seemed but the 
                advertisement of a greater strength that lurked within, that lay 
                dormant and no more than stirred from time to time, but which 
                might arouse at any moment, terrible and compelling, like the 
                rage of a lion or the wrath of a storm. </p>
              <p>　　The cook stuck his head out of the galley door and grinned 
                encouragingly at me, at the same time jerking his thumb in the 
                direction of the man who paced up and down by the hatchway. Thus 
                I was given to understand that he was the captain, the 'Old Man,' 
                in the cook's vernacular, the person whom I must interview and 
                put to the trouble of somehow getting me ashore. I had half started 
                forward, to get over with what I was certain would be a stormy 
                quarter of an hour, when a more violent suffocating paroxysm seized 
                the unfortunate person who was lying on his back. He writhed about 
                convulsively. The chin, with the damp black beard, pointed higher 
                in the air as the back muscles stiffened and the chest swelled 
                in an unconscious and instinctive effort to get more air. </p>
              <p>　　The captain, or Wolf Larsen, as men called him, ceased pacing, 
                and gazed down at the dying man. So fierce had this final struggle 
                become that the sailor paused in the act of flinging more water 
                over him, and stared curiously, the canvas bucket partly tilted 
                and dripping its contents to the deck. The dying man beat a tattoo 
                on the hatch with his heels, straightened out his legs, stiffened 
                in one great, tense effort, and rolled his head from side to side. 
                Then the muscles relaxed, the head stopped rolling, and a sigh, 
                as of profound relief, floated upward from his lips. The jaw dropped, 
                the upper lip lifted, and two rows of tobacco-discolored teeth 
                appeared. It seemed as though his features had frozen into a diabolical 
                grin at the world he had left and outwitted. </p>
              <p>　　Then a most surprising thing occurred. The captain broke loose 
                upon the dead man like a thunderclap. Oaths rolled from his lips 
                in a continuous stream. And they were not namby-pamby oaths, or 
                mere expressions of indecency. Each word was a blasphemy, and 
                there were many words. They crisped and crackled like electric 
                sparks. I had never heard anything like it in my life, nor could 
                I have conceived it possible. With a turn for literary expression 
                myself, and a penchant for forcible figures and phrases, I appreciated 
                as no other listener, I dare say, the peculiar vividness and strength 
                and absolute blasphemy of his metaphors. The cause of it all, 
                as near as I could make out, was that the man, who was mate, had 
                gone on a debauch before leaving San Francisco, and then had the 
                poor taste to die at the beginning of the voyage and leave Wolf 
                Larsen short-handed. </p>
              <p>　　It should be unnecessary to state, at least to my friends, 
                that I was shocked. Oaths and vile language of any sort had always 
                been unutterably repellent to me. I felt a wilting sensation, 
                a sinking at the heart, and, I might just as well say, a giddiness. 
                To me death had always been invested with solemnity and dignity. 
                It had been peaceful in its occurrence, sacred in its ceremonial. 
                But death in its more sordid and terrible aspects was a thing 
                with which I had been unacquainted till now. As I say, while I 
                appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that swept 
                out of Wolf Larsen's mouth, I was inexpressibly shocked. But the 
                dead man continued to grin unconcernedly with a sardonic humor, 
                a cynical mockery and defiance. He was master of the situation.</p>

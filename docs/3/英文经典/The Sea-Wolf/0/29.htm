              <p>　　'FOOL!' I CRIED ALOUD in my vexation. </p>
              <p>　　I had unloaded the boat and carried its contents high up on 
                the beach, where I had set about making a camp. There was driftwood, 
                though not much, on the beach, and the sight of a coffee-tin I 
                had taken from the Ghost's larder had given me the idea of a fire. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Blithering idiot!' I was continuing. </p>
              <p>　　But Maud said, 'Tut! tut!' in gentle reproval, and then asked 
                why I was a blithering idiot. </p>
              <p>　　'No matches!' I groaned. 'Not a match did I bring! And now 
                we shall have no hot coffee, soup, tea, nor anything.' </p>
              <p>　　'Wasn't it er- Crusoe who rubbed sticks together?' she drawled. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But I have read the personal narratives of a score of shipwrecked 
                men who tried, and tried in vain,' I answered. 'I remember Winters, 
                a newspaper fellow with an Alaskan and Siberian reputation. Met 
                him at the Bibelot once, and he was telling us how he attempted 
                to make a fire with a couple of sticks. It was most amusing. He 
                told it inimitably, but it was the story of a failure. I remember 
                his conclusion, his black eyes flashing as he said: &quot;Gentlemen, 
                the South Sea Islander may do it, the Malay may do it, but, take 
                my word, it's beyond the white man.&quot;' </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, well, we've managed so far without it,' she said cheerfully; 
                'and there's no reason why we cannot still manage without it.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But think of the coffee!' I cried. 'It's good coffee, too. 
                I know; I took it from Larsen's private stores. And look at that 
                good wood.' </p>
              <p>　　I confess that I wanted the coffee badly, and I learned not 
                long afterward that the berry was likewise a little weakness of 
                Maud's. Besides, we had been so long on a cold diet that we were 
                numb inside as well as out. Anything warm would have been most 
                gratifying. But I complained no more, and set about making a tent 
                of the sail for Maud. </p>
              <p>　　I had looked upon it as a simple task, what with the oars, 
                mast, boom, and sprit, to say nothing of plenty of lines. But 
                as I was without experience, and as every detail was an experiment 
                and every successful detail an invention, the day was well gone 
                before her shelter was an accomplished fact. And then that night 
                it rained, and Maud was flooded out and driven back into the boat. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The next morning I dug a shallow ditch around the tent, and, 
                an hour later, a sudden gust of wind, whipping over the rocky 
                wall behind us, picked up the tent and smashed it down on the 
                sand thirty yards away. </p>
              <p>　　Maud laughed at my crestfallen expression, and I said: 'As 
                soon as the wind abates I intend going in the boat to explore 
                the island. There must be a station somewhere, and men. And ships 
                must visit the station. Some government must protect all these 
                seals. But I wish to have you comfortable before I start.' </p>
              <p>　　'I should like to go with you,' was all she said. </p>
              <p>　　'It would be better if you remained. You have had enough of 
                hardship. It is a miracle that you have survived. And it won't 
                be comfortable in the boat, rowing and sailing in this rainy weather. 
                What you need is rest, and I should like you to remain and get 
                it.' </p>
              <p>　　Something suspiciously akin to moistness dimmed her beautiful 
                eyes before she dropped them and partly turned away her head. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I should prefer going with you,' she said in a low voice, 
                in which there was just a hint of appeal. </p>
              <p>　　'I might be able to help you a-' her voice broke- 'a little. 
                And if anything should happen to you, think of me left here alone.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, I intend being very careful,' I answered. 'And I shall 
                not go so far but what I can get back before night. Yes, all said 
                and done, I think it vastly better for you to remain and sleep 
                and rest and do nothing.' </p>
              <p>　　She turned and looked me in the eyes. Her gaze was soft but 
                unfaltering. </p>
              <p>　　'Please, please!' she said very softly. </p>
              <p>　　I stiffened myself to refuse, and shook my head. Still she 
                waited and looked at me, I tried to word my refusal, but wavered. 
                I saw the glad light spring into her eyes, and knew that I had 
                lost. It was impossible to say no after that. </p>
              <p>　　The wind died down in the afternoon, and we were prepared to 
                start the following morning. There was no way of penetrating the 
                island from our cove, for the walls rose perpendicularly from 
                the beach, and on each side of the cove rose from the deep water. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Morning broke dull and gray, but calm, and I was awake early 
                and had the boat in readiness. </p>
              <p>　　'Fool! Imbecile! Yahoo!' I shouted, when I thought it was meet 
                to arouse Maud; but this time I shouted in merriment as I danced 
                about the beach, bareheaded, in mock despair. </p>
              <p>　　Her head appeared under the flap of the sail. </p>
              <p>　　'What now?' she asked sleepily and, withal, curiously. </p>
              <p>　　'Coffee!' I cried. 'What do you say to a cup of coffee- hot 
                coffee, piping hot?' </p>
              <p>　　'My!' she murmured, 'you startled me. And you are cruel. Here 
                I have been composing my soul to do without it, and here you are 
                vexing me with your vain suggestions.' </p>
              <p>　　'Watch me,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　From under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks 
                and chips. These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling. 
                From my notebook I tore out a page, and from the ammunition-box 
                took a shotgun shell. Removing the wads from the latter with my 
                knife. I emptied the powder on a flat rock. Next I pried the primer, 
                or cap, from the shell, and laid it on the rock in the midst of 
                the scattered powder. All was ready. Maud still watched from the 
                tent. Holding the paper in my left hand, I smashed down upon the 
                cap with a rock held in my right. There was a puff of white smoke, 
                a burst of flame, and the rough edge of the paper was alight. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Maud clapped her hands gleefully. 'Prometheus!' she cried. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But I was far too busy to acknowledge her delight. The feeble 
                flame must be cherished tenderly if it were to gather strength 
                and live. I fed it shaving by shaving and sliver by sliver, till 
                at last it was snapping and crackling as it laid hold of the smaller 
                chips and sticks. To be cast away on an island had not entered 
                into my calculations, so we were without a kettle or cooking-utensils 
                of any sort; but I made shift with the tin used for baling the 
                boat, and later, as we consumed our supply of canned goods, we 
                accumulated quite an imposing array of cooking-vessels. </p>
              <p>　　I boiled the water, but it was Maud who made the coffee. And 
                how good it was! My contribution was canned beef fried with crumpled 
                sea-biscuit and water. The breakfast was a success, and we sat 
                about the fire much longer than enterprising explorers should 
                have done, sipping the hot black coffee and talking over our situation. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I was confident that we would find a station in some one of 
                the coves, for I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus 
                guarded; but Maud advanced the theory- to prepare me for disappointment, 
                I do believe, if disappointment were to come- that we had discovered 
                an unknown rookery. She was in very good spirits, however, and 
                made quite merry in accepting our plight as a grave one. </p>
              <p>　　'If you are right,' I said, 'then we must prepare to winter 
                here. Our food will not last, but there are the seals. They go 
                away in the fall, so I must soon begin to lay in a supply of meat. 
                Then there will be huts to build, and driftwood to gather. Also, 
                we shall try out seal fat for lighting purposes. Altogether, we'll 
                have our hands full if we find the island uninhabited. Which we 
                shall not, I know.' </p>
              <p>　　But she was right. We sailed with a beam wind along the shore, 
                searching the coves with our glasses, and landing occasionally, 
                without finding a sign of human life. Yet we learned that we were 
                not the first that had landed on Endeavor Island. High up on the 
                beach of the second cove from ours, we discovered the splintered 
                wreck of a boat- a sealer's boat, for the rowlocks were bound 
                in sennit, a gun-rack was on the starboard side of the bow, and 
                in white letters was faintly visible Gazelle No. 2. The boat had 
                lain there for a long time, for it was half filled with sand, 
                and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to 
                long exposure to the elements. In the stern-sheets I found a rusty 
                ten-gauge shotgun and a sailor's sheath-knife broken short across 
                and so rusted as to be almost unrecognizable. </p>
              <p>　　'They got away,' I said cheerfully; but I felt a sinking at 
                the heart and seemed to divine the presence of bleached bones 
                somewhere on that beach. </p>
              <p>　　I did not wish Maud's spirits to be dampened by such a find, 
                so I turned seaward again with our boat and skirted the northeastern 
                point of the island. There were no beaches on the southern shore, 
                and by early afternoon we rounded the black promontory and completed 
                the circumnavigation of the island. I estimated its circumference 
                at twenty-five miles, its width as varying from two to five miles; 
                while my most conservative calculation placed on its beaches two 
                hundred thousand seals. The island was highest at its extreme 
                southwestern point, the headlands and backbone diminishing regularly 
                until the northeastern portion was only a few feet above the sea. 
                With the exception of our little cove, the other beaches sloped 
                gently back for a distance of half a mile or so, into what I might 
                call rocky meadows, with here and there patches of moss and tundra 
                grass. Here the seals hauled out, and the old bulls guarded their 
                harems, while the young bulls hauled out by themselves. </p>
              <p>　　This brief description is all that Endeavor Island merits. 
                Damp and soggy where it was not sharp and rocky, buffeted by storm-winds 
                and lashed by the sea, with the air continually a-tremble with 
                the bellowing of two hundred thousand amphibians, it was a melancholy 
                and miserable sojourning-place. Maud, who had prepared me for 
                disappointment, and who had been sprightly and vivacious all day, 
                broke down as we landed in our own little cove. She strove bravely 
                to hide it from me, but while I was kindling another fire I knew 
                she was stifling her sobs in the blankets under the sail-tent. 
              </p>
              <p>　　It was my turn to be cheerful, and I played the part to the 
                best of my ability, and with such success that I brought the laughter 
                back into her dear eyes and song on her lips, for she sang to 
                me before she went to an early bed. It was the first time I had 
                heard her sing, and I lay by the fire, listening and transported; 
                for she was nothing if not an artist in everything she did, and 
                her voice, though not strong, was wonderfully sweet and expressive. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I still slept in the boat, and I lay awake long that night, 
                gazing up at the first stars I had seen in many nights and pondering 
                the situation. Responsibility of this sort was a new thing to 
                me. Wolf Larsen had been quite right. I had stood on my father's 
                legs. My lawyers and agents had taken care of my money for me. 
                I had had no responsibilities at all. Then, on the Ghost, I had 
                learned to be responsible for myself. And now, for the first time 
                in my life, I found myself responsible for some one else. And 
                it was required of me that this should be the gravest of responsibilities, 
                for she was the one woman in the world- the one small woman, as 
                I loved to think of her.</p>

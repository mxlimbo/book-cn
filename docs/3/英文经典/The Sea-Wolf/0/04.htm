              <p>　　WHAT HAPPENED TO ME NEXT on the sealing-schooner Ghost, as 
                I strove to fit into my new environment, are matters of humiliation 
                and pain. The cook, who was called 'the doctor' by the crew, 'Tommy' 
                by the hunters, and 'Cooky' by Wolf Larsen, was a changed personage. 
                The difference worked in my status brought about a corresponding 
                difference in treatment from him. Servile and fawning as he had 
                been before, he was now as domineering and bellicose. </p>
              <p>　　He absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr. Mugridge, 
                and his behavior and carriage were insufferable as he showed me 
                my duties. Besides my work in the cabin, with its four small staterooms, 
                I was supposed to be his assistant in the galley, and my colossal 
                ignorance concerning such things as peeling potatoes or washing 
                greasy pots was a source of unending and sarcastic wonder to him. 
                This was part of the attitude he chose to adopt toward me; and 
                I confess, before the day was done, that I hated him with more 
                lively feelings than I had ever hated any one in my life before. 
              </p>
              <p>　　This first day was made more difficult for me from the fact 
                that the Ghost, under close reefs (terms such as these I did not 
                learn till later), was plunging through what Mr. Mugridge called 
                an ''owlin' sou'easter.' At half-past five, under his directions, 
                I set the table in the cabin, with rough-weather trays in place, 
                and then carried the tea and cooked food down from the galley. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Look sharp or you'll get doused,' was Mr. Mugridge's parting 
                injunction as I left the galley with a big teapot in one hand 
                and in the hollow of the other arm several loaves of fresh-baked 
                bread. One of the hunters, a tall, loose-jointed chap named Henderson, 
                was going aft at the time from the steerage (the name the hunters 
                facetiously gave their amidships sleeping-quarters) to the cabin. 
                Wolf Larsen was on the poop, smoking his everlasting cigar. </p>
              <p>　　''Ere she comes! Sling yer 'ook!' the cook cried. </p>
              <p>　　I stopped, for I did not know what was coming, and saw the 
                galley door slide shut with a bang. Then I saw Henderson leaping 
                like a madman for the main rigging, up which he shot, on the inside, 
                till he was many feet higher than my head. Also, I saw a great 
                wave, curling and foaming, poised far above the rail. I was directly 
                under it. My mind did not work quickly, everything was so new 
                and strange. I grasped that I was in danger, but that was all. 
                I stood still, in trepidation. Then Wolf Larsen shouted from the 
                poop: </p>
              <p>　　'Grab hold something, you- you Hump!' </p>
              <p>　　But it was too late. I sprang toward the rigging, to which 
                I might have clung, and was met by the descending wall of water. 
                What happened after that was very confusing. I was beneath the 
                water, suffocating and drowning. My feet were out from under me, 
                and I was turning over and over and being swept along I knew not 
                where. Several times I collided against hard objects, once striking 
                my right knee a terrible blow. Then the flood seemed suddenly 
                to subside, and I was breathing the good air again. I had been 
                swept against the galley and around the steerage companionway 
                from the weather side into the lee scuppers. The pain from my 
                hurt knee was agonizing. I could not put my weight on it, or at 
                least I thought I could not put my weight on it; and I felt sure 
                the leg was broken. But the cook was after me, shouting through 
                the lee galley door: </p>
              <p>　　''Ere, you! Don't tyke all night about it! Where's the pot? 
                Lost overboard? Serve you bloody well right if yer neck was broke!' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I managed to struggle to my feet. The great teapot was still 
                in my hand. I limped to the galley and handed it to him. But he 
                was consuming with indignation, real or feigned. </p>
              <p>　　'Gawd blime me if you ayn't a slob. Wot're you good for, anyw'y, 
                I'd like to know. Eh? Wot're you good for, anyw'y? Cawn't even 
                carry a bit of tea aft without losin' it. Now I'll 'ave to boil 
                some more. </p>
              <p>　　'An' wot're you snifflin' about?' he burst out at me with renewed 
                rage. ''Cos you've 'urt yer pore little leg, pore little mama's 
                darlin'!' </p>
              <p>　　I was not sniffling, though my face might well have been drawn 
                and twitching from the pain. But I called up all my resolution, 
                set my teeth, and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin, 
                and cabin to galley, without further mishap. Two things I had 
                acquired by my accident: an injured kneecap that went undressed 
                and from which I suffered for weary months, and the name of 'Hump,' 
                which Wolf Larsen had called me from the poop. Thereafter, fore 
                and aft, I was known by no other name, until the term became a 
                part of my thought processes and I identified it with myself, 
                thought of myself as Hump, as though Hump were I and had always 
                been I. </p>
              <p>　　It was no easy task waiting on the cabin table, where sat Wolf 
                Larsen, Johansen, and the six hunters. The cabin was small, to 
                begin with, and to move around, as I was compelled to, was not 
                made easier by the schooner's violent pitching and wallowing. 
                But what struck me most forcibly was the total lack of sympathy 
                on the part of the men whom I served. I could feel my knee through 
                my clothes swelling up to the size of an apple, and I was sick 
                and faint from the pain of it. I could catch glimpses of my face, 
                white and ghastly, distorted with pain, in the cabin mirror. All 
                the men must have seen my condition, but not one spoke or took 
                notice of me, till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen later 
                on (I was washing the dishes) when he said: </p>
              <p>　　'Don't let a little thing like that bother you. You'll get 
                used to such things in time. It may cripple you some, but, all 
                the same, you'll be learning to walk. That's what you call a paradox, 
                isn't it?' he added. </p>
              <p>　　He seemed pleased when I nodded my head with the customary 
                'Yes, sir.' </p>
              <p>　　'I suppose you know a bit about literary things? Eh? Good. 
                I'll have some talks with you sometime.' </p>
              <p>　　And then, taking no further account of me, he turned his back 
                and went up on deck. </p>
              <p>　　That night, when I had finished an endless amount of work, 
                I was sent to sleep in the steerage, where I made up a spare bunk. 
                I was glad to get out of the detestable presence of the cook and 
                to be off my feet. To my surprise, my clothes had dried on me, 
                and there seemed no indications of catching cold either from the 
                last soaking or from the prolonged soaking after the foundering 
                of the Martinez. Under ordinary circumstances, after all that 
                I had undergone I should have been a fit subject for a funeral. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But my knee was bothering me terribly. As well as I could make 
                out, the kneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the 
                swelling. As I sat in my bunk examining it (the six hunters were 
                all in the steerage, smoking, and talking in loud voices), Henderson 
                took a passing glance at it. </p>
              <p>　　'Looks nasty,' he commented. 'Tie a rag around it, and it'll 
                be all right.' </p>
              <p>　　That was all. And on the land I should have been lying on the 
                broad of my back, with a surgeon attending me, and with strict 
                injunctions to do nothing but rest. But I must do these men justice. 
                Callous as they were to my suffering, they were equally callous 
                to their own when anything befell them. And this was due, I believe, 
                first to habit and second to the fact that they were less sensitively 
                organized. I really believe that a finely organized, high-strung 
                man would suffer twice or thrice as much as they from a like injury. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Tired as I was, exhausted in fact, I was prevented from sleeping 
                by the pain in my knee. It was all I could do to keep from groaning 
                aloud. At home I should undoubtedly have given vent to my anguish, 
                but this new and elemental environment seemed to call for a savage 
                repression. Like the savage, the attitude of these men was stoical 
                in great things, childish in little things. I remember, later 
                in the voyage, seeing Kerfoot, another of the hunters, lose a 
                finger by having it smashed to a jelly; and he did not even murmur 
                or change the expression on his face. Yet I have seen the same 
                man, time and again, fly into the most outrageous passion over 
                a trifle. </p>
              <p>　　He was doing it now, vociferating, bellowing, waving his arms, 
                and cursing like a fiend, and all because of a disagreement with 
                another hunter as to whether a seal-pup knew instinctively how 
                to swim. He held that it did; that it could swim the moment it 
                was born. The other hunter, Latimer, a lean Yankee-looking fellow, 
                with shrewd, narrow-slitted eyes, held otherwise; held that the 
                seal-pup was born on the land for no other reason than that it 
                could not swim; that its mother was compelled to teach it to swim, 
                as birds were compelled to teach their nestlings how to fly. </p>
              <p>　　For the most part, the remaining four hunters leaned on the 
                table or lay in their bunks and left the discussion to the two 
                antagonists. But they were supremely interested, for every little 
                while they ardently took sides, and sometimes all were talking 
                at once, till their voices surged back and forth in waves of sound 
                like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined space. Childish and immaterial 
                as the topic was, the quality of their reasoning was still more 
                childish and immaterial. In truth, there was very little reasoning 
                or none at all. Their method was one of assertion, assumption, 
                and denunciation. They proved that a seal-pup could swim or not 
                swim at birth by stating the proposition very bellicosely and 
                then following it up with an attack on the opposing man's judgment, 
                common sense, nationality, or past history. Rebuttal was similar 
                in all respects. I have related this in order to show the mental 
                caliber of the men with whom I was thrown in contact. Intellectually 
                they were children, inhabiting the physical bodies of men. </p>
              <p>　　And they smoked, incessantly smoked, using a coarse, cheap, 
                and offensive-smelling tobacco. The air was thick and murky with 
                the smoke of it; and this, combined with the violent movement 
                of the ship as she struggled through the storm, would surely have 
                made me seasick had I been a victim to that malady. As it was, 
                it made me quite squeamish, though this nausea might have been 
                due to the pain of my leg and my exhaustion. </p>
              <p>　　As I lay there thinking, I naturally dwelt upon myself and 
                my situation. It was unparalleled, undreamed-of, that I, Humphrey 
                Van Weyden, a scholar and a dilettante, if you please, in things 
                artistic and literary, should be lying here on a Bering Sea seal-hunting 
                schooner. Cabin-boy! I had never done any hard manual labor, or 
                scullion labor, in my life. I had lived a placid, uneventful sedentary 
                existence all my days- the life of a scholar and a recluse on 
                an assured and comfortable income. Violent life and athletic sports 
                had never appealed to me. I had always been a bookworm; so my 
                sisters and father had called me during my childhood. I had gone 
                camping but once in my life, and then I left the party almost 
                at its start and returned to the comforts and conveniences of 
                a roof. And here I was, with dreary and endless vistas before 
                me of table-setting, potato-peeling, and dishwashing. And I was 
                not strong. The doctors had always said that I had a remarkable 
                constitution, but I had never developed it or my body through 
                exercise. My muscles were small and soft, like a woman's, or so 
                the doctors had said time and again in the course of their attempts 
                to persuade me to go in for physical-culture fads. But I had preferred 
                to use my head rather than my body; and here I was, in no fit 
                condition for the rough life in prospect. </p>
              <p>　　These are merely a few of the things that went through my mind, 
                and are related for the sake of vindicating in advance the weak 
                and helpless role I was destined to play. But I thought also of 
                my mother and sisters, and pictured their grief. I was among the 
                missing dead of the Martinez disaster, an unrecovered body. I 
                could see the headlines in the papers, the fellows at the University 
                Club and the Bibelot shaking their heads and saying, 'Poor Chap!' 
                And I could see Charley Furuseth, as I had said good-by to him 
                that morning, lounging in a dressing-gown on the be-pillowed window-couch 
                and delivering himself of oracular and pessimistic epigrams. </p>
              <p>　　And all the while, rolling, plunging, climbing the moving mountains 
                and falling and wallowing in the foaming valleys, the schooner 
                Ghost was fighting her way farther and farther into the heart 
                of the Pacific- and I was on her. I could hear the wind above. 
                It came to my ears as a muffled roar. Now and again feet stamped 
                overhead. An endless creaking was going on all about me, the woodwork 
                and the fittings groaning and squeaking and complaining in a thousand 
                keys. The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human, 
                amphibious breed. The air was filled with oaths and indecent expressions. 
                I could see their faces, flushed and angry, the brutality distorted 
                and emphasized by the sickly yellow of the sea-lamps, which rocked 
                back and forth with the ship. Through the dim smoke-haze the bunks 
                looked like the sleeping-dens of animals in a menagerie. Oilskins 
                and sea-boots were hanging from the walls, and here and there 
                rifles and shotguns rested securely in the racks. It was a sea-fitting 
                for the buccaneers and pirates of bygone years. My imagination 
                ran riot, and still I could not sleep. And it was a long, long 
                night, weary and dreary and long.</p>

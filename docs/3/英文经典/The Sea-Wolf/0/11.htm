<p>　　THE GHOST HAS ATTAINED the southernmost point of the arc she 
                is describing across the Pacific, and is already beginning to 
                edge away to the west and north toward some lone island, it is 
                rumored, where she will fill her water-casks before proceeding 
                to the season's hunt along the coast of Japan. The hunters have 
                experimented and practiced with their rifles and shotguns till 
                they are satisfied, and the boat-pullers and steerers have made 
                their sprit-sails, bound the oars and rowlocks in leather and 
                sennit so that they will make no noise when creeping on the seals, 
                and put their boats in apple-pie order, to use Leach's homely 
                phrase. </p>
              <p>　　His arm, by the way, has healed nicely, though the scar will 
                remain all his life. Thomas Mugridge lives in mortal fear of him, 
                and is afraid to venture on deck after dark. There are two or 
                three standing quarrels in the forecastle. Louis tells me that 
                the gossip of the sailors finds its way aft, and that two of the 
                telltales have been badly beaten by their mates. He shakes his 
                head dubiously over the outlook for the man Johnson, who is boat-puller 
                in the same boat with him. Johnson has been guilty of speaking 
                his mind too freely, and has collided two or three times with 
                Wolf Larsen over the pronunciation of his name. Johansen he thrashed 
                on the amidships deck the other night, since which time the mate 
                has called him by his proper name. But of course it is out of 
                the question that Johnson should thrash Wolf Larsen. </p>
              <p>　　Louis has also given me additional information about Death 
                Larsen, which tallies with the captain's brief description. We 
                may expect to meet Death Larsen on the Japan coast. 'And look 
                out for squalls,' is Louis's prophecy, 'for they hate one another 
                like the wolf-whelps they are.' Death Larsen is in command of 
                the only sealing-steamer in the fleet, which carries fourteen 
                boats, where the schooners carry only six. There is wild talk 
                of cannon aboard, and of strange raids and expeditions she may 
                make, ranging from opium-smuggling into the States and arms-smuggling 
                into China, to black-birding and open piracy. Yet I cannot but 
                believe Louis, for I have never yet caught him in a lie, while 
                he has a cyclopedic knowledge of sealing and the men of the sealing-fleets. 
              </p>
              <p>　　As it is forward and in the galley, so it is in the steerage 
                and aft, on this veritable hell-ship. Men fight and struggle ferociously 
                for one another's lives. The hunters are looking for a shooting 
                scrape at any moment between Smoke and Henderson, whose old quarrel 
                has not healed, while Wolf Larsen says positively that he will 
                kill the survivor of the affair if such affair comes off. He frankly 
                states that the position he takes is based on no moral grounds, 
                that all the hunters could kill and eat one another, so far as 
                he is concerned, were it not that he needs them alive for the 
                hunting. If they will only hold their hands until the season is 
                over, he promises them a royal carnival, when all grudges can 
                be settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard 
                and arrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea. 
                I think even the hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness. 
                Wicked men though they be, they are certainly very much afraid 
                of him. </p>
              <p>　　Thomas Mugridge is cur-like in his subjection to me, while 
                I go about in secret dread of him. His is the courage of fear, 
                a strange thing I know well of myself, and at any moment it may 
                master the fear and impel him to the taking of my life. My knee 
                is much better, though it often aches for long periods, and the 
                stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf Larsen squeezed. 
                Otherwise I am in splendid condition, feel that I am in splendid 
                condition. My muscles are growing harder and increasing in size. 
                My hands, however, are a spectacle for grief. Also, I am suffering 
                from boils, due to the diet most likely, for I was never so afflicted 
                before. </p>
              <p>　　I was amused, a couple of evenings back, by seeing Wolf Larsen 
                reading the Bible, a copy of which, after the futile search for 
                one at the beginning of the voyage, had been found in the dead 
                mate's sea-chest. I wondered what Wolf Larsen could get from it, 
                and he read aloud to me from Ecclesiastes. I could imagine he 
                was speaking the thoughts of his own mind as he read to me, and 
                his voice, reverberating deeply and mournfully in the confined 
                cabin, charmed and held me. He may be uneducated, but he certainly 
                knows how to express the significance of the written word. I can 
                hear him now, as I shall always hear him, the primal melancholy 
                vibrant in his voice, as he read from Ecclesiastes the passage 
                beginning: 'I gathered me also silver and gold.' </p>
              <p>　　'There you have it, Hump,' he said, closing the book upon his 
                finger and looking up at me. 'The Preacher who was king over Israel 
                in Jerusalem thought as I think. You call me a pessimist. Is not 
                this pessimism of the blackest?- 'all is vanity and vexation of 
                spirit'; 'there is no profit under the sun'; 'there is one event 
                unto all,' to the fool and the wise, the clean and the unclean, 
                the sinner and the saint; and that event is death, and an evil 
                thing, he says. For the Preacher loved life, and did not want 
                to die, saying, 'For a living dog is better than a dead lion.' 
                He preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness 
                of the grave. And so I. To crawl is piggish; but to not crawl, 
                to be as the clod and rock, is loathsome to contemplate. It is 
                loathsome to the life that is in me, the very essence of which 
                is movement, the power of movement, and the consciousness of the 
                power of movement. Life itself is unsatisfaction, but to look 
                ahead to death is greater unsatisfaction.' </p>
              <p>　　'You are worse off than Omar,' I said. 'He, at least, after 
                the customary agonizing of youth, found content and made of his 
                materialism a joyous thing.' </p>
              <p>　　'Who was Omar?' Wolf Larsen asked, and I did no more work that 
                day, nor the next, or next. </p>
              <p>　　In his random reading he had never chanced upon the 'Rubaiyat,' 
                and it was to him like a great find of treasure. Much I remembered, 
                possibly two thirds of the quatrains, and I managed to piece out 
                the remainder without difficulty. We talked for hours over single 
                stanzas, and I found him reading into them a wail of regret and 
                a rebellion which for the life of me I could not discover myself. 
                Possibly I recited with a certain joyous lilt which was my own, 
                for- his memory was good, and at a second rendering, very often 
                the first, he made a quatrain his own- he recited the same lines 
                and invested them with an unrest and passionate revolt that were 
                well-nigh convincing. </p>
              <p>　　I was interested as to which quatrain he would like best, and 
                was not surprised when he hit upon the one born of an instant's 
                irritability and quite at variance with the Persian's complacent 
                philosophy and genial code of life: </p>
              <p>　　 What, without asking, hither hurried Whence? </p>
              <p>　　 And, without asking, Whither hurried hence! </p>
              <p>　　 Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine </p>
              <p>　　 Must drown the memory of that insolence! </p>
              <p>　　'Great!' Wolf Larsen cried. 'Great! That's the keynote. Insolence! 
                He could not have used a better word.' </p>
              <p>　　In vain I objected and denied. He deluged me, overwhelmed me 
                with argument. </p>
              <p>　　'It's not the nature of life to be otherwise. Life, when it 
                knows that it must cease living, will always rebel. It cannot 
                help itself. The Preacher found life and the works of life all 
                a vanity and vexation, an evil thing; but death, the ceasing to 
                be able to be vain and vexed, he found an eviler thing. Through 
                chapter after chapter he is worried by the one event that cometh 
                to all alike. So Omar, so I, so you, even you, for you rebelled 
                against dying when Cooky sharpened a knife for you. You were afraid 
                to die; the life that was in you, that composes you, that is greater 
                than you, did not want to die. You have talked of the instinct 
                of immortality. I talk of the instinct of life, which is to live, 
                and which, when death looms near and large, masters the instinct, 
                so called, of immortality. It mastered it in you (you cannot deny 
                it), because a crazy Cockney cook sharpened a knife. </p>
              <p>　　'You are afraid of him now. You are afraid of me. You cannot 
                deny it. If I catch you by the throat thus,'- his hand was about 
                my throat, and my breath was shut off,- 'and begin to press the 
                life out of you, thus, and thus, your instinct of immortality 
                will go glimmering, and your instinct of life, which is longing 
                for life, will flutter up, and you will struggle to save yourself. 
                Eh? I see the fear of death in your eyes. You beat the air with 
                your arms. You exert all your puny strength to struggle to live. 
                Your hand is clutching my arm; lightly it feels as a butterfly 
                resting there. Your chest is heaving, your tongue protruding, 
                your skin turning dark, your eyes swimming. &quot;To live! To 
                live! To live!&quot; you are crying; and you are crying to live 
                here and now, not hereafter. You doubt your immortality, eh? Ha! 
                ha! You are not sure of it. You won't chance it. This life only 
                you are certain is real. Ah, it is growing dark and darker. It 
                is the darkness of death, the ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, 
                the ceasing to move, that is gathering about you, descending upon 
                you, rising around you. Your eyes are becoming set. They are glazing. 
                My voice sounds faint and far. You cannot see my face. And still 
                you struggle in my grip. You kick with your legs. Your body draws 
                itself up in knots like a snake's. Your chest heaves and strains. 
                To live! To live! To live- ' </p>
              <p>　　I heard no more. Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness 
                he had so graphically described, and when I came to myself I was 
                lying on the floor, and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me 
                thoughtfully with that old, familiar light of curiosity in his 
                eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'Well, have I convinced you?' he demanded. 'Here, take a drink 
                of this. I want to ask you some questions.' </p>
              <p>　　I rolled my head negatively on the floor. 'Your arguments are 
                too- er- forcible,' I managed to articulate, at cost of great 
                pain to my aching throat. </p>
              <p>　　'You'll be all right in half an hour,' he assured me. 'And 
                I promise I won't use any more physical demonstrations. Get up 
                now. You can sit on a chair.' </p>
              <p>　　And, toy that I was of this monster, the discussion of Omar 
                and the Preacher was resumed. And half the night we sat up over 
                it.</p>

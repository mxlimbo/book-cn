              <p>　　'IT WILL SMELL,' I SAID, 'but it will keep in the heat and 
                keep out the rain and snow.' </p>
              <p>　　We were surveying the completed sealskin roof. </p>
              <p>　　'It is clumsy, but it will serve the purpose, and that is the 
                main thing,' I went on, yearning for her praise. </p>
              <p>　　And she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely 
                pleased. </p>
              <p>　　'But it is dark in here,' she said the next moment, her shoulders 
                shrinking with a little involuntary shiver. </p>
              <p>　　'You might have suggested a window when the walls were going 
                up,' I said. 'It was for you, and you should have seen the need 
                of a window.' </p>
              <p>　　'But I never do see the obvious, you know,' laughed back. 'And 
                besides, you can knock a hole in the wall at any time.' </p>
              <p>　　'Quite true; I had not thought of it,' I replied, wagging my 
                head sagely. 'But have you thought of ordering the window-glass? 
                Just call up the firm,- Red 4451 I think it is,- and tell them 
                what size and kind of glass you wish.' </p>
              <p>　　'That means-' she began. </p>
              <p>　　'No window.' </p>
              <p>　　It was a dark and evil-appearing thing, that hut, not fit for 
                aught better than swine in a civilized land; but for us who had 
                known the misery of the open boat it was a snug little habitation. 
                Following the housewarming, which was accomplished by means of 
                seal-oil and a wick made from cotton calking, came the hunting 
                for our winter's meat and the building of the second hut. It was 
                a simple affair, now, to go forth in the morning and return by 
                noon with a boat-load of seals. And then, while I worked at building 
                the hut, Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and kept a slow 
                fire under the frames of meat. I had heard of jerking beef on 
                the plains, and our seal-meat, cut in thin strips and hung in 
                the smoke, cured excellently. </p>
              <p>　　The second hut was easier to erect, for I built it against 
                the first and only three walls were required. But it was work, 
                hard work, all of it. Maud and I worked from dawn till dark, to 
                the limit of our strength, so that when night came we crawled 
                stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like sleep of exhaustion. 
                And yet she declared that she had never felt better nor stronger 
                in her life. I knew this was true of myself, but hers was such 
                a lily strength that I feared she would break down. Often and 
                often, her last reserve force gone, I have seen her stretched 
                flat on her back on the sand, in the way she had of resting and 
                recuperating. And then she would be up on her feet and toiling 
                as hard as ever. Where she obtained this strength was a marvel 
                to me. </p>
              <p>　　'Think of the long rest this winter,' was her reply to my remonstrances. 
                'Why, we'll be clamorous for something to do.' </p>
              <p>　　We held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed. It 
                was the end of the third day of a fierce storm that had swung 
                around the compass from the southeast to the northwest, and that 
                was then blowing directly in upon us. The beaches of the outer 
                cove were thundering with the surf, and even in our landlocked 
                inner cove a respectable sea was breaking. No high backbone of 
                island sheltered us from the wind, and it whistled and bellowed 
                about the hut till at times I feared for the strength of the walls. 
                The skin roof, stretched tightly as a drumhead, I had thought, 
                sagged and bellied with every gust; and innumerable interstices 
                in the walls, not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had supposed, 
                disclosed themselves. Yet the seal-oil burned brightly, and we 
                were warm and comfortable. </p>
              <p>　　It was a pleasant evening indeed, and we voted that as a social 
                even on Endeavor Island it had not yet been eclipsed. Our minds 
                were at ease. Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter 
                winter, but we were prepared for it. The seals could depart on 
                their mysterious journey into the south at any time, now, for 
                all we cared; and the storms held no terror for us. Not only were 
                we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered from the wind, but 
                we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that could be 
                made from moss. This had been Maud's idea, and she had herself 
                jealously gathered all the moss. This was to be my first night 
                on the mattress, and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because 
                she had made it. </p>
              <p>　　As she rose to go, she turned to me with the whimsical way 
                she had, and said: </p>
              <p>　　'Something is going to happen- is happening, for that matter. 
                I feel it. Something is coming here, to us. It is coming now. 
                I don't know what, but it is coming.' </p>
              <p>　　'Good or bad?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　She shook her head. 'I don't know, but it is there, somewhere.' 
                She pointed toward the sea and wind. </p>
              <p>　　'It's a lee shore,' I laughed, 'and I am sure I'd rather be 
                here than arriving a night like this.' </p>
              <p>　　'You are not frightened?' I asked, as I stepped to open the 
                door for her. </p>
              <p>　　Her eyes looked bravely into mine. </p>
              <p>　　'And you feel well? Perfectly well?' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Never better,' was her answer. </p>
              <p>　　We talked a little longer before she went. </p>
              <p>　　'Good night, Maud,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Good night, Humphrey,' she said. </p>
              <p>　　This use of our given names had come about quite as a matter 
                of course, and was as unpremeditated as it was natural. In that 
                moment I could have put my arms around her and drawn her to me. 
                I should certainly have done so out in that world to which we 
                belonged. As it was, the situation stopped there in the only way 
                it could; but I was left alone in my little hut, glowing warmly 
                through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and I knew that 
                a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us that had not existed 
                before. </p>

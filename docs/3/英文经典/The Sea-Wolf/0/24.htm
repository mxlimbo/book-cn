              <p>　　AMONG THE MOST VIVID memories of my life are those of the events 
                on the Ghost which occurred during the forty hours succeeding 
                the discovery of my love for Maud Brewster. I, who had lived my 
                life in quiet places, only to enter at the age of thirty-five 
                upon a court of the most irrational adventure I could have imagined, 
                never had more incident and excitement crammed into any forty 
                hours of my experience. Nor can I quite close my ears to a small 
                voice of pride which tells me I did not do so badly, all things 
                considered. </p>
              <p>　　To begin with, at the midday dinner Wolf Larsen informed the 
                hunters that they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage. It 
                was an unprecedented thing on sealing-schooners, where it is the 
                custom for the hunters to rank unofficially as officers. He gave 
                no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. Horner and Smoke 
                had been displaying a gallantry toward Maud Brewster, ludicrous 
                in itself and inoffensive to her, but to him evidently distasteful. 
              </p>
              <p>　　The announcement was received with black silence, though the 
                other four hunters glanced significantly at the two who had been 
                the cause of their banishment. Jock Horner, quiet as was his way, 
                gave no sign; but the blood surged darkly across Smoke's forehead, 
                and he half opened his mouth to speak. Wolf Larsen was watching 
                him, waiting for him, the steely glitter in his eyes; but Smoke 
                closed his mouth again without having said anything. </p>
              <p>　　'Anything to say?' the other demanded aggressively. </p>
              <p>　　It was a challenge, but Smoke refused to accept it. </p>
              <p>　　'About what?' he asked so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted, 
                while the others smiled. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, nothing,' Wolf Larsen said lamely. 'I just thought you 
                might want to register a kick.' </p>
              <p>　　'About what?' asked the imperturbable Smoke. </p>
              <p>　　Smoke's mates were now smiling broadly. His captain could have 
                killed him, and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not 
                Maud Brewster been present. For that matter, it was her presence 
                which enabled Smoke to act as he did. He was too discreet and 
                cautious a man to incur Wolf Larsen's anger at a time when that 
                anger could be expressed in terms stronger than words. I was in 
                fear that a struggle might take place, but a cry from the helmsman 
                made it easy for the situation to save itself. </p>
              <p>　　'Smoke ho!' the cry came down the open companionway. </p>
              <p>　　'How's it bear?' Wolf Larsen called up. </p>
              <p>　　'Dead astern, sir!' </p>
              <p>　　'Maybe it's a Russian,' suggested Latimer. </p>
              <p>　　His words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters. 
                A Russian could mean but one thing- a cruiser. The hunters, never 
                more than roughly aware of the position of the ship, nevertheless 
                knew that we were close to the boundaries of the forbidden sea, 
                while Wolf Larsen's record as a poacher was notorious. All eyes 
                centered upon him. </p>
              <p>　　'We're dead safe,' he assured them with a laugh. 'No salt-mines 
                this time, Smoke. But I'll tell you what- I'll lay odds of five 
                to one it's the Macedonia.' </p>
              <p>　　No one accepted his offer, and he went on: 'In which event 
                I'll lay ten to one there's trouble breezing up.' </p>
              <p>　　'No, thank you,' Latimer spoke up. 'I don't object to losing 
                my money, but I like to get a run for it, anyway. There never 
                was a time when there wasn't trouble when you and that brother 
                of yours got together, and I'll lay twenty to one on that.' </p>
              <p>　　A general smile followed, in which Wolf Larsen joined, and 
                the dinner went on smoothly, thanks to me, for he treated me abominably 
                the rest of the meal, sneering at me and patronizing me till I 
                was all a-tremble with suppressed rage. Yet I knew I must control 
                myself for Maud Brewster's sake, and I received my reward when 
                her eyes caught mine for a fleeting second, and they said as distinctly 
                as if she spoke, 'Be brave, be brave!' </p>
              <p>　　We left the table to go on deck, for a steamer was a welcome 
                break in the monotony of the sea on which we floated, while the 
                conviction that it was 'Death' Larsen and the Macedonia added 
                to the excitement. The stiff breeze and heavy sea which had sprung 
                up the previous afternoon had been moderating all the morning, 
                so that it was now possible to lower the boats for an afternoon's 
                hunt. The hunting promised to be profitable. We had sailed since 
                daylight across a sea barren of seals and were now running into 
                the herd. </p>
              <p>　　The smoke was still miles astern, but overhauling us rapidly, 
                when we lowered our boats. They spread out and struck a northerly 
                course across the ocean. Now and again we saw a sail lower, heard 
                the reports of the shotguns, and saw the sail go up again. The 
                seals were thick, the wind dying away; everything favored a big 
                catch. As we ran off to get our leeward position of the last lee 
                boat, we found the ocean fairly carpeted with sleeping seals. 
                They were all about us, thicker than I had ever seen them before, 
                in twos and threes and bunches, stretched full-length on the surface, 
                and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy young dogs. </p>
              <p>　　Under the approaching smoke the hull and upper works of a steamer 
                were growing larger and larger. It was the Macedonia. I read her 
                name through the glasses as she passed by scarcely a mile to starboard. 
                Wolf Larsen looked savagely at the vessel, while Maud Brewster 
                was curious. </p>
              <p>　　'Where is the trouble you were so sure was breezing up, Captain 
                Larsen?' she asked gaily. </p>
              <p>　　He glanced at her, a moment's amusement softening his features. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'What did you expect? That they'd come aboard and cut out throats?' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Something like that,' she confessed. 'You understand, seal-hunters 
                are so new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　He nodded his head. </p>
              <p>　　'Quite right, quite right. Your error is that you failed to 
                expect the worst.' </p>
              <p>　　'Why, what can be worse than cutting our throats?' she asked, 
                with pretty, naive surprise. </p>
              <p>　　'Cutting our purses,' he answered. 'Man is so made these days 
                that his capacity for living is determined by the money he possesses.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'&quot;Who steals my purse steals trash,&quot;' she quoted. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Who steals my purse steals my right to live,' was the reply, 
                'old saws to the contrary. For he steals my bread and meat and 
                bed, and in so doing imperils my life. There are not enough soup-kitchens 
                and bread-lines to go around, you know, and when men have nothing 
                in their purses they usually die, and die miserably- unless they 
                are able to fill their purses pretty speedily.' </p>
              <p>　　'But I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your 
                purse.' </p>
              <p>　　'Wait and you will see,' he answered grimly. </p>
              <p>　　We did not have long to wait. Having passed several miles beyond 
                our line of boats, the Macedonia proceeded to lower her own. We 
                knew she carried fourteen boats to our five (we were one-short 
                through the desertion of Wainwright), and she began dropping them 
                far to leeward of our last boat, continued dropping them athwart 
                our course, and finished dropping them far to windward of our 
                first weather boat. The hunting, for us, was spoiled. There were 
                no seals behind us, and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats, 
                like a huge broom, swept the herd before it. </p>
              <p>　　Our boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between 
                them and the point where the Macedonia's had been dropped, and 
                then headed for home. The wind had fallen to a whisper, the ocean 
                was growing calmer and calmer, and this, coupled with the presence 
                of the great herd, made a perfect hunting-day- one of the two 
                or three days to be encountered in the whole of a lucky season. 
                An angry lot of men, boat-pullers and steerers as well as hunters, 
                swarmed over our side. Each man felt that he had been robbed, 
                and the boats were hoisted in amid curses, which, if curses had 
                power, would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity- 'Dead 
                and damned for a dozen of eternities,' commented Louis, his eyes 
                twinkling up at me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings 
                of his boat. </p>
              <p>　　'Listen to them, and find if it is hard to discover the most 
                vital thing in their souls,' said Wolf Larsen. 'Faith, and love, 
                and high ideals? The good, the beautiful, the true?' </p>
              <p>　　'Their innate sense of right has been violated,' Maud Brewster 
                said, joining the conversation. </p>
              <p>　　She was standing a dozen feet away, one hand resting on the 
                main-shrouds and her body swaying gently to the slight roll of 
                the ship. She had not raised her voice, and yet I was struck by 
                its clear and bell-like tone. Ah, it was sweet in my ears! I scarcely 
                dared look at her just then, for fear of betraying myself. A small 
                boy's cap was perched on her head, and her hair, light brown and 
                arranged in a loose and fluffy order that caught the sun, seemed 
                an aureole about the delicate oval of her face. She was positively 
                bewitching, and, withal, sweetly spirituelle, if not saintly. 
                All my oldtime marvel at life returned to me at sight of this 
                splendid incarnation of it, and Wolf Larsen's cold explanation 
                of life and its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable. </p>
              <p>　　'A sentimentalist,' he sneered, 'like Mr. Van Weyden. Those 
                men are cursing because their desires have been outraged. That 
                is all. What desires? The desires for the good grub and soft beds 
                ashore which a handsome payday brings them- the women and the 
                drink, the gorging and the beastliness which so truly express 
                them, the best that is in them, their highest aspirations, their 
                ideals, if you please. The exhibition they make of their feelings 
                is not a touching sight, yet it shows how deeply they have been 
                touched, how deeply their purses have been touched; for to lay 
                hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls.' </p>
              <p>　　'You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched,' she 
                said smilingly. </p>
              <p>　　'Then it so happens that I am behaving differently, for my 
                purse and my soul have both been touched. At the current price 
                of skins in the London market, and based on a fair estimate of 
                what the afternoon's catch would have been had not the Macedonia 
                hogged it, the Ghost has lost about fifteen hundred dollars' worth 
                of skins.' </p>
              <p>　　'You speak so calmly- ' she began. </p>
              <p>　　'But I do not feel calm; I could kill the man who has robbed 
                me,' he interrupted. 'Yes, yes, I know, and that man my brother- 
                more sentiment! Bah!' </p>
              <p>　　His face underwent a sudden change. His voice was less harsh 
                and wholly sincere as he said: </p>
              <p>　　'You must be happy, you sentimentalists, really and truly happy 
                at dreaming and finding things good, and, because you find some 
                of them good, feeling good yourselves. Now, tell me, you two, 
                do you find me good?' </p>
              <p>　　'You are good to look upon- in a way,' I qualified. </p>
              <p>　　'There are in you all powers for good,' was Maud Brewster's 
                answer. </p>
              <p>　　'There you are!' he cried at her, half angrily. 'Your words 
                are empty to me. There is nothing clear and sharp and definite 
                about the thought you have expressed. You cannot pick it up in 
                your two hands and look at it. In point of fact, it is not a thought. 
                It is a feeling, a sentiment, a something based upon illusion, 
                and not a product of the intellect at all.' </p>
              <p>　　As he went on, his voice again grew soft, and a confiding note 
                came into it. 'Do you know, I sometimes catch myself wishing that 
                I, too, were blind to the facts of life and knew only its fancies 
                and illusions. They're wrong, all wrong, of course, and contrary 
                to reason, but in the face of them my reason tells me, wrong and 
                most wrong, that to dream and live illusions give greater delight. 
                And, after all, delight is the wage for living. Without delight, 
                living is a worthless act. To labor at living and be paid is worse 
                than to be dead. He who delights the most, lives the most, and 
                your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to you and most 
                gratifying than are my facts to me.' </p>
              <p>　　He shook his head slowly, pondering. </p>
              <p>　　'I often doubt the worthwhileness of reason. Dreams must be 
                more substantial and satisfying. Emotional delight is more filling 
                and lasting than intellectual delight; and, besides, you pay for 
                your moments of intellectual delight by having the blues. Emotional 
                delight is followed by no more than jaded senses, which speedily 
                recuperate. I envy you, I envy you.' He stopped abruptly, and 
                then on his lips formed one of his strange quizzical smiles, as 
                he added: 'It's from my brain I envy you, take notice, and not 
                from my heart. My reason dictates it. The envy is an intellectual 
                product. I am like a sober man looking upon drunken men, and, 
                greatly weary, wishing he, too, were drunk.' </p>
              <p>　　'Or like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he, too, 
                were a fool,' I laughed. </p>
              <p>　　'Quite so,' he said. 'You are blessed, bankrupt pair of fools. 
                You have no facts in your pocketbook.' </p>
              <p>　　'Yet we spend as freely as you,' was Maud Brewster's contribution. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'More freely, because it costs you nothing.' </p>
              <p>　　'And because we draw upon eternity,' she retorted. </p>
              <p>　　'Whether you do or think you do, it's the same thing. You spend 
                what you haven't got, and in return you get greater value from 
                spending what you haven't got than I get from spending what I 
                have got and what I have sweated to get.' </p>
              <p>　　'Why don't you change the basis of your coinage, then?' she 
                queried teasingly. </p>
              <p>　　He looked at her quickly, half hopefully, and then said, all 
                regretfully: 'Too late. I'd like to, perhaps, but I can't. My 
                pocketbook is stuffed with the old coinage, and it's a stubborn 
                thing. I can never bring myself to recognize anything else as

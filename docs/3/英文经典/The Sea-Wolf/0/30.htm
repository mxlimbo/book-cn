          <tr> 
            <td> 
              <p>　　NO WONDER WE CALLED IT Endeavor Island. For two weeks we toiled 
                at building a hut. Maud insisted on helping, and I could have 
                wept over her bruised and bleeding hands. And still, I was proud 
                of her because of it. There was something heroic about this gently 
                bred woman enduring our terrible hardship and with her pittance 
                of strength bending to the tasks of a peasant woman. She gathered 
                many of the stones that I built into the walls of the hut; also, 
                she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I begged her to desist. 
                She compromised, however, by taking upon herself the lighter labors 
                of cooking and of gathering driftwood and moss for our winter's 
                supply. </p>
              <p>　　The hut's walls rose without difficulty, and everything went 
                smoothly until the problem of the roof confronted me. Of what 
                use the four walls without a roof? And of what could a roof be 
                made? There were the spare oars, very true. They would serve as 
                roof-beams; but with what was I to cover them? Moss would never 
                do. Tundra grass was impracticable. We needed the sail for the 
                boat, and the tarpaulin had begun to leak. </p>
              <p>　　'Winters used walrus-skins on his hut,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'There are the seals,' she suggested. </p>
              <p>　　So next day the hunting began. I did not know how to shoot, 
                but I proceeded to learn. And when I had expended some thirty 
                shells for three seals, I decided that the ammunition would be 
                exhausted before I acquired the necessary knowledge. I had used 
                eight shells for lighting fires before I hit upon the device of 
                banking the embers with wet moss, and there remained not over 
                a hundred shells in the box. </p>
              <p>　　'We must club the seals,' I announced, when convinced of my 
                poor marksmanship. 'I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing 
                them.' </p>
              <p>　　'They are so pretty,' she objected. 'I cannot bear to think 
                of it being done. It is so directly brutal, you know, so different 
                from shooting them.' </p>
              <p>　　'That roof must go on,' I answered grimly. 'Winter is almost 
                here. It is our lives against theirs. It is unfortunate we haven't 
                plenty of ammunition, but I think, anyway, that they suffer less 
                from being clubbed than from being all shot up. Besides, I shall 
                do the clubbing.' </p>
              <p>　　'That's just it,' she began eagerly, and broke off in sudden 
                confusion. </p>
              <p>　　'Of course,' I began, 'if you prefer-' </p>
              <p>　　'But what shall I be doing?' she interrupted, with that softness 
                I knew full well to be insistence. </p>
              <p>　　'Gathering firewood and cooking dinner,' I answered lightly. 
              </p>
              <p>　　She shook her head. 'It is too dangerous for you to attempt 
                alone.' </p>
              <p>　　'I know, I know,' she waived my protest. 'I am only a weak 
                woman, but just my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But the clubbing?' I suggested. </p>
              <p>　　'Of course you will do that. I shall probably scream. I'll 
                look away when-' </p>
              <p>　　'The danger is most serious,' I laughed. </p>
              <p>　　'I shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look,' 
                she replied, with a grand air. </p>
              <p>　　The upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning. 
                I rowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach. 
                There were seals all about us in the water, and the bellowing 
                thousands on the beach compelled us to shout at each other to 
                make ourselves heard. </p>
              <p>　　'I know men club them,' I said, trying to reassure myself, 
                and gazing doubtfully at a large bull, not thirty feet away, upreared 
                on his fore flippers and regarding me intently. 'But the question 
                is, how do they club them?' </p>
              <p>　　'Let us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof,' Maud said. 
              </p>
              <p>　　She was as frightened as I at the prospect, and we had reason 
                to be, gazing at close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like 
                mouths. </p>
              <p>　　'I always thought they were afraid of men,' I said. 'How do 
                I know they are not afraid?' I queried a moment later, after having 
                rowed a few more strokes along the beach. 'Perhaps if I were to 
                step boldly ashore, they would cut for it and I could not catch 
                up with one.' </p>
              <p>　　And still I hesitated. </p>
              <p>　　'I heard of a man once that invaded the nesting-grounds of 
                wild geese,' Maud said. 'They killed him.' </p>
              <p>　　'The geese?' </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, the geese. My brother told me about it when I was a little 
                girl.' </p>
              <p>　　'But I know men club them,' I persisted. </p>
              <p>　　'I think the tundra grass will make just as good a roof,' she 
                said. </p>
              <p>　　Far from her intention, her words were maddening me, driving 
                me on. I could not play the coward before her eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'Here goes,' I said, backing water with one oar and running 
                the bow ashore. </p>
              <p>　　I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull 
                in the midst of his wives. I was armed with the regular club with 
                which the boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard 
                by the hunters. It was only a foot and a half long, and in my 
                superb ignorance I never dreamed that the club used ashore when 
                raiding the rookeries measured four or five feet. The cows lumbered 
                out of my way, and the distance between me and the bull decreased. 
                He raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement. We were 
                a dozen feet apart. Still I advanced steadily, looking for him 
                to turn tail at any moment and run. </p>
              <p>　　At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind: What if 
                he will not run? Why, then I shall club him, came the answer. 
                In my fear I had forgotten that I was there to get the bull instead 
                of to make him run. And just then he gave a snort and a snarl 
                and rushed at me. His eyes were blazing, his mouth was wide open; 
                the teeth gleamed cruelly white. Without shame, I confess that 
                it was I that turned tail and footed it. He ran awkwardly, but 
                he ran well. He was but two paces behind when I tumbled into the 
                boat, and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down 
                upon the blade. The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell. 
                Maud and I were astounded. A moment later he had dived under the 
                boat, seized the keel in his mouth, and was shaking the boat violently. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'My!' said Maud. 'Let's go back.' </p>
              <p>　　I shook my head. 'I can do what other men have done, and I 
                know that other men have clubbed seals. But I think I'll leave 
                the bulls alone next time. </p>
              <p>　　'I wish you wouldn't,' she said. </p>
              <p>　　'Now don't say, &quot;Please, please,&quot;' I cried, half 
                angrily, I do believe. </p>
              <p>　　She made no reply, and I knew my tone must have hurt her. </p>
              <p>　　'I beg your pardon,' I said, or shouted, rather, in order to 
                make myself heard above the roar of the rookery. 'If you say so, 
                I'll turn and go back; but honestly, I'd rather stay.' </p>
              <p>　　'Now, don't say that this is what you get for bringing a woman 
                along,' she said. She smiled at me whimsically, gloriously, and 
                I knew there was no need for forgiveness. </p>
              <p>　　I rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover 
                my nerves, and then stepped ashore again. </p>
              <p>　　'Do be cautious!' she called after me. </p>
              <p>　　I nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the 
                nearest harem. All went until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow's 
                head and fell short. She snorted and tried to scramble away. I 
                ran in close and struck another blow, hitting the shoulder instead 
                of the head. </p>
              <p>　　'Look out!' I heard Maud scream. </p>
              <p>　　In my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things, 
                and I looked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon 
                me. Again I fled to the boat, hotly pursued; but this time Maud 
                made no suggestion of turning back. </p>
              <p>　　'It would be better, I imagine, if you let harems alone and 
                devoted your attention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals,' 
                was what she said. 'I think I have read something about them- 
                Dr. Jordan's book, I believe. They are the young bulls, not old 
                enough to have harems of their own. He called them the holluschickie, 
                or something like that. It seems to me, if we find where they 
                haul out-' </p>
              <p>　　'It seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused,' I 
                laughed. </p>
              <p>　　She flushed quickly and prettily. 'I'll admit I don't like 
                defeat any more than you do, nor any more than I like the idea 
                of killing such pretty, inoffensive creatures.' </p>
              <p>　　'Pretty!' I sniffed. 'I failed to mark anything preeminently 
                pretty about those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me.' </p>
              <p>　　'Your point of view,' she laughed. 'You lacked perspective. 
                Now if you did not have to get so close to the subject-' </p>
              <p>　　'The very thing!' I cried. 'What I need is a longer club. And 
                there's that broken oar ready to hand.' </p>
              <p>　　'It just comes to me,' she said, 'that Captain Larsen was telling 
                me how the men raided the rookeries. They drive the seals, in 
                small herds, a short distance inland before they kill them.' </p>
              <p>　　'I don't care to undertake the herding of one of those harems,' 
                I objected. </p>
              <p>　　'But there are the holluschickie,' she said. 'The holluschickie 
                haul out by themselves, and Dr. Jordan says that paths are left 
                between the harems, and that as long as the holluschickie keep 
                strictly to the paths they are unmolested by the masters of the 
                harem.' </p>
              <p>　　'There's one now,' I said, pointing to a young bull in the 
                water. 'Let's watch him and follow him if he hauls out.' </p>
              <p>　　He swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small 
                opening between two harems, the masters of which made warning 
                noises, but did not attack him. We watched him travel slowly inland, 
                threading about among the harems along what must have been the 
                path. </p>
              <p>　　'Here goes,' I said, stepping out; but I confess my heart was 
                in my mouth as I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous 
                herd. </p>
              <p>　　'It would be wise to make the boat fast,' Maud said. </p>
              <p>　　She had stepped out beside me, and I regarded her with wonderment. 
              </p>
              <p>　　She nodded her head determinedly. 'Yes, I'm going with you, 
                so you may as well secure the boat and arm me with a club.' </p>
              <p>　　'Let's go back,' I said dejectedly. 'I think tundra grass will 
                do, after all.' </p>
              <p>　　'You know it won't,' was her reply. 'Shall I lead?' </p>
              <p>　　With a shrug of the shoulders, but with the warmest admiration 
                and pride at heart for this woman, I equipped her with the broken 
                oar and took another for myself. It was with nervous trepidation 
                that we made the first few rods of the journey. Once Maud screamed 
                in terror as a cow thrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot, 
                and several times I quickened my pace for the same reason. But, 
                beyond warning coughs from each side, there were no signs of hostility. 
                It was a rookery that had never been raided by the hunters, and 
                in consequence the seals were mild-tempered and at the same time 
                unafraid. </p>
              <p>　　In the very heart of the herd the din was terrific. It was 
                almost dizzying in its effect. I paused and smiled reassuringly 
                at Maud, for I had recovered my equanimity sooner than she. I 
                could see that she was still badly frightened. She came close 
                to me and shouted: </p>
              <p>　　'I'm dreadfully afraid!' </p>
              <p>　　And I was not. Though the novelty had not yet worn off, the 
                peaceful comportment of the seals had quieted my alarm. Maud was 
                trembling. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm afraid, and I'm not afraid,' she chattered, with shaking 
                jaws. 'It's my miserable body, not I.' </p>
              <p>　　'It's all right; it's all right,' I reassured her, my arm passing 
                instinctively and protectingly around her. </p>
              <p>　　I shall never forget, in that moment, how instantly conscious 
                I became of my manhood. The primitive deeps of my nature stirred. 
                I felt myself masculine, the protector of the weak, the fighting 
                male. And, best of all, I felt myself the protector of my loved 
                one. She leaned against me, so light and lily-frail, and as her 
                trembling eased away it seemed as though I became aware of prodigious 
                strength. I felt myself a match for the most ferocious bull in 
                the herd, and I know, had such a bull charged upon me, that I 
                would have met him unflinchingly and cooly, and I know that I 
                would have killed him. </p>
              <p>　　'I am all right now,' she said, looking up at me gratefully. 
                'Let us go on.' </p>
              <p>　　And that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence 
                filled me with an exultant joy. The youth of the race seemed burgeoning 
                in me, over-civilized man that I was, and I lived for myself the 
                old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten 
                ancestry. I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought 
                as we went along the path between the jostling harems. </p>
              <p>　　A quarter of a mile inland we came upon the holluschickie- 
                sleek bulls, living out the loneliness of their bacherlorhood 
                and gathering strength against the day when they would fight their 
                way into the ranks of the benedicts. </p>
              <p>　　Everything now went smoothly. I seemed to know just what to 
                do and how to do it. Shouting, making threatening gestures with 
                my club, and even prodding the lazy ones, I quickly cut out a 
                score of the young bachelors from their companions. Whenever one 
                made an attempt to break back toward the water, I headed him off. 
                Maud took an active part in the drive, and with her cries and 
                flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable assistance. 
                I noticed, though, that whenever one looked tired and lagged she 
                let him slip past. But I noticed, also, whenever one, with a show 
                of fight, tried to break past, that her eyes glinted and showed 
                bright and she rapped him smartly with her club. </p>
              <p>　　'My, it's exciting!' she cried, pausing from sheer weakness. 
                'I think I'll sit down.' </p>
              <p>　　I drove the little herd (a dozen strong, now, what of the escapes 
                she had permitted) a hundred yards farther on; and by the time 
                she joined me I had finished the slaughter and was beginning to 
                skin. An hour later went proudly back along the path between the 
                harems. And twice again we came down the path burdened with skins, 
                till I thought we had enough to roof the hut. I set the sail, 
                laid one tack out of the cove, and on the other tack made our 
                own little inner cove. </p>
              <p>　　'It's just like home-coming,' Maud said, as I ran the boat 
                ashore. </p>
              <p>　　I heard her words with a responsive thrill, it was all so dearly 
                intimate and natural, and I said: </p>
              <p>　　'It seems as though I have lived this life always. The world 
                of books and bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream-memory 
                than an actuality. I surely have hunted and forayed and fought 
                all the days of my life. And you, too, seem a part of it. You 
                are-' I was on the verge of saying, 'my woman, my mate,' but glibly 
                changed it to, 'standing the hardship well.' </p>
              <p>　　But her ear had caught the flaw. She recognized a flight that 
                midmost broke. She gave me a quick look. </p>
              <p>　　'Not that. You were saying-' </p>
              <p>　　'That you are living the life of a savage and living it quite 
                successfully,' I said easily. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh,' was all she replied; but I could have sworn there was 
                a note of disappointment in her voice. </p>
              <p>　　But 'my woman, my mate,' kept ringing in my head for the rest 
                of the day and for many days. Yet never did it ring more loudly 
                than the night, as I watched her draw back the blanket of moss 
                from the coals, blow up the fire, and cook the evening meal. It 
                must have been latent savagery stirring in me for the old words, 
                so bound up with the roots of the race, to grip me and thrill 
                me. And grip and thrill they did, till I fell asleep, murmuring 
                them to myself over and over again.</p>

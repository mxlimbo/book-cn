              <p>　　'IT'S TOO BAD THE GHOST HAS LOST her masts. Why, we could sail 
                away in her. Don't you think we could, Humphrey?' </p>
              <p>　　I sprang excitedly to my feet. </p>
              <p>　　'I wonder- I wonder,' I repeated, pacing up and down. </p>
              <p>　　Maud's eyes were shining with anticipation as they followed 
                me. She had such faith in me! And the thought of it was so much 
                added power. I remembered Michelet's: 'To man, woman is as the 
                earth was to her legendary son; he has but to fall down and kiss 
                her breast and he is strong again.' For the first time I knew 
                the wonderful truth of his words. Why, I was living them. Maud 
                was all this to me, an unfailing source of strength and courage. 
                I had but to look at her, or think of her, and be strong again. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It can be done- it can be done,' I was thinking and asserting 
                aloud. 'What men have done I can do, and if they have never done 
                this before, still I can do it.' </p>
              <p>　　'What, for goodness' sake?' Maud demanded. 'Do be merciful. 
                What is it you can do?' </p>
              <p>　　'We can do it,' I amended. 'Why, nothing else than put the 
                masts back into the Ghost and sail away.' </p>
              <p>　　'Humphrey!' she exclaimed. </p>
              <p>　　And I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already 
                a fact accomplished. </p>
              <p>　　'But how is it possibly to be done?' she asked. </p>
              <p>　　'I don't know,' was my answer. 'I know only that I am capable 
                of doing anything these days.' </p>
              <p>　　I smiled proudly at her- too proudly, for she dropped her eyes 
                and was for the moment silent. </p>
              <p>　　'But there is Captain Larsen,' she objected. </p>
              <p>　　'Blind and helpless,' I answered promptly, waving him aside 
                as a straw. </p>
              <p>　　'But those terrible hands of his! You know how he leaped across 
                the opening of the lazaret.' </p>
              <p>　　'And you know also how I crept about and avoided him,' I contended 
                gaily. </p>
              <p>　　'And lost your shoes.' </p>
              <p>　　'You'd hardly expect him to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet 
                inside of them.' </p>
              <p>　　We both laughed, and then went seriously to work constructing 
                the plan whereby we were to step the masts of the Ghost and return 
                to the world. I remembered hazily the physics of my schooldays, 
                while the last few months had given me practical experience with 
                mechanical purchases. I must say, though, when we walked down 
                to the Ghost to inspect more closely the task before us, that 
                the sight of the great masts lying in the water almost disheartened 
                me. Where were we to begin? If there had been one mast standing, 
                something high up to which to fasten blocks and tackles! But there 
                was nothing. It reminded me of the problem of lifting oneself 
                by one's bootstraps. I understood the mechanics of levers; but 
                where was I to get a fulcrum? </p>
              <p>　　There was the mainmast, fifteen inches in diameter at what 
                was now the butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, 
                I roughly calculated, at least three thousand pounds. And then 
                came the foremast, larger in diameter and weighing surely thirty-five 
                hundred pounds. Where was I to begin? Maud stood silently by my 
                side while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors 
                as 'shears.' But, though known to sailors, I invented it there 
                on Endeavor Island. By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars 
                and then elevating them in the air like an inverted V, I could 
                get a point above the deck to which to make fast my hoisting-tackle. 
                To this tackle I could, if necessary, attach a second tackle. 
                And then there was the windlass! </p>
              <p>　　Maud saw that I had achieved a solution, and her eyes warmed 
                sympathetically. </p>
              <p>　　'What are you going to do?' she asked. </p>
              <p>　　'Clear that raffle,' I answered, pointing to the tangled wreckage 
                overside. </p>
              <p>　　Ah, the decisiveness, the very sound of the words, was good 
                in my ears. 'Clear that raffle!' Imagine so salty a phrase on 
                the lips of the Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone! </p>
              <p>　　There must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose 
                and voice, for Maud smiled. Her appreciation of the ridiculous 
                was keen, and in all things she unerringly saw and felt, where 
                it existed, the touch of sham, the overshading, the overtone. 
                It was this which had given poise and penetration to her own work 
                and made her of worth to the world. The serious critic, with the 
                sense of humor and the power of expression, must inevitably command 
                the world's ear. And so it was that she had commanded. Her sense 
                of humor was really the artist's instinct for proportion. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm sure I've heard it before, somewhere, in books,' she murmured 
                gleefully. </p>
              <p>　　I had an instinct for proportion myself, and I collapsed forthwith, 
                descending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state 
                of humble confusion which was, to say the least, very miserable. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Her hand leaped out at once to mine. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm so sorry,' she said. </p>
              <p>　　'No need to be,' I gulped. 'It does me good. There's too much 
                of the schoolboy in me. All of which is neither here nor there. 
                What we've got to do is actually and literally to clear that raffle. 
                If you'll come with me in the boat, we'll get to work and straighten 
                things out.' </p>
              <p>　　'&quot;When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives 
                in their teeth,&quot;' she quoted at me; and for the rest of the 
                afternoon we made merry over our labor. </p>
              <p>　　Her task was to hold the boat in position while I worked at 
                the tangle. And such a tangle- halyards, sheets, guys, downhauls, 
                shrouds, stays, all washed about and back and forth and through 
                and twined and knitted by the sea. I cut no more than was necessary, 
                and what with passing the long ropes under and around the booms 
                and masts, of unreeving the halyards and sheets, of coiling down 
                in the boat and uncoiling in order to pass through another knot 
                in the bight, I was soon wet to the skin. </p>
              <p>　　The sails did require some cutting, and the canvas, heavy with 
                water, tried my strength severely; but I succeeded before nightfall 
                in getting it all spread out on the beach to dry. We were both 
                very tired when we knocked off for supper, and we had done good 
                work, too, though to the eye it appeared insignificant. </p>
              <p>　　Next morning, with Maud as able assistant, I went into the 
                hold of the Ghost to clear the steps of the mast-butts. We had 
                no more than begun work when the sound of my knocking and hammering 
                brought Wolf Larsen. </p>
              <p>　　'Hello, below!' he cried down the open hatch. </p>
              <p>　　The sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me, 
                as for protection, and she rested one hand on my arm while we 
                parleyed. </p>
              <p>　　'Hello, on deck!' I replied. 'Good morning to you.' </p>
              <p>　　'What are you doing down there?' he demanded. 'Trying to scuttle 
                my ship for me?' </p>
              <p>　　'Quite the opposite; I'm repairing her,' was my answer. </p>
              <p>　　'But what in thunder are you repairing?' There was puzzlement 
                in his voice. </p>
              <p>　　'Why, I'm getting everything ready for restepping the masts,' 
                I replied easily, as though it were the simplest project imaginable. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It seems as though you're standing on your own legs at last, 
                Hump,' we heard him say; and then for some time he was silent. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'But I say, Hump,' he called down, 'you can't do it.' </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, yes, I can,' I retorted. 'I'm doing it now.' </p>
              <p>　　'But this is my vessel, my particular property. What if I forbid 
                you?' </p>
              <p>　　'You forget,' I replied. 'You are no longer the biggest bit 
                of the ferment. You were once, and able to eat me, as you were 
                pleased to phrase it; but there has been a diminishing, and I 
                am now able to eat you. The yeast has grown stale.' </p>
              <p>　　He gave a short, disagreeable laugh. 'I see you're working 
                on my philosophy back on me for all it is worth. But don't make 
                the mistake of underestimating me. For your own good I warn you.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Since when have you become an altruist?' I queried. 'Confess, 
                now, in warning me for my own good, that you are very inconsistent.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　He ignored my sarcasm, saying, 'Suppose I clap the hatch on 
                now? You won't fool me as you did in the lazaret.' </p>
              <p>　　'Wolf Larsen,' I said sternly, for the first time addressing 
                him by this his most familiar name, 'I am unable to shoot a helpless, 
                unresisting man. You have proved that to my satisfaction as well 
                as yours. But I warn you now, and not so much for your own good 
                as for mine, that I shall shoot you the moment you attempt a hostile 
                act. I can shoot you now, as I stand here; and if you are so minded, 
                just go ahead and try to clap on the hatch.' </p>
              <p>　　'Nevertheless I forbid you; I distinctly forbid your tampering 
                with my ship.' </p>
              <p>　　'But, man!' I expostulated. 'You advance the fact that it is 
                your ship as though it were a moral right. You have never considered 
                moral rights in your dealings with others. You surely do not dream 
                that I'll consider them in dealing with you?' </p>
              <p>　　I had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could 
                see him. The lack of expression on his face, so different from 
                when I had watched him unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, 
                staring eyes. It was not a pleasant face to look upon. </p>
              <p>　　'And none so poor, not even Hump, to do him reverence,' he 
                sneered. </p>
              <p>　　The sneer was wholly in his voice. His face remained expressionless 
                as ever. </p>
              <p>　　'How do you do, Miss Brewster?' he said suddenly, after a pause. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I started. She had made no noise whatever, had not even moved. 
                Could it be that some glimmer of vision remained to him? Or that 
                his vision was coming back? </p>
              <p>　　'How do you do, Captain Larsen?' she answered. 'Pray how did 
                you know I was here?' </p>
              <p>　　'Heard you breathing, of course. I say, Hump's improving; don't 
                you think so?' </p>
              <p>　　'I don't know,' she answered, smiling at me. 'I have never 
                seen him otherwise.' </p>
              <p>　　'You should have seen him before, then.' </p>
              <p>　　'Wolf Larsen in large doses,' I murmured, 'before and after 
                taking.' </p>
              <p>　　'I want to tell you again, Hump,' he said threateningly, 'that 
                you'd better leave things alone.' </p>
              <p>　　'But don't you care to escape as well as we?' I asked incredulously. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'No,' was his answer. 'I intend dying here.' </p>
              <p>　　'Well, we don't,' I concluded defiantly, beginning again my 
                knocking and hammering.</p>

              <p>　　I CANNOT SAY THAT THE POSITION Of mate carried with it anything 
                more joyful than that there were no more dishes to wash. I was 
                ignorant of the simplest duties of mate, and would have fared 
                badly indeed had not the sailors sympathized with me. I knew nothing 
                of the minutiae of ropes and rigging, of the trimming and setting 
                of sails; but the sailors took pains to put me to rights, Louis 
                proving a specially good teacher, and I had little trouble with 
                those under me. </p>
              <p>　　With the hunters it was otherwise. Familiar in varying degree 
                with the sea, they took me as a sort of joke. In truth, it was 
                a joke to me that I, the veriest landsman, should be filling the 
                office of mate; but to be taken as a joke by others was a different 
                matter. I made no complaint, but Wolf Larsen demanded the must 
                punctilious sea-etiquette in my case,- far more than poor Johansen 
                had ever received,- and at the expense of several rows, threats, 
                and much grumbling, he brought the hunters to time. I was 'Mr. 
                Van Weyden' fore and aft, and only Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed 
                me as 'Hump.' </p>
              <p>　　It was amusing. Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while 
                we were at dinner, and as I left the table he would say, 'Mr. 
                Van Weyden, will you kindly put about on the port tack?' And I 
                would go on deck, beckon Louis to me, and learn from him what 
                was to be done. Then, a few minutes later, having digested his 
                instructions and thoroughly mastered the maneuver, I would proceed 
                to issue my orders. I remember an early instance of this kind, 
                when Wolf Larsen appeared on the scene just as I had begun to 
                give orders. He smoked his cigar and looked on quietly till the 
                thing was done, and then paced aft by my side along the weather 
                poop. </p>
              <p>　　'Hump,' he said,- 'I beg pardon, Mr. Van Weyden,- I congratulate 
                you. I think you can now fire your father's legs back into the 
                grave to him. You've discovered your own, and learned to stand 
                on them. A little rope-work, sail-making, and experience with 
                storms and such things, and by the end of the voyage you could 
                ship on any coasting schooner.' </p>
              <p>　　It was during this period, between the death of Johansen and 
                the arrival on the sealing-grounds, that I passed my pleasantest 
                hours on the Ghost. Wolf Larsen was considerate, the sailors helped 
                me, and I was no longer in irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge. 
                And I make free to say, as the days went by, that I found I was 
                taking a certain secret pride in myself. Fantastic as the situation 
                was,- a landlubber second in command,- I was nevertheless carrying 
                it off well; and during that brief time I was proud of myself, 
                and I grew to love the heave and roll of the Ghost under my feet 
                as she wallowed north and west through the tropic sea to the islet 
                where we filled our water-casks. </p>
              <p>　　But my happiness was not unalloyed. It was comparative, a period 
                of less misery slipped in between a past of great miseries and 
                a future of great miseries. For the Ghost, so far as the seamen 
                were concerned, was a hell-ship of the worst description. They 
                never had a moment's rest or peace. Wolf Larsen treasured against 
                them the attempt on his life and the drubbing he had received 
                in the forecastle, and morning, noon, and night, and all night 
                as well, he devoted himself to making life unlivable for them. 
              </p>
              <p>　　He knew well the psychology of the little thing, and it was 
                the little things by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge 
                of madness. I have seen Harrison called from his bunk to put properly 
                away a misplaced paint-brush, and the two watches below haled 
                from their tired sleep to accompany him and see him do it. A little 
                thing, truly, but when multiplied by the thousand ingenious devices 
                of such a mind, the mental state of the men in the forecastle 
                may be slightly comprehended. </p>
              <p>　　Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were 
                continually occurring. Blows were struck, and there were always 
                two or three men nursing injuries at the hands of the human beast 
                who was their master. Concerted action was impossible in face 
                of the heavy arsenal of weapons carried in the steerage and cabin. 
                Leach and Johnson were the two particular victims of Wolf Larsen's 
                diabolic temper, and the look of profound melancholy which had 
                settled on Johnson's face and in his eyes made my heart bleed. 
              </p>
              <p>　　With Leach it was different. There was too much of the fighting 
                beast in him. He seemed possessed by an insatiable fury which 
                gave no time for grief. His lips had become distorted into a permanent 
                snarl, which, at mere sight of Wolf Larsen, broke out in sound, 
                horrible and menacing, and, I do believe, unconsciously. I have 
                seen him follow Wolf Larsen about with his eyes, like an animal 
                its keeper, the while the animal-like snarl sounded deep in his 
                throat and vibrated forth between his teeth. </p>
              <p>　　I remember once, on deck, in bright day, touching him on the 
                shoulder as preliminary to giving an order. His back was toward 
                me, and at the first feel of my hand he leaped upright in the 
                air and away from me, snarling and turning his head as he leaped. 
                He had for the moment mistaken me for the man he hated. </p>
              <p>　　Both he and Johnson would have killed Wolf Larsen at the slightest 
                opportunity, but the opportunity never came. Wolf Larsen was too 
                wise for that, and, besides, they had no adequate weapons. With 
                their fists alone they had no chance whatever. Time and again 
                he fought it out with Leach, who fought back always, like a wildcat, 
                tooth and nail and fist, until stretched exhausted or unconscious 
                on the deck. And he was never averse to another encounter. All 
                the devil that was in him challenged the devil in Wolf Larsen. 
                They had but to appear on deck at the same time, when they would 
                be at it, cursing, snarling, striking; and I have seen Leach fling 
                himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation. Once 
                he threw his heavy sheath-knife, missing Wolf Larsen's throat 
                by an inch. Another time he dropped a steel marlinespike from 
                the main-crosstree. It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling 
                ship, but the sharp point of the spike, whistling seventy-five 
                feet through the air, barely missed Wolf Larsen's head as he emerged 
                from the cabin companionway, and drove its length two inches and 
                over into the solid deck-planking. Still another time he stole 
                into the steerage, possessed himself of a loaded shotgun, and 
                was making a rush for the deck with it when caught by Kerfoot 
                and disarmed. </p>
              <p>　　I often wondered why Wolf Larsen did not kill him and make 
                an end of it. But he only laughed and seemed to enjoy it. There 
                seemed a certain spice about it, such as men must feel who take 
                delight in making pets of ferocious animals. </p>
              <p>　　'It gives a thrill to life,' he explained to me, 'when life 
                is carried in one's hand. Man is a natural gambler, and life is 
                the biggest stake he can lay. The greater the odds, the greater 
                the thrill. Why should I deny myself the joy of exciting Leach's 
                soul to fever-pitch? For that matter, I do him a kindness. The 
                greatness of sensation is mutual. He is living more royally than 
                any man for'ard, though he does not know it. For he has what they 
                have not- purpose, something to do and be done, an all-absorbing 
                end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope that 
                he may kill me. Really, Hump, he is living deep and high. I doubt 
                that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly 
                envy him, sometimes, when I see him raging at the summit of passion 
                and sensibility.' </p>
              <p>　　'Ah, but it is cowardly, cowardly,' I cried. 'You have all 
                the advantage.' </p>
              <p>　　'Of the two of us, you and I, who is the greater coward?' he 
                asked seriously. 'If the situation is unpleasing, you compromise 
                with your conscience when you make yourself a party to it. If 
                you were really great, really true to yourself, you would join 
                forces with Leach and Johnson. But you are afraid, you are afraid. 
                You want to live. The life that is in you cries out that it must 
                live, no matter what the cost; so you live ignominiously, untrue 
                to the best you dream of, sinning against your whole pitiful little 
                code, and, if there were a hell, heading your soul straight for 
                it. Bah! I play the braver part. I do no sin, for I am true to 
                the promptings of the life that is in me. I am sincere with my 
                soul at least, and that is what you are not.' </p>
              <p>　　There was a sting in what he said. Perhaps, after all, I was 
                playing a cowardly part. And the more I thought about it the more 
                it appeared that my duty to myself lay in doing what he had advised, 
                lay in joining forces with Johnson and Leach and working for his 
                death. Right here, I think, entered the austere conscience of 
                my Puritan ancestry, impelling me toward lurid deeds and sanctioning 
                even murder as right conduct. I dwelt upon the idea. It would 
                be a most moral act to rid the world of such a monster. Humanity 
                would be better and happier for it, life fairer and sweeter. </p>
              <p>　　I pondered it long, lying sleepless in my bunk and reviewing 
                in endless procession the facts of the situation. I talked with 
                Johnson and Leach during the night watches when Wolf Larsen was 
                below. But both men had lost hope, Johnson because of temperamental 
                despondency, Leach because he had beaten himself out in the vain 
                struggle and was exhausted. But he caught my hand in a passionate 
                grip one night, saying: </p>
              <p>　　'I think ye're square, Mr. Van Weyden. But stay where you are 
                an' keep yer mouth shut. Say nothin', but saw wood. We're dead 
                men, I know it; but, all the same, you might be able to do us 
                a favor sometime when we need it damn bad.' </p>
              <p>　　It was only next day, when Wainwright Island loomed to windward, 
                close abeam, that Wolf Larsen opened his mouth in prophecy. He 
                had attacked Johnson, been attacked by Leach, and had just finished 
                whipping the pair of them. </p>
              <p>　　'Leach,' he said, 'you know I'm going to kill you sometime 
                or other, don't you?' </p>
              <p>　　A snarl was the answer. </p>
              <p>　　'And as for you, Johnson, you'll get so tired of life before 
                I'm through with you that you'll fling yourself over the side. 
                See if you don't.' </p>
              <p>　　'That's suggestion,' he added, in an aside to me. 'I'll bet 
                you a month's pay he acts upon it.' </p>
              <p>　　I had cherished a hope that his victims would find an opportunity 
                to escape while filling our water-barrels, but Wolf Larsen had 
                selected his spot well. The Ghost lay half a mile beyond the surf-line 
                of a lonely beach. Here debouched a deep gorge, with precipitous, 
                volcanic walls which no man could scale. And here, under his direct 
                supervision,- for he went ashore himself,- Leach and Johnson filled 
                the small casks and rolled them down to the beach. They had no 
                chance to make a break for liberty in one of the boats. </p>
              <p>　　Harrison and Kelly, however, made such an attempt. They composed 
                the crew of one of the boats, and their task was to play between 
                the schooner and the shore, carrying a single cask each trip. 
                Just before dinner, starting for the beach with an empty barrel, 
                they altered their course and bore away to the left to round the 
                promontory which jutted into the sea between them and liberty. 
                Beyond its foaming base lay the pretty villages of the Japanese 
                colonists and smiling valleys which penetrated deep into the interior. 
                Once in the fastnesses they promised, and the two men could defy 
                Wolf Larsen. </p>
              <p>　　I had observed Henderson and Smoke loitering about the deck 
                all morning, and I now learned why they were there. Procuring 
                their rifles, they opened fire in a leisurely manner upon the 
                deserters. It was a most cold-blooded exhibition of marksmanship. 
                At first their bullets zipped harmlessly along the surface of 
                the water on each side the boat; but, as the men continued to 
                pull lustily, they struck closer and closer. </p>
              <p>　　'Now watch me take Kelly's right oar,' Smoke said, drawing 
                a more careful aim. </p>
              <p>　　I was looking through the glasses, and I saw the oar-blade 
                shattered as he shot. Henderson duplicated his feat, selecting 
                Harrison's right oar. The boat slued around. The two remaining 
                oars were quickly broken. The men tried to row with the spinters, 
                and had them shot out of their hands. Kelly ripped up a bottom-board 
                and began paddling, but dropped it with a cry of pain as its splinters 
                drove into his hands. Then they gave up, letting the boat drift 
                till a second boat, sent from the shore by Wolf Larsen, took them 
                in tow and brought them aboard. </p>
              <p>　　Late that afternoon we hove up anchor and got away. Nothing 
                was before us but the three or four months' hunting on the sealing-grounds. 
                The outlook was black indeed, and I went about my work with a 
                heavy heart. An almost funereal gloom seemed to have descended 
                upon the Ghost. Wolf Larsen had taken to his bunk with one of 
                his strange splitting headaches. Harrison stood listlessly at 
                the wheel, half supporting himself by it, as though wearied by 
                the weight of his flesh. The rest of the men were morose and silent. 
                I came upon Kelly crouching in the lee of the forecastle scuttle, 
                his head on his knees, his arms about his head, in an attitude 
                of unutterable despondency. </p>
              <p>　　Johnson I found lying full-length on the forecastle head, staring 
                at the troubled churn of the forefoot, and I remembered with horror 
                the suggestion Wolf Larsen had made. It seemed likely to bear 
                fruit. I tried to break in on the man's morbid thoughts by calling 
                him away; but he smiled sadly at me, and refused to obey. </p>
              <p>　　Leach approached me as I returned aft. </p>
              <p>　　'I want to ask a favor, Mr. Van Weyden,' he said. 'If it's 
                yer luck to ever make 'Frisco once more, will you hunt up Matt 
                McCarthy? He's my old man. He lives on the Hill, back of the Mayfair 
                bakery, runnin' a cobbler's shop that everybody knows, an' you'll 
                have no trouble. Tell him I lived to be sorry for the trouble 
                I brought him an' the things I done, an'- an' just tell him &quot;God 
                bless him,&quot; for me.' </p>
              <p>　　I nodded my head, but said: </p>
              <p>　　'We'll all win back to San Francisco, Leach, and you'll be 
                with me when I go to see Matt McCarthy.' </p>
              <p>　　'I'd like to believe you,' he answered, shaking my hand, 'but 
                I can't. Wolf Larsen'll do for me, I know it, and all I can hope 
                is he'll do it quick.' </p>
              <p>　　And as he left me I was aware of the same desire at my heart. 
                Since it was to be done, let it be done with despatch. The general 
                gloom had gathered me into its folds. The worst appeared inevitable; 
                and as I paced the deck hour after hour, I found myself afflicted 
                with Wolf Larsen's repulsive ideas. What was it all about? Where 
                was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction 
                of human souls? It was a cheap and sordid thing, after all, this 
                life, and the sooner over the better. Over and done with! Over 
                and done with! I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly 
                into the sea, with the certitude that sooner or later I should 
                be sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.

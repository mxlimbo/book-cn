              <p>　　NEXT DAY, THE MAST-STEPS clear and everything in readiness, 
                we started to get the two topmasts aboard. The maintopmast was 
                over thirty feet in length, the foretopmast nearly thirty, and 
                it was of these that I intended making the shears. It was puzzling 
                work. Fastening one end of a heavy tackle to the windlass, and 
                with the other end fast to the butt of the foretopmast, I began 
                to heave. Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down the 
                slack. </p>
              <p>　　We were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted. 
                It was an improved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was 
                enormous. Of course, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; 
                as many times as it doubled my strength, that many times was doubled 
                the length of rope I heaved in. The tackle dragged heavily across 
                the rail, increasing its drag as the spar arose more and more 
                out of the water, and the exertion on the windlass grew severe. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail everything 
                came to a standstill. </p>
              <p>　　'I might have known it,' I said impatiently. 'Now we have to 
                do it all over again.' </p>
              <p>　　'Why not fasten the tackle partway down the mast?' Maud suggested. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It's what I should have done at first,' I answered, hugely 
                disgusted with myself. </p>
              <p>　　Slipping off a turn, I lowered the mast back into the water 
                and fastened the tackle a third of the way down from the butt. 
                In an hour, what of this and of rests between the heaving, I had 
                hoisted it to the point where I could hoist no more. Eight feet 
                of the butt was above the rail, and I was as far away as ever 
                from getting the spar on board. I sat down and pondered the problem. 
                It did not take long. I sprang jubilantly to my feet. </p>
              <p>　　'Now I have it!' I cried. 'I ought to make the tackle fast 
                at the point of balance. And what we learn of this will serve 
                us with everything else we have to hoist aboard.' </p>
              <p>　　Once again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the 
                water. But I miscalculated the point of balance, so that when 
                I heaved, the top of the mast came up instead of the butt. Maud 
                looked despair, but I laughed and said it would do just as well. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Instructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack 
                away at command, I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried 
                to balance it inboard across the rail. When I thought I had it 
                I cried to her to slack away; but the spar righted, despite my 
                efforts, and dropped back toward the water. Again I heaved it 
                up to its old position, for I had now another idea. I remembered 
                the watch-tackle,- a small double-and single-block affair, and 
                fetched it. </p>
              <p>　　While I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the 
                opposite rail, Wolf Larsen came on the scene. We exchanged nothing 
                more than good mornings, and though he could not see, he sat on 
                the rail out of the way and followed by the sound all that I did. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Again instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I 
                gave the word, I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle. Slowly 
                the mast swung in until it balanced at right angles across the 
                rail; and then I discovered, to my amazement, that there was no 
                need for Maud to slack away. In fact, the very opposite was necessary. 
                Making the watch-tackle fast, I hove on the windlass and brought 
                in the mast, inch by inch, till its top tilted down to the deck 
                and finally its whole length lay on the deck. </p>
              <p>　　I looked at my watch. It was twelve o'clock. My back was aching 
                sorely, and I felt extremely tired and hungry. And there on the 
                deck was a single stick of timber to show for a whole morning's 
                work. For the first time I thoroughly realized the extent of the 
                task before us. But I was learning, I was learning. The afternoon 
                would show far more accomplished. And it did; for we returned 
                at one o'clock, rested, and strengthened by a hearty dinner. </p>
              <p>　　In less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was 
                constructing the shears. Lashing the two topmasts together, and 
                making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection 
                I attached the double block of the mainthroat-halyards. This, 
                with the single block and throat-halyards themselves, gave me 
                a hoisting-tackle. To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping 
                on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats. Everything in readiness, 
                I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly 
                to the windlass. I was growing to have faith in that windlass, 
                for it gave me power beyond all expectation. As usual, Maud held 
                the turn while I heaved. The shears rose in the air. </p>
              <p>　　Then I discovered I had forgotten guyropes. This necessitated 
                my climbing the shears, which I did twice before I finished guying 
                it fore and aft and to each side. Twilight had set in by the time 
                this was accomplished. Wolf Larsen, who had sat about and listened 
                all afternoon and never opened his mouth, had taken himself off 
                to the galley and started his supper. I felt quite stiff across 
                the small of the back, so much so that I straightened up with 
                an effort and with pain. I looked proudly at my work. It was beginning 
                to show. I was wild with desire, like a child with a new toy, 
                to hoist something with my shears. </p>
              <p>　　'I wish it weren't so late,' I said. 'I'd like to see how it 
                works.' </p>
              <p>　　'Don't be a glutton, Humphrey,' Maud chided me. 'Remember, 
                tomorrow is coming, and you're so tired now that you can hardly 
                stand.' </p>
              <p>　　'And you?' I said, with sudden solicitude. 'You must be very 
                tired. You have worked hard and nobly. I am proud of you, Maud.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Not half so proud as I am of you, nor with half the reason,' 
                she answered, looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with 
                an expression in her own and a dancing, tremulous light which 
                I had not seen before and which gave me a pang of quick delight. 
                I knew not why, for I did not understand it. Then she dropped 
                her eyes, to lift them again, laughing. </p>
              <p>　　'If our friends could see us now!' she said. 'Look at us. Have 
                you ever paused for a moment to consider our appearance?' </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, I have considered yours frequently,' I answered, puzzled 
                over what I had seen in her eyes and by her sudden change of subject. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Mercy!' she cried. 'And what do I look like, pray?' </p>
              <p>　　'A scarecrow, I'm afraid,' I replied. 'Just glance at your 
                draggled skirts, for instance. Look at those three-cornered tears. 
                And such a waist! It would not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce 
                that you have been cooking over a campfire, to say nothing of 
                trying out seal-blubber. And, to cap it all, that cap! And all 
                that is the woman who wrote &quot;A Kiss Endured.&quot;' </p>
              <p>　　She made me an elaborate and stately curtsy, and said, 'As 
                for you, sir-' </p>
              <p>　　And yet, through the five minutes of banter which followed, 
                there was a serious something underneath the fun which I could 
                not but relate to the strange and fleeting expression I had caught 
                in her eyes. What was it? Could it be that our eyes were speaking 
                beyond the will of our speech? My eyes had spoken, I knew, until 
                I had found the culprits out and silenced them. This had occurred 
                several times. But had she seen the clamor in them and understood? 
                And had her eyes so spoken to me? What else could that expression 
                have meant?- that dancing, tremulous light and a something more 
                which words could not describe. And yet it could not be. It was 
                impossible. Besides, I was not skilled in the speech of eyes. 
                I was only Humphrey Van Weyden, a bookish fellow who loved. And 
                to love, and to wait and win love, that surely was glorious enough 
                for me. And thus I thought, even as we chaffed each other, until 
                we arrived ashore and there were other things to think about. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'It's a shame, after working hard all day, that we cannot have 
                an uninterrupted night's sleep,' I complained, after supper. </p>
              <p>　　'But there can be no danger now, from a blind man?' she queried. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I shall never be able to trust him,' I averred; 'and far less 
                now that he is blind. The liability is that his part-helplessness 
                will make him more malignant than ever. I know what I shall do 
                tomorrow, the first thing- run out a light anchor and kedge the 
                schooner off the beach. And each night when we come ashore in 
                the boat, Mr. Wolf Larsen will be left, virtually a prisoner, 
                on board. So this will be the last night we have to stand watch, 
                and because of that it will go the easier.' </p>
              <p>　　We were awake early, and just finishing breakfast as daylight 
                came. </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, Humphrey!' I heard Maud cry in dismay, and suddenly stop. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I looked at her. She was gazing at the Ghost. I followed her 
                gaze, but could see nothing unusual. She looked at me, and I looked 
                inquiry back. </p>
              <p>　　'The shears,' she said, and her voice trembled. </p>
              <p>　　I had forgotten their existence. I looked again, but could 
                not see them. </p>
              <p>　　'If he has-' I muttered savagely. </p>
              <p>　　She put her hand sympathetically on mine, and said, 'You will 
                have to begin over again.' </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, believe me, my anger means nothing; I could not hurt a 
                fly,' I smiled back bitterly. 'And the worst of it is, he knows 
                it. You are right. If he has destroyed the shears, I shall do 
                nothing except begin over again.' </p>
              <p>　　'But I'll stand my watch on board hereafter,' I blurted out 
                a moment later. 'And if he interferes-' </p>
              <p>　　'But I dare not stay ashore, all night, alone,' Maud was saying 
                when I came back to myself. 'It would be so much nicer if he would 
                be friendly with us and help us. We could all live comfortably 
                aboard.' </p>
              <p>　　'We will,' I asserted, still savagely, for the destruction 
                of my beloved shears had hit me hard. 'That is, you and I will 
                live aboard, friendly or not with Wolf Larsen.' </p>
              <p>　　'It's childish,' I laughed, later, 'for him to do such things, 
                and for me to grow angry over them, for that matter.' </p>
              <p>　　But my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at 
                the havoc he had done. The shears were gone altogether. The guys 
                had been slashed right and left. The throat-halyards which I had 
                rigged were cut across through every part- and he knew I could 
                not splice. A thought struck me: I ran to the windlass. It would 
                not work! He had broken it. We looked at each other in consternation. 
                Then I ran to the side. The masts, booms, and gaffs I had cleared 
                were gone. He had found the line which held them and cast it adrift. 
              </p>
              <p>　　Tears were in Maud's eyes, and I do believe they were for me. 
                I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting 
                the Ghost? He had done his work well. I sat down on the hatch-combing 
                and rested my chin on my hands in black despair. </p>
              <p>　　'He deserves to die,' I cried out; 'and- God forgive me- I 
                am not man enough to be his executioner.' </p>
              <p>　　But Maud was by my side, passing her hand soothingly through 
                my hair as though I were a child, and saying, 'There, there; it 
                will all come right. We are in the right and it must come right.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I remembered Michelet, and leaned my head against her; and 
                truly I became strong again. The blessed woman was an unfailing 
                fount of power to me. What did it matter? Only a setback, a delay. 
                The tide could not have carried the masts far to seaward, and 
                there had been no wind. It meant merely more work to find them 
                and tow them back. And, besides, it was a lesson. I knew what 
                to expect. He might have waited and destroyed our work more effectually 
                when we had more accomplished. </p>
              <p>　　'Here he comes now,' she whispered. </p>
              <p>　　I glanced up. He was strolling leisurely along the poop on 
                the port side. </p>
              <p>　　'Take no notice of him,' I whispered. 'He's coming to see how 
                we take it. Don't let him know that we know. We can deny him that 
                satisfaction. Take off your shoes- that's right- and carry them 
                in your hand.' </p>
              <p>　　And then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man. As he 
                came up the port side we slipped past on the starboard; and from 
                the poop we watched him turn and start aft on our track. </p>
              <p>　　He must have known, somehow, that we were on board, for he 
                said 'Good morning' very confidently, and waited for the greeting 
                to be returned. Then he strolled aft, and we slipped for'ard. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Oh, I know you're aboard,' he called out, and I could see 
                him listen intently after he had spoken. </p>
              <p>　　It reminded me of the great hoot-owl, listening, after its 
                booming cry, for the stir of its frightened prey. But we did not 
                stir, and we moved only when he moved. And so we dodged about 
                the deck, hand in hand, like a couple of children chased by a 
                wicked ogre, till Wolf Larsen, evidently in disgust, left the 
                deck for the cabin. There was glee in our eyes, and suppressed 
                titters in our mouths, as we put on our shoes and clambered over 
                the side into the boat. And as I looked into Maud's clear brown 
                eyes I forgot the evil he had done, and I knew only that I loved 
                her and that because of her the strength was mine to win our way 
                back to the world. </p>

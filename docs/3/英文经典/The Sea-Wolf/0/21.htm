<p>　　THE CHAGRIN WOLF LARSEN felt from being ignored by Maud Brewster 
                and me in the conversation at table had to express itself in some 
                fashion, and it fell to Thomas Mugridge to be the victim. He had 
                not mended his ways or his shirt, though the latter he contended 
                he had changed. The garment itself did not bear out the assertion, 
                nor did the accumulations of grease on stove and pot and pan attest 
                a general cleanliness. </p>
              <p>　　'I've given you warning, Cooky,' Wolf Larsen said, 'and now 
                you've got to take your medicine.' </p>
              <p>　　Mugridge's face turned white under its sooty veneer, and when 
                Wolf Larsen called for a rope and a couple of men, the miserable 
                Cockney fled wildly out of the galley and dodged and ducked about 
                the deck, with the grinning crew in pursuit. Few things could 
                have been more to their liking than to give him a tow over the 
                side, for to the forecastle he had sent messages and concoctions 
                of the vilest order. Conditions favored the undertaking. The Ghost 
                was slipping through the water at no more than three miles an 
                hour, and the sea was fairly calm. But Mugridge had little stomach 
                for a dip in it. Possibly he had seen men towed before. Besides, 
                the water was frightfully cold, and his was anything but a rugged 
                constitution. </p>
              <p>　　As usual, the watches below and the hunters turned out for 
                what promised sport. Mugridge seemed to be in rabid fear of the 
                water, and he exhibited a nimbleness and speed we did not dream 
                he possessed. Cornered in the right angle of the poop and galley, 
                he sprang like a cat to the top of the cabin and ran aft. But 
                his pursuers forestalling him, he doubled back across the cabin, 
                passed over the galley, and gained the deck by means of the steerage 
                scuttle. Straight forward he raced, the boat-puller Harrison at 
                his heels and gaining on him. But Mugridge, leaping suddenly, 
                caught the jib-boom-lift. It happened in an instant. Holding his 
                weight by his arms and in mid-air doubling his body at the hips, 
                he let fly with both feet. The oncoming Harrison caught the kick 
                squarely in the pit of the stomach, groaned involuntarily, and 
                doubled up and backward to the deck. </p>
              <p>　　Hand-clapping and roars of laughter from the hunters greeted 
                the exploit while Mugridge, eluding half of his pursuers at the 
                foremast, ran aft and through the remainder like a runner on the 
                football field. Straight aft he held to the poop, and along the 
                poop to the stern. So great was his speed that as he curved past 
                the corner of the cabin he slipped and fell. Nilson was standing 
                at the wheel, and the Cockney's hurling body struck his legs. 
                Both went down together, but Mugridge alone arose. By some freak 
                of pressures, his frail body had snapped the strong man's leg 
                like a pipe-stem. </p>
              <p>　　Parsons took the wheel, and the pursuit continued. Round and 
                round the decks they went, Mugridge sick with fear, the sailors 
                hallooing and shouting directions to one another, and the hunters 
                bellowing encouragement and laughter. Mugridge went down on the 
                fore-hatch, under three men; but he emerged from the mass like 
                an eel, bleeding at the mouth, the offending shirt ripped into 
                tatters, and sprang for the main-rigging. Up he went, clear up, 
                beyond the ratlines, to the very masthead. </p>
              <p>　　Half a dozen sailors swarmed to the crosstrees after him, where 
                they clustered and waited while two of their number, Oofty-Oofty 
                and Black (who was Latimer's boat-steerer), continued up the thin 
                steel stays, lifting their bodies higher and higher by means of 
                their arms. </p>
              <p>　　It was a perilous undertaking, for, at a height of over a hundred 
                feet from the deck, holding on by their hands, they were not in 
                the best of positions to protect themselves from Mugridge's feet. 
                And Mugridge kicked savagely, till the Kanaka, hanging on with 
                one hand, seized the Cockney's foot with the other. Black duplicated 
                the performance a moment later with the other foot. Then the three 
                writhed together in a swaying tangle, struggling, sliding, and 
                falling into the arms of their mates on the crosstrees. </p>
              <p>　　The aerial battle was over, and Thomas Mugridge, whining and 
                gibbering, was brought down to the deck. Wolf Larsen rove a bowline 
                in a piece of rope and slipped it under his shoulders. Then he 
                was carried aft and flung into the sea. Forty- fifty- sixty feet 
                of line ran out, when Wolf Larsen cried, 'Belay!' Oofty-Oofty 
                took a turn on a bitt, the rope tautened, and the Ghost, lunging 
                onward, jerked the cook to the surface. </p>
              <p>　　It was a pitiful spectacle. Though he could not drown, and 
                was nine-lived in addition, he was suffering all the agonies of 
                half-drowning. The Ghost was going very slowly, and when her stern 
                lifted on a wave and she slipped forward, she pulled the wretch 
                to the surface and gave him a moment in which to breathe; but 
                after each lift the stern fell, and while the bow lazily climbed 
                the next wave the line slackened and he sank beneath. </p>
              <p>　　I had forgotten the existence of Maud Brewster, and I remembered 
                her with a start as she stepped lightly beside me. It was her 
                first time on deck since she had come aboard. A dead silence greeted 
                her appearance. </p>
              <p>　　'What is the cause of the merriment?' she asked. </p>
              <p>　　'Ask Captain Larsen,' I answered composedly and coldly, though 
                inwardly my blood was boiling at the thought that she should be 
                witness to such brutality. </p>
              <p>　　She took my advice and was turning to put it into execution 
                when her eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty, immediately before her, 
                his body instinct with alertness and grace as he held the turn 
                of the rope. </p>
              <p>　　'Are you fishing?' she asked him. </p>
              <p>　　He made no reply. His eyes, fixed intently on the sea astern, 
                suddenly flashed. </p>
              <p>　　'Shark, ho, sir!' he cried. </p>
              <p>　　'Heave in! Lively! All hands tail on!' Wolf Larsen shouted, 
                springing himself to the rope in advance of the quickest. </p>
              <p>　　Mugridge had heard the Kanaka's warning cry and was screaming 
                madly. I could see a black fin cutting the water and making for 
                him with greater swiftness than he was being pulled aboard. It 
                was an even toss whether the shark or we would get him, and it 
                was a matter of moments. When Mugridge was directly beneath us, 
                the stern descended the slope of a passing wave, thus giving the 
                advantage to the shark. The fin disappeared. The belly flashed 
                white in a swift upward rush. Almost equally swift, but not quite, 
                was Wolf Larsen. He threw his strength into one tremendous jerk. 
                The Cockney's body left the water, so did part of the shark's. 
                He drew up his legs, and the man-eater seemed no more than barely 
                to touch one foot, sinking back into the water with a splash. 
                But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out. Then he 
                came in like a fresh-caught fish on a line, clearing the rail 
                generously and striking the deck in a heap, on hands and knees, 
                and rolling over. The right foot was missing, amputated neatly 
                at the ankle! </p>
              <p>　　I looked instantly at Maud Brewster. Her face was white, her 
                eyes dilated with horror. She was gazing, not at Thomas Mugridge, 
                but at Wolf Larsen. And he was aware of it, for he said, with 
                one of his short laughs: </p>
              <p>　　'Man-play, Miss Brewster. Somewhat rougher, I warrant, than 
                that you have been used to, but still man-play. The shark was 
                not in the reckoning. It-' </p>
              <p>　　But at this juncture, Mugridge, who had lifted his head and 
                ascertained the extent of his loss, floundered over on the deck 
                and buried his teeth in Wolf Larsen's leg. Wolf Larsen stooped, 
                coolly, to the Cockney, and pressed with thumb and finger at the 
                rear of the jaws and below the ears. The jaws opened with reluctance, 
                and Wolf Larsen stepped free. </p>
              <p>　　'As I was saying,' went on, as though nothing unwonted had 
                happened, 'the shark was not in the reckoning. It was- ahem- shall 
                we say Providence?' </p>
              <p>　　She gave no sign that she had heard, though the expression 
                of her eyes changed to one of inexpressible loathing as she started 
                to turn away. She no more than started, for she swayed and tottered, 
                and reached her hand weakly out to mine. I caught her in time 
                to save her from falling, and helped her to a seat on the cabin. 
                I thought she must faint outright, but she controlled herself. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Will you get a tourniquet, Mr. Van Weyden?' Wolf Larsen called 
                to me. </p>
              <p>　　I hesitated. Her lips moved, and though they formed no words, 
                she commanded me with her eyes, plainly as speech, to go to the 
                help of the unfortunate man. 'Please,' she managed to whisper, 
                and I could but obey. </p>
              <p>　　By now I had developed such skill at surgery that Wolf Larsen, 
                beyond several words of advice, left me to my task with a couple 
                of sailors for assistants. For his task he elected a vengeance 
                on the shark. </p>
              <p>　　A heavy swivel-hook, baited with fat salt pork, was dropped 
                overside; and by the time I had compressed the severed veins and 
                arteries the sailors were singing and heaving in the offending 
                monster. I did not see it myself, but my assistants, first one 
                and then the other, deserted me for a few moments to run amidships 
                and look at what was going on. The shark, a sixteen-footer, was 
                hoisted up against the main-rigging. Its jaws were pried apart 
                to their greatest extension, and a stout stake, sharpened at both 
                ends, was so inserted that when the pries were removed the spread 
                jaws were fixed upon it. This accomplished, the hook was cut out. 
                The shark dropped back into the sea, helpless, yet with its full 
                strength, doomed to lingering starvation- a living death less 
                meet for it than for the man who devised the punishment.</p>

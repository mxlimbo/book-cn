            <td> 
              <p>　　THE DAY CAME FOR OUR DEPARTURE. There was no longer anything 
                to detain us on Endeavor Island. The Ghost's stumpy masts were 
                in place, her crazy sails bent. All my handiwork was strong, none 
                of it beautiful; but I knew that it would work, and I felt myself 
                a man of power as I looked at it. </p>
              <p>　　'I did it! I did it! With my own hands I did it!' I wanted 
                to cry aloud. </p>
              <p>　　But Maud and I had a way of voicing each other's thoughts; 
                and she said, as we prepared to hoist the mainsail: </p>
              <p>　　'To think, Humphrey, you did it all with your own hands!' </p>
              <p>　　'But there were two other hands,' I answered- 'two small hands. 
                And don't say that was also a phrase of your father's.' </p>
              <p>　　She shook her head and laughed, and held her hands up for inspection. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I can never get them clean again,' she wailed, 'nor soften 
                the weather-beat.' </p>
              <p>　　'Then dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honor,' 
                I said, holding them in mine; and, spite of my resolutions, I 
                would have kissed the two dear hands had she not swiftly withdrawn 
                them. </p>
              <p>　　Our comradeship was becoming tremulous. I had mastered my love 
                long and well, but now it was mastering me. Willfully had it disobeyed 
                and won my eyes to speech, and now it was winning my tongue- aye, 
                and my lips, for they were mad this moment to kiss the two small 
                hands which had toiled so faithfully and hard. And I, too, was 
                mad. There was a cry in my being like bugles calling me to her. 
                And there was a wind blowing upon me which I could not resist, 
                swaying the very body of me till I leaned toward her, all unconscious 
                that I leaned. And she knew it. She could not but know it as she 
                swiftly drew away her hands, and yet could not forbear one quick 
                searching look before she turned away her eyes. </p>
              <p>　　By means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards 
                forward to the windlass; and now I hoisted the mainsail, peak 
                and throat, at the same time. It was a clumsy way, but it did 
                not take long, and soon the foresail as well was up and fluttering. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'We can never get that anchor up in this narrow place, once 
                it has left the bottom,' I said. 'We should be on the rocks first.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'What can you do?' she asked. </p>
              <p>　　'Slip it,' my answer. 'And when I do, you must do your first 
                work on the windlass. I shall have to run at once to the wheel, 
                and at the same time you must be hoisting the jib.' </p>
              <p>　　This maneuver of getting under way I had studied and worked 
                out a score of times; and, with the jib-halyard to the windlass, 
                I knew Maud was capable of hoisting that most necessary sail. 
                A brisk wind was blowing into the cover, and, though the water 
                was calm, rapid work was required to get us safely out. </p>
              <p>　　When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared out 
                through the hawse-hole and into the sea. I raced aft, putting 
                the wheel up. The Ghost seemed to start into life as she heeled 
                to the first fill of her sails. The jib was rising. As it filled, 
                the Ghost's bow swung off, and I had to put the wheel down a few 
                spokes and steady her. </p>
              <p>　　I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across 
                of itself, so there was no need for Maud to attend to that; but 
                she was still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down. 
                It was a moment of anxiety, for the Ghost was rushing directly 
                upon the beach, a stone's throw distant. But she swung obediently 
                on her heel into the wind. There was a great fluttering and flapping 
                of canvas and reef-points, most welcome to my ears, then she filled 
                away on the other tack. </p>
              <p>　　Maud had finished her task and come aft, where she stood beside 
                me, a small cap perched on her wind-blown hair, her cheeks flushed 
                from exertion, her eyes wide and bright with the excitement, her 
                nostrils quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air. 
                Her brown eyes were like a startled deer's. There was a wild, 
                keen look in them I had never seen before, and her lips parted 
                and her breath suspended as the Ghost, charging upon the wall 
                of rock at the entrance to the inner cove, swept into the wind 
                and filled away into safe water. </p>
              <p>　　My first mate's berth on the sealing-grounds stood me in good 
                stead, and I cleared the inner cove and laid a long tack along 
                the shore of the outer cover. Once again about, and the Ghost 
                headed out to open sea. She had now caught the bosom-breathing 
                of the ocean, and was herself abreath with the rhythm of it as 
                she smoothly mounted and slipped down each broad-backed wave. 
                The day had been dull and overcast, but the sun now burst through 
                the clouds, a welcome omen, and shone upon the curving beach where 
                together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the holluschickie. 
                All Endeavor Island brightened under the sun. Even the grim southwestern 
                promontory showed less grim, and here and there, where the sea-spray 
                wet its surface, high lights flashed and dazzled in the sun. </p>
              <p>　　'I shall always think of it with pride,' I said to Maud. </p>
              <p>　　She threw her head back in a queenly way, but sad, 'Dear, dear 
                Endeavor Island! I shall always love it.' </p>
              <p>　　'And I,' I said quickly. </p>
              <p>　　It seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding, and 
                yet, loath, they struggled away and did not meet. </p>
              <p>　　There was a silence I might almost call awkward, till I broke 
                it, saying: </p>
              <p>　　'See those black clouds to windward. You remember, I told you 
                last night the barometer was falling.' </p>
              <p>　　'And the sun is gone,' she said, her eyes still fixed upon 
                our island where we had proved our mastery over matter and attained 
                to the truest comradeship which may fall to man and woman. </p>
              <p>　　'And it's slack off the sheets for Japan!' I cried gaily. 'A 
                fair wind and a flowing sheet, you know, or however it goes.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　Lashing the wheel, I ran forward, eased the fore- and main-sheets, 
                took in on the boom-tackles, and trimmed everything for the quartering 
                breeze which was ours. Unfortunately, when running free it is 
                impossible to lash the wheel, so I faced an all-night watch. Maud 
                insisted on relieving me, but proved that she had not the strength 
                to steer in a heavy sea, even if she could have gained the wisdom 
                on such short notice. She appeared quite heartbroken over the 
                discovery, but recovered her spirits by coiling down tackles and 
                halyards and all stray ropes. Then there were meals to be cooked 
                in the galley, beds to make, Wolf Larsen to be attended upon, 
                and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning attack upon 
                the cabin and steerage. </p>
              <p>　　All night I steered, without relief, the wind slowly and steadily 
                increasing and the sea rising. At five in the morning Maud brought 
                me hot coffee and biscuits she had baked, and at seven a substantial 
                and piping hot breakfast put new life into me. </p>
              <p>　　Throughout the day, and as slowly and steadily as ever, the 
                wind increased. And still the Ghost foamed along, racing off the 
                miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots. 
                It was too good to lose, but by nightfall I was exhausted. Though 
                in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel 
                was the limit of my endurance. Besides, I knew, if the wind and 
                sea, increased at the same rate during the night, that it would 
                soon be impossible to heave to. So, as twilight deepened, gladly, 
                and at the same time reluctantly, I brought the Ghost up on the 
                wind. </p>
              <p>　　But I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of 
                three sails meant for one man. While running away from the wind 
                I had not appreciated its force, but when we ceased to run, I 
                learned, to my sorry, and well-nigh to my despair, how fiercely 
                it was really blowing. The wind balked my every effort, ripping 
                the canvas out of my hands and in an instant undoing what I had 
                gained by ten minutes of severest struggle. At eight o'clock I 
                had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the foresail. 
                At eleven o'clock I was no further along. Blood dripped from every 
                finger-end, while the nails were broken to the quick. From pain 
                and sheer exhaustion, I wept in the darkness, secretly, so that 
                Maud should not know. </p>
              <p>　　Then, in desperation, I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail, 
                and resolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed 
                foresail. Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail 
                and jib, and at two in the morning, nearly dead, the life almost 
                buffeted and worked out of me, I had barely sufficient consciousness 
                to know the experiment was a success. </p>
              <p>　　I was famished, but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat. So 
                sleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my 
                chair to prevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching 
                of the schooner. </p>
              <p>　　Of the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing. 
                In fact, I was aware of nothing till I awoke in my bunk, with 
                my boots off. It was dark. I was stiff and lame, and cried out 
                with pain when the bedclothes touched my poor finger-ends. Morning 
                had evidently not come, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep 
                again. I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and 
                it was night again. </p>
              <p>　　Once more I awoke, troubled because I could sleep no better. 
                I struck a match and looked at my watch. It marked midnight. And 
                I had not left the deck until three! I should have been puzzled 
                had I not guessed the solution. No wonder I was sleeping brokenly. 
                I had slept twenty-one hours. I listened for a while to the behavior 
                of the Ghost, to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar 
                of the wind on deck and then turned over on my side and slept 
                peacefully until morning. </p>
              <p>　　When I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud, and concluded 
                she was in the galley preparing breakfast. On deck I found the 
                Ghost doing splendidly under her patch of canvas. But in the galley, 
                though a fire was burning and water boiling, I found no Maud. 
              </p>
              <p>　　I discovered her in the steerage, by Wolf Larsen's bunk. I 
                looked at him- the man who had been hurled down from the topmost 
                pitch of life to be buried alive and be worse than dead. There 
                seemed a relaxation of his expressionless face which was new. 
                Maud looked at me, and I understood. </p>
              <p>　　'His life flickered out in the storm,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'But he still lives,' she answered, infinite faith in her voice. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'He had too great strength.' </p>
              <p>　　'Yes,' she said; 'but now it no longer shackles him. He is 
                a free spirit.' </p>
              <p>　　'He is a free spirit surely,' I answered; and, taking her hand, 
                I led her on deck. </p>
              <p>　　The storm broke that night, which is to say that it diminished 
                as slowly as it had arisen. After breakfast next morning, when 
                I had hoisted Wolf Larsen's body on deck ready for burial, it 
                was still blowing heavily and a large sea was running. The deck 
                was continually awash with the sea which came inboard over the 
                rail and through the scuppers. The wind smote the schooner with 
                a sudden gust, and she heeled over till her lee rail was buried, 
                the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek. We stood 
                in the water to our knees as I bared my head. </p>
              <p>　　'I remember only one part of the service,' I said, 'and that 
                is, &quot;And the body shall be cast into the sea.&quot;' </p>
              <p>　　Maud looked at me, surprised and shocked; but the spirit of 
                something I had seen before was strong upon me, impelling me to 
                give service to Wolf Larsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service 
                to another man. I lifted the end of the hatch-cover, and the canvas-shrouded 
                body slipped feet first into the sea. The weight of iron dragged 
                it down. It was gone. </p>
              <p>　　'Good-by, Lucifer, proud spirit!' Maud whispered so low that 
                it was drowned by the shouting of the wind; but I saw the movement 
                of her lips, and knew. </p>
              <p>　　As we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft, I happened 
                to glance to leeward. The Ghost, at the moment, was uptossed on 
                a sea, and I caught a clear view of a small steamship two or three 
                miles away, rolling and pitching head on to the sea as it steamed 
                toward us. It was painted black, and from the talk of the hunters 
                of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States 
                revenue cutter. I pointed it out to Maud, and hurriedly led her 
                aft to the safety of the poop. </p>
              <p>　　I started to rush below to the flag-locker, then remembered 
                that in rigging the Ghost I had forgotten to make provisions for 
                a flag-halyard. </p>
              <p>　　'We need no distress signal,' Maud said. 'They have only to 
                see us.' </p>
              <p>　　'We are saved!' I said soberly and solemnly. And then, in an 
                exuberance of joy, 'I hardly know whether to be glad or not.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　I looked at her. Our eyes were not loath to meet. We leaned 
                toward each other, and before I knew it, my arms were about her. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'Need I?' I asked. </p>
              <p>　　And she answered: 'There is no need; though the telling of 
                it would be sweet, so sweet.' </p>
              <p>　　Her lips met the press of mine, and, by what strange trick 
                of the imagination I know not, the scene in the cabin of the Ghost 
                flashed upon me, when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my 
                lips and said, 'Hush, hush.' </p>
              <p>　　'My woman, my one small woman,' I said, my free hand petting 
                her shoulder in the way all lovers know though never learn in 
                school. </p>
              <p>　　'My man,' she said, looking at me for an instant with tremulous 
                lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she rested her 
                head against my breast with a happy little sigh. </p>
              <p>　　I looked toward the cutter. It was very close. A boat was being 
                lowered. </p>
              <p>　　'One kiss, dear love,' I whispered. 'One kiss more before they 
                come.' </p>
              <p>　　'And rescue us from ourselves,' she completed, with a most 
                adorable smile, whimsical as I had never seen it, for it was whimsical 
                with love. </p>
              <p>　　 THE END</p>

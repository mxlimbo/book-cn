          <tr> 
            <td> 
              <p>　　THERE WAS A DEAL OF CURSING and groaning as the men at the 
                bottom of the ladder crawled to their feet. </p>
              <p>　　'Somebody strike a light; my thumb's out of joint,' said one 
                of the men, Parsons, a swarthy, saturnine man, steerer in Standish's 
                boat, in which Harrison was puller. </p>
              <p>　　'You'll find it knockin' about by the bitts,' Leach said, sitting 
                down on the edge of the bunk in which I was concealed. </p>
              <p>　　There was a fumbling and a scratching of matches, and the sea-lamp 
                flared up, dim and smoky, and in its weird light bare-legged men 
                moved about, nursing their bruises and caring for their hurts. 
                Oofty-Oofty laid hold of Parsons' thumb, pulling it out stoutly 
                and snapping it back into place. I noticed at the same time that 
                the Kanaka's knuckles were laid open clear across and to the bone. 
                Exposing his beautiful white teeth in a grin, he explained that 
                the wounds had come from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth. </p>
              <p>　　'So it was you, was it, you black beggar?' belligerently demanded 
                Kelly, an Irish-American and a longshoreman making his first trip, 
                and puller for Kerfoot. </p>
              <p>　　As he made the demand he shoved his pugnacious face close to 
                Oofty-oofty. The Kanaka leaped backward to his bunk, to return 
                with a leap, flourishing a long knife. </p>
              <p>　　'Aw, go lay down; you make me tired,' Leach interfered. He 
                was evidently, for all of his youth and inexperience, cock of 
                the forecastle. 'G'wan, you Kelly. You leave Oofty alone. How 
                in- did he know it was you in the dark?' </p>
              <p>　　Kelly subsided with some muttering, and the Kanaka flashed 
                his white teeth in a grateful smile. He was a beautiful creature, 
                almost feminine in the pleasing lines of his figure, and there 
                was a softness and dreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to 
                contradict his reputation for strife and action. </p>
              <p>　　'How did he get away?' said Johnson. </p>
              <p>　　He was sitting on the side of his bunk, the whole pose of his 
                figure indicating utter dejection and hopelessness. He was still 
                breathing heavily from the exertion he had made. His shirt had 
                been ripped entirely from him in the struggle. </p>
              <p>　　'Because he is the devil, as I told you before,' was Leach's 
                answer, and thereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment 
                with tears in his eyes. </p>
              <p>　　'And not one of you to get a knife!' was his unceasing lament. 
              </p>
              <p>　　But the rest had a lively fear of consequences, and gave no 
                heed to him. </p>
              <p>　　'How'll he know which was which?' Kelly asked, and as he went 
                on he looked murderously about him- 'unless one of us peaches.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'He'll know as soon as ever he claps eyes on us,' Parsons replied. 
                'One look at you'd be enough.' </p>
              <p>　　'Tell him the deck flopped up an' gouged yer teeth out iv yer 
                jaw,' Louis grinned. He was the only man who was not out of his 
                bunk, and he was jubilant in that he possessed no bruises to advertise 
                that he had had a hand in the night's work. 'Just wait till he 
                gets a glimpse iv yer mugs tomorrow- the gang iv ye,' he chuckled. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'We'll say we thought it was the mate,' said one. And another: 
                'I know what I'll say- that I heared a row, jumped out of my bunk, 
                got a jolly good crack on the jaw for my pains, an' sailed in 
                myself. Couldn't tell who or what it was in the dark an' just 
                hit out.' </p>
              <p>　　'An' 't was me you hit, of course,' Kelly seconded, his face 
                brightening. </p>
              <p>　　Leach and Johnson took no part in the discussion, and it was 
                plain to see that their mates looked upon them as men for whom 
                the worst was inevitable, who were beyond hope and already dead. 
                Leach stood their fears and reproaches for some time. Then he 
                broke out: </p>
              <p>　　'You make me tired! A nice lot of gazabas you are! If you talked 
                less with yer mouth an' did something with yer hands, he'd 'a' 
                be'n done with by now. Why couldn't one of you, just one of you, 
                get me a knife when I sung out? You make me sick! A-beefin' an' 
                bellerin' round as though he'd kill you when he gets you! You 
                know he won't. Can't afford to. No shippin'-masters or beachcombers 
                over here, an' he wants yer in his business, an' he wants yer 
                bad. Who's to pull or steer or sail ship if he loses yer? It's 
                me an' Johnson have to face the music. Get into yer bunks, now, 
                and shut yer faces; I want to get some sleep.' </p>
              <p>　　'That's all right, all right,' Parsons spoke up. 'Mebbe he 
                won't do for us, but mark my words, hell'll be an ice-box to this 
                ship from now on.' </p>
              <p>　　All the while I had been apprehensive. What would happen to 
                me when these men discovered my presence? I could never fight 
                my way out as Wolf Larsen had done. And at this moment Latimer 
                called down the scuttle: </p>
              <p>　　'Hump, the Old Man wants you.' </p>
              <p>　　'He ain't down here!' said Parsons. </p>
              <p>　　'Yes, he is,' I said, sliding out of the bunk and striving 
                my hardest to keep my voice steady and bold. </p>
              <p>　　The sailors looked at me in consternation. Fear was strong 
                in their faces, and the devilishness which comes of fear. </p>
              <p>　　'I'm coming!' I shouted up to Latimer. </p>
              <p>　　'No, you don't!' Kelly cried, stepping between me and the ladder, 
                his right hand shaped into a veritable strangler's clutch. 'You 
                sneak! I'll shut yer mouth!' </p>
              <p>　　'Let him go!' Leach commanded. </p>
              <p>　　'Not on yer life!' was the angry retort. </p>
              <p>　　Leach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk. 'Let 
                him go, I say,' he repeated, but this time his voice was gritty 
                and metallic. </p>
              <p>　　The Irishman wavered. I made to step by him, and he stood aside. 
                When I had gained the ladder I turned to the circle of brutal 
                and malignant faces peering at me through the semi-darkness. A 
                sudden and deep sympathy welled up in me. </p>
              <p>　　'I have seen and heard nothing, believe me,' I said quietly. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I tell yer, he's all right,' I could hear Leach say as I went 
                up. 'He don't like the Old Man no more nor you or me.' </p>
              <p>　　I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin, stripped and bloody, waiting 
                for me. He greeted me with his whimsical smile. </p>
              <p>　　'Come, get to work, doctor. The signs are favorable for an 
                extensive practice this voyage. I don't know what the Ghost would 
                have been without you, and if I could cherish such noble sentiments, 
                I'd tell you that her master is deeply grateful.' </p>
              <p>　　I knew the run of the simple medicine-chest the Ghost carried, 
                and while I was heating water on the cabin stove and getting the 
                things ready for dressing his wounds, he moved about, laughing 
                and chatting, and examining his hurts with a calculating eye. 
                I had never before seen him stripped, and the sight of his body 
                quite took my breath away. </p>
              <p>　　I must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf 
                Larsen's figure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of 
                it. I had noted the men in the forecastle. Powerfully muscled 
                though some of them were, Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose 
                lines were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, 
                had they been what I should call feminine. </p>
              <p>　　But Wolf Larsen was the man type, the masculine, and almost 
                a god in his perfectness. As he moved about or raised his arms, 
                the great muscles leapt and moved under the satiny skin. I have 
                forgotten to say that the bronze ended with his face. His body, 
                thanks to his Scandinavian stock, was fair as the fairest woman's. 
                I remember his putting his hand up to feel of the wound on his 
                head, and my watching the biceps move like a living thing under 
                its white sheath. </p>
              <p>　　He noticed me, and I became aware that I was staring at him. 
              </p>
              <p>　　'God made you well,' I said. </p>
              <p>　　'Did he?' he answered. 'I have often thought so myself, and 
                wondered why.' </p>
              <p>　　'Purpose-' I began. </p>
              <p>　　'Utility,' he interrupted. 'This body was made for use. These 
                muscles were made to grip and tear and destroy living things that 
                get between me and life. Feel them,' he commanded. </p>
              <p>　　They were as hard as iron. And I observed, also, that his whole 
                body had unconsciously drawn itself together, tense and alert; 
                that muscles were softly crawling and shaping about the hips, 
                along the back, and across the shoulders; that the arms were slightly 
                lifted, their muscles contracting, the fingers crooking till the 
                hands were like talons; and that even the eyes had changed expression 
                and into them were coming watchfulness and measurement and a light 
                none other than of battle. </p>
              <p>　　'Stability, equilibrium,' he said, relaxing on the instant 
                and sinking his body back into repose. 'Feet with which to clutch 
                the ground, legs to stand on and to help withstand, while with 
                arms and hands, teeth and nails, I struggle to kill and not to 
                be killed. Purpose? Utility is the word.' </p>
              <p>　　I did not argue. I had seen the mechanism of the primitive 
                fighting beast, and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen 
                the engines of a battleship or Atlantic liner. </p>
              <p>　　I was surprised, considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle, 
                at the superficiality of his hurts, and I pride myself that I 
                dressed them dexterously. With the exception of two bad wounds, 
                the rest were merely severe bruises and lacerations. The blow 
                which he had received before going overboard had laid his scalp 
                open several inches. This, under his direction, I cleansed and 
                sewed together. </p>
              <p>　　'By the way, Hump, as I have remarked, you are a handy man,' 
                Wolf Larsen began when my work was done. 'As you know, we're short 
                a mate. Hereafter you shall stand watches, receive seventy-five 
                dollars per month, and be addressed fore and aft as Mr. Van Weyden.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　'I- I don't understand navigation, you know,' I gasped. </p>
              <p>　　'Not necessary at all.' </p>
              <p>　　'I really do not care to sit in the high places,' I objected. 
                'I find life precarious enough in my present humble situation. 
                I have no experience. Mediocrity, you see, has its compensations.' 
              </p>
              <p>　　He smiled as though it were all settled. </p>
              <p>　　'I won't be mate on this hell-ship!' I cried defiantly. </p>
              <p>　　I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into 
                his eyes. He walked to the door of his room, saying: </p>
              <p>　　'And now, Mr. Van Weyden, good night.' </p>
              <p>　　'Good night, Mr. Larsen,' I answered weakly.</p>

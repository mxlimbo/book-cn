              <p> 　　Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in 
                the evening and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night 
                with dark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but 
                not muddy, and the troops advanced noiselessly, only occasionally 
                a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard. The men were 
                forbidden to talk out loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike 
                a light, and they tried to prevent their horses neighing. The 
                secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched 
                gaily. Some columns, supposing. they had reached their destination, 
                halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground, but the 
                majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently 
                should not have been.</p>
              <p> 　　Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks (the least important 
                detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. 
                This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path 
                leading from the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed off, was awakened 
                by a deserter from the French army being brought to him. This 
                was a Polish sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, who explained in 
                Polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the 
                service: that he ought long ago to have been made an officer, 
                that he was braver than any of them, and so he had left them and 
                wished to pay them out. He said that Murat was spending the night 
                less than a mile from where they were, and that if they would 
                let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive. 
                Count Orlov-Denisov consulted his fellow officers.</p>
              <p> 　　The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered 
                to go and everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing 
                and arguing, Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided 
                to go with the Polish sergeant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, remember,&quot; said Count Orlov-Denisov to the 
                sergeant at parting, &quot;if you have been lying I'll have you 
                hanged like a dog; but if it's true you shall have a hundred gold 
                pieces!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted 
                and rode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled. They 
                disappeared into the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen 
                Grekov off, returned, shivering from the freshness of the early 
                dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility, 
                and began looking at the enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive 
                light of dawn and the dying campfires. Our columns ought to have 
                begun to appear on an open declivity to his right. He looked in 
                that direction, but though the columns would have been visible 
                quite far off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count 
                that things were beginning to stir in the French camp, and his 
                keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, it is really too late,&quot; said Count Orlov, looking 
                at the camp.</p>
              <p> 　　As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer 
                before our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to 
                him that the sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that 
                the whole Russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those 
                two regiments, which he would lead away heaven only knew where. 
                How could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass 
                of troops!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sure that rascal was lying,&quot; said the count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They can still be called back,&quot; said one of his 
                suite, who like Count Orlov felt distrustful of the adventure 
                when he looked at the enemy's camp.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them 
                go on or not?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you have them fetched back?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fetch them back, fetch them back!&quot; said Count Orlov 
                with sudden determination, looking at his watch. &quot;It will 
                be too late. It is quite light.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grekov. 
                When Grekov returned, Count Orlov-Denisov, excited both by the 
                abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns 
                that still did not appear, as well as by the proximity of the 
                enemy, resolved to advance. All his men felt the same excitement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mount!&quot; he commanded in a whisper. The men took 
                their places and crossed themselves.... &quot;Forward, with God's 
                aid!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah-ah-ah!&quot; reverberated in the forest, and 
                the Cossack companies, trailing their lances and advancing one 
                after another as if poured out of a sack, dashed gaily across 
                the brook toward the camp.</p>
              <p> 　　One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier 
                who saw the Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed 
                and only just waking up, ran off in all directions, abandoning 
                cannons, muskets, and horses.</p>
              <p> 　　Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what 
                was behind and around them, they would have captured Murat and 
                everything there. That was what the officers desired. But it was 
                impossible to make the Cossacks budge when once they had got booty 
                and prisoners. None of them listened to orders. Fifteen hundred 
                prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot, besides 
                standards and (what seemed most important to the Cossacks) horses, 
                saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had to be dealt with, 
                the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided- not without 
                some shouting and even a little themselves- and it was on this 
                that the Cossacks all busied themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: 
                they formed into detachments and began firing. Orlov-Denisov, 
                still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.</p>
              <p> 　　Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that &quot;the 
                First Column will march&quot; and so on, the infantry of the belated 
                columns, commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started 
                in due order and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not 
                to their appointed places. As always happens the men, starting 
                cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense 
                of confusion, and finally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals 
                galloped about, shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had 
                come quite wrong and were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and 
                at last gave it all up and went forward, simply to get somewhere. 
                &quot;We shall get somewhere or other!&quot; And they did indeed 
                get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually 
                even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and 
                only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the 
                part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place 
                to place, finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled 
                on Bagovut's corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, 
                though the corps should long before have joined Orlov-Denisov. 
                Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must 
                be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the commander of the 
                corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying that he ought 
                to be shot. General Bagovut, a fighting old soldier of placid 
                temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion, and 
                cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's surprise and quite 
                contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to 
                Toll.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can 
                die with my men as well as anybody,&quot; he said, and advanced 
                with a single division.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming out onto a field under the enemy's fire, this brave 
                general went straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without 
                considering in his agitation whether going into action now, with 
                a single division, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, 
                and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood. One of 
                the first bullets killed him, and other bullets killed many of 
                his men. And his division remained under fire for some time quite 
                uselessly. </p>

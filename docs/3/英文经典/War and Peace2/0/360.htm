              <p> 　　 When an event is taking place people express their opinions 
                and wishes about it, and as the event results from the collective 
                activity of many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed 
                is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the 
                opinions expressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with 
                the event as a command preceding it.</p>
              <p> 　　Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion 
                as to how and where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it 
                happens that this is done as one of them said. He ordered it. 
                There we have command and power in their primary form. The man 
                who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what 
                he was doing, or reflect on or command what would result from 
                the common activity; while the man who commanded more would evidently 
                work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity.</p>
              <p> 　　When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to 
                a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who, because 
                their activity is given to directing and commanding, take less 
                less part in the direct work.</p>
              <p> 　　When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections 
                which as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his 
                present activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. 
                Just the same is done by a concourse of people, allowing those 
                who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations, 
                justifications, and surmises concerning their collective activity.</p>
              <p> 　　For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown 
                and kill one another. And corresponding to the event its justification 
                appears in people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare 
                of France, for liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill 
                one another, and this event was accompanied by its justification 
                in the necessity for a centralization of power, resistance to 
                Europe, and so on. Men went from the west to the east killing 
                their fellow men, and the event was accompanied by phrases about 
                the glory of France, the baseness of England, and so on. History 
                shows us that these justifications of the events have no common 
                sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of killing a man 
                as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing of millions 
                in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these justifications 
                have a very necessary significance in their own day.</p>
              <p> 　　These justifications release those who produce the events 
                from moral responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom 
                fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails 
                in front: they clear men's moral responsibilities from their path.</p>
              <p> 　　Without such justification there would be no reply to the 
                simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical 
                event. How is it that millions of men commit collective crimes- 
                make war, commit murder, and so on?</p>
              <p> 　　With the present complex forms of political and social life 
                in Europe can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered 
                by monarchs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? 
                Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification 
                in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or 
                in civilization? So that every event that occurs inevitably coincides 
                with some expressed wish and, receiving a justification, presents 
                itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men.</p>
              <p> 　　In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves 
                it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board 
                the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible 
                motion.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of 
                that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we 
                convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward 
                movement of the ship, and that we were led into error by the fact 
                that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving.</p>
              <p> 　　We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement 
                of historical characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable 
                condition of all that occurs- the continuity of movement in time) 
                and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical 
                persons with the masses.</p>
              <p> 　　When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the 
                same wave ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead 
                of it also turns frequently. But wherever it may turn there always 
                will be the wave anticipating its movement.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was 
                foreseen and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water 
                which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of 
                it, and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself 
                but to govern the ship's movement also.</p>
              <p> 　　 Examining only those expressions of the will of historical 
                persons which, as commands, were related to events, historians 
                have assumed that the events depended on those commands. But examining 
                the events themselves and the connection in which the historical 
                persons stood to the people, we have found that they and their 
                orders were dependent on events. The incontestable proof of this 
                deduction is that, however many commands were issued, the event 
                does not take place unless there are other causes for it, but 
                as soon as an event occurs- be it what it may- then out of all 
                the continually expressed wishes of different people some will 
                always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance 
                are related as commands to the events.</p>
              <p> 　　Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively 
                to these two essential questions of history:</p>
              <p> 　　(1) What is power?</p>
              <p> 　　(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?</p>
              <p> 　　(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, 
                in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, 
                and justifications of the collective action that is performed, 
                the less is his participation in that action.</p>
              <p> 　　(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by 
                intellectual activity, nor even by a combination of the two as 
                historians have supposed, but by the activity of all the people 
                who participate in the events, and who always combine in such 
                a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event 
                take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa.</p>
              <p> 　　Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically 
                it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity 
                is inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event 
                is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the 
                two.</p>
              <p> 　　Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable 
                to the phenomena we are examining.</p>
              <p> 　　In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity- that 
                final limit to which in every domain of thought man's reason arrives 
                if it is not playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, 
                heat produces electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms 
                repel one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of 
                atoms, we cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so 
                because it is inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and 
                that it is a law. The same applies to historical events. Why war 
                and revolution occur we do not know. We only know that to produce 
                the one or the other action, people combine in a certain formation 
                in which they all take part, and we say that this is so because 
                it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words that it is a law.

              <p> 　　Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had 
                always been absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different 
                character from those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in 
                speech, dress, and disposition. They were called steppe peasants. 
                The old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at 
                work when they came to Bald Hills to help with the harvest or 
                to dig ponds, and ditches, but he disliked them for their boorishness.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's last stay at Bogucharovo, when he introduced 
                hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had 
                to pay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary 
                strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called 
                boorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among 
                them: at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; 
                at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; 
                then of some proclamation of the Tsar's and of an oath to the 
                Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that 
                freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it), 
                then of Peter Fedorovich's return to the throne in seven years' 
                time, when everything would be made free and so &quot;simple&quot; 
                that there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte 
                and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort 
                of vague notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and &quot;pure 
                freedom.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging 
                to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could 
                work where they pleased. There were very few resident landlords 
                in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, 
                and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious 
                undercurrents in the life of the Russian people, the causes and 
                meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were more 
                clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance, 
                which had occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among 
                the peasants to emigrate to some unknown &quot;warm rivers.&quot; 
                Hundreds of peasants, among them the Bogucharovo folk, suddenly 
                began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward 
                the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so 
                these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast, 
                to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off in caravans, 
                bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or walked 
                toward the &quot;warm rivers.&quot; Many of them were punished, 
                some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, 
                many returned of their own accord, and the movement died down 
                of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason. But 
                such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered 
                new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, 
                and at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, 
                to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent 
                that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old 
                prince's death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that 
                contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where 
                over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away 
                and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the 
                peasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were, it was rumored, 
                in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that passed 
                from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from domestic 
                serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great 
                influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving 
                a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks 
                were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not 
                harm them. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another 
                peasant had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which 
                was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general 
                that no harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained 
                they would be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this 
                the peasant had brought from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes 
                (he did not know that they were false) paid to him in advance 
                for hay.</p>
              <p> 　　More important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning 
                of the very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts 
                to move the princess' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been 
                a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but 
                to wait. Yet there was no time to waste. On the fifteenth, the 
                day of the old prince's death, the Marshal had insisted on Princess 
                Mary's leaving at once, as it was becoming dangerous. He had told 
                her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what 
                might happen. On the evening of the day the old prince died the 
                Marshal went away, promising to return next day for the funeral. 
                But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that the 
                French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove 
                his own family and valuables from his estate.</p>
              <p> 　　For some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the 
                village Elder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive 
                &quot;Dronushka.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants 
                who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged 
                till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss 
                of a tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after the migration to the &quot;warm rivers,&quot; in 
                which he had taken part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder 
                and overseer of Bogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably 
                for twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they 
                did their master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, 
                and the steward respected him and jestingly called him &quot;the 
                Minister.&quot; During the whole time of his service Dron had 
                never been drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights or the hardest 
                tasks had he shown the least fatigue, and though he could not 
                read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number 
                of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for 
                the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single 
                acre of the Bogucharovo fields.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, 
                sent for his Dron on the day of the prince's funeral and told 
                him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess' carriages 
                and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from Bogucharovo. 
                Though the peasants paid quitrent, Alpatych thought no difficulty 
                would be made about complying with this order, for there were 
                two hundred and thirty households at work in Bogucharovo and the 
                peasants were well to do. But on hearing the order Dron lowered 
                his eyes and remained silent. Alpatych named certain peasants 
                he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.</p>
              <p> 　　Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting. 
                Alpatych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no 
                horses available: some horses were carting for the government, 
                others were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. 
                It seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, 
                much less for the carting.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron 
                was a model village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince's 
                estates for twenty years in vain. He a model steward, possessing 
                in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts 
                of those he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood 
                that his answers did not express his personal views but the general 
                mood of the Bogucharovo commune, by which the Elder had already 
                been carried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired 
                property and was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between 
                the two camps: the masters' and the serfs'. He noticed this hesitation 
                in Dron's look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now just listen, Dronushka,&quot; said he. &quot;Don't 
                talk nonsense to me. His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave 
                me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with 
                the enemy, and there is an order from the Tsar about it too. Anyone 
                who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you hear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hear,&quot; Dron answered without lifting his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych was not satisfied with this reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!&quot; he said, shaking 
                his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The power is in your hands,&quot; Dron rejoined sadly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, Dron, drop it!&quot; Alpatych repeated, withdrawing 
                his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at 
                Dron's feet. &quot;I can see through you and three yards into 
                the ground under you,&quot; he continued, gazing at the floor 
                in front of Dron.</p>
              <p> 　　Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again 
                lowered his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready 
                to leave their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for 
                tomorrow morning for the princess' things. And don't go to any 
                meeting yourself, do you hear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dron suddenly fell on his knees.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me 
                and discharge me, for Christ's sake!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop that!&quot; cried Alpatych sternly. &quot;I see 
                through you and three yards under you,&quot; he repeated, knowing 
                that his skill in beekeeping, his knowledge of the right time 
                to sow the oats, and the fact that he had been able to retain 
                the old prince's favor for twenty years had long since gained 
                him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of seeing 
                three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.</p>
              <p> 　　Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpatych interrupted 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What 
                are you thinking of, eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What am I to do with the people?&quot; said Dron. &quot;They're 
                quite beside themselves; I have already told them...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'Told them,' I dare say!&quot; said Alpatych. &quot;Are 
                they drinking?&quot; he asked abruptly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quite beside themselves, Yakov Alpatych; they've fetched 
                another barrel.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, listen! I'll go to the police officer, and 
                you tell them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must 
                be got ready.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I understand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych did not insist further. He had managed people for 
                a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to 
                show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung 
                a submissive &quot;I understand&quot; from Dron, Alpatych contented 
                himself with that, though he not only doubted but felt almost 
                certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be 
                forthcoming.</p>
              <p> 　　And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. 
                In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being 
                held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into 
                the woods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying 
                anything of this to the princess, Alpatych had his own belongings 
                taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had 
                those horses got ready for the princess' carriages. Meanwhile 
                he went himself to the police authorities.</p>

              <p> 　　It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose 
                heap has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging 
                bits of rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, 
                or why they jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would 
                be equally difficult to explain what caused the Russians after 
                the departure of the French to throng to the place that had formerly 
                been Moscow. But when we watch the ants round their ruined heap, 
                the tenacity, energy, and immense number of the delving insects 
                prove that despite the destruction of the heap, something indestructible, 
                which though intangible is the real strength of the colony, still 
                exists; and similarly, though in Moscow in the month of October 
                there was no government no churches, shrines, riches, or houses- 
                it was still the Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, 
                except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible.</p>
              <p> 　　The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow 
                after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, 
                and at first for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only 
                they all had in common: a desire to get to the place that had 
                been called Moscow, to apply their activities there.</p>
              <p> 　　Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, 
                in a fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn 
                of 1813 the number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what 
                it had been in 1812.</p>
              <p> 　　The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode's 
                detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents 
                who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. 
                The Russians who entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered 
                it in their turn. They continued what the French had begun. Trains 
                of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the villages what 
                had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks 
                carried off what they could to their camps, and the householders 
                seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their 
                own, pretending that it was their property.</p>
              <p> 　　But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third 
                contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more 
                and more difficult and assumed more definite forms.</p>
              <p> 　　The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations 
                of regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, 
                with luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These 
                forms were lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, 
                warehouses, market stalls, granaries- for the most part still 
                stocked with goods- and there were factories and workshops, palaces 
                and wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government 
                offices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer the French remained 
                the more these forms of town life perished, until finally all 
                was merged into one confused, lifeless scene of plunder.</p>
              <p> 　　The more the plundering by the French continued, the more 
                both the wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was 
                destroyed. But plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation 
                of the city began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued 
                and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more 
                rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by 
                curiosity, some by official duties, some by self-interest- house 
                owners, clergy, officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and 
                peasants- streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.</p>
              <p> 　　Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry 
                off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the 
                corpses out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their 
                comrades' discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, 
                and beat down one another's prices to below what they had been 
                in former days. Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived 
                in Moscow every day, and on all sides logs were being hewn, new 
                houses built, and old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began 
                trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially 
                burned houses. The clergy resumed the services in many churches 
                that had not been burned. Donors contributed Church property that 
                had been stolen. Government clerks set up their baize-covered 
                tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms. The 
                higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of 
                goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which 
                much property had been left, brought there from other houses, 
                complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted 
                Palace in the Kremlin; others insisted that as the French had 
                gathered things from different houses into this or that house, 
                it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found 
                there. They abused the police and bribed them, made out estimates 
                at ten times their value for government stores that had perished 
                in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin wrote proclamations.

              <p> 　　What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the 
                campaign of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling 
                of regret, dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked 
                himself how it is that the French were not all captured or destroyed 
                when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers, when 
                the disordered French, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, 
                and when (as the historians relate) the aim of the Russians was 
                to stop the French, to cut them off, and capture them all?</p>
              <p> 　　How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker 
                than the French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve 
                its purpose when it had surrounded the French on three sides and 
                when its aim was to capture them? Can the French be so enormously 
                superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior 
                forces we could not beat them? How could that happen?</p>
              <p> 　　History (or what is called by that name) replying to these 
                questions says that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov 
                and Chichagov, and this man and that man, did not execute such 
                and such maneuvers...</p>
              <p> 　　But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they 
                were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not 
                tried and punished? But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, 
                and others were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still 
                incomprehensible why, the position of the Russian army being what 
                it was at Krasnoe and at the Berezina (in both cases we had superior 
                forces), the French army with its marshals, kings, and Emperor 
                was not captured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.</p>
              <p> 　　The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military 
                historians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack) is 
                unfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from 
                attacking at Vyazma and Tarutino.</p>
              <p> 　　Why was the Russian army- which with inferior forces had withstood 
                the enemy in full strength at Borodino- defeated at Krasnoe and 
                the Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it 
                was numerically superior?</p>
              <p> 　　If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing 
                Napoleon and his marshals- and that aim was not merely frustrated 
                but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled- then 
                this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by 
                the French to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered 
                victorious by Russian historians.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to 
                claims of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their 
                lyrical rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly 
                admit that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories 
                for Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that 
                such a conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of 
                French victories brought the French complete destruction, while 
                the series of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of 
                their enemy and the liberation of their country.</p>
              <p> 　　The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the 
                historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns 
                and the generals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, 
                have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim 
                that never existed, namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon 
                with his marshals and his army.</p>
              <p> 　　There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would 
                have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　It would have been senseless, first because Napoleon's disorganized 
                army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to 
                say, was doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the 
                use of performing various operations on the French who were running 
                away as fast as they possibly could?</p>
              <p> 　　Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage 
                of men whose whole energy was directed to flight.</p>
              <p> 　　Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one's own 
                troops in order to destroy the French army, which without external 
                interference was destroying itself at such a rate that, though 
                its path was not blocked, it could not carry across the frontier 
                more than it actually did in December, namely a hundredth part 
                of the original army.</p>
              <p> 　　Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive 
                the Emperor, kings, and dukes- whose capture would have been in 
                the highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most 
                adroit diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) 
                recognized. Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture 
                army corps of the French, when our own army had melted away to 
                half before reaching Krasnoe and a whole division would have been 
                needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and when our men were 
                not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken 
                were perishing of hunger.</p>
              <p> 　　All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon 
                and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when 
                driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds 
                he had planted, should run to the gate and hit the cow on the 
                head. The only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would 
                be that he was very angry. But not even that could be said for 
                those who drew up this project, for it was not they who had suffered 
                from the trampled beds.</p>
              <p> 　　But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army 
                would have been senseless, it was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　It was impossible first because- as experience shows that 
                a three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides 
                with the plans- the probability of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein 
                effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote 
                as to be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kutuzov, 
                who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned 
                over great distances do not yield the desired results.</p>
              <p> 　　Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum 
                with which Napoleon's army was retiring, incomparably greater 
                forces than the Russians possessed would have been required.</p>
              <p> 　　Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term &quot;to 
                cut off&quot; has no meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, 
                but not an army. To cut off an army- to bar its road- is quite 
                impossible, for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture 
                and there is the night when nothing can be seen, as the military 
                scientists might convince themselves by the example of Krasnoe 
                and of the Berezina. It is only possible to capture prisoners 
                if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible to catch 
                a swallow if it settles on one's hand. Men can only be taken prisoners 
                if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics, 
                as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not 
                consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold 
                awaited them in flight or captivity alike.</p>
              <p> 　　Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since 
                the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as 
                those that obtained in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit 
                of the French strained its strength to the utmost and could not 
                have done more without destroying itself.</p>
              <p> 　　During the movement of the Russian army from Tarutino to Krasnoe 
                it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal 
                to the population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell 
                out of the army without a battle.</p>
              <p> 　　And it is of this period of the campaign- when the army lacked 
                boots and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without 
                vodka, and was camping out at night for months in the snow with 
                fifteen degrees of frost, when there were only seven or eight 
                hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence 
                of discipline cannot be maintained, when men were taken into that 
                region of death where discipline fails, not for a few hours only 
                as in a battle, but for months, where they were every moment fighting 
                death from hunger and cold, when half the army perished in a single 
                month- it is of this period of the campaign that the historians 
                tell us how Miloradovich should have made a flank march to such 
                and such a place, Tormasov to another place, and Chichagov should 
                have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, 
                and how so-and-so &quot;routed&quot; and &quot;cut off&quot; the 
                French and so on and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should 
                have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they 
                are not to blame because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, 
                proposed that they should do what was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand 
                between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because 
                the historians dealing with the matter have written the history 
                of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals, and 
                not the history of the events.</p>
              <p> 　　To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and 
                so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received; 
                but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in 
                hospitals and in graves does not even interest them, for it does 
                not come within the range of their investigation.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general 
                plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands 
                of men who took a direct part in the events, and all the questions 
                that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and 
                certain solution.</p>
              <p> 　　The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed 
                except in the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist 
                because it was senseless and unattainable.</p>
              <p> 　　The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. 
                That aim was attained in the first place of itself, as the French 
                ran away, and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. 
                Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying 
                the French, and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army 
                was following the French, ready to use its strength in case their 
                movement stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. 
                And the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip 
                raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

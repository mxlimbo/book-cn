              <p> 　　When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was 
                with the Rostovs at Yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there, 
                in spite of her aunt's efforts to dissuade her- and not merely 
                to go herself but to take her nephew with her. Whether it were 
                difficult or easy, possible or impossible, she did not ask and 
                did not want to know: it was her duty not only herself to be near 
                her brother who was perhaps dying, but to do everything possible 
                to take his son to him, and so she prepared to set off. That she 
                had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary attributed 
                to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long 
                journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.</p>
              <p> 　　In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages 
                were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, 
                a semiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three 
                maids, Tikhon, and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent 
                to accompany her.</p>
              <p> 　　The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and 
                the roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk, 
                Ryazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long and, as post horses 
                were not everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan 
                where the French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.</p>
              <p> 　　During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, 
                and Princess Mary's servants were astonished at her energy and 
                firmness of spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than 
                any of them, and no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity 
                and energy, which infected her fellow travelers, they approached 
                Yaroslavl by the end of the second week.</p>
              <p> 　　The last days of her stay in Voronezh had been the happiest 
                of her life. Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated 
                her. It filled her whole soul, had become an integral part of 
                herself, and she no longer struggled against it. Latterly she 
                had become convinced that she loved and was beloved, though she 
                never said this definitely to herself in words. She had become 
                convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas, when he had 
                come to tell her that her brother was with the Rostovs. Not by 
                a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that Prince Andrew's 
                relations with Natasha might, if he recovered, be renewed, but 
                Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet in spite of that, his relation to her- considerate, delicate, 
                and loving- not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed 
                to Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection 
                between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. 
                She knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life 
                and felt that she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it.</p>
              <p> 　　But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did 
                not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; 
                on the contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made 
                it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling 
                for her brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving 
                Voronezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn, 
                despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. 
                But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which 
                she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief 
                and gave her strength.</p>
              <p> 　　As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only 
                of the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached 
                Yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there- not after 
                many days, but that very evening- again presented itself to her 
                and her agitation increased to its utmost limit.</p>
              <p> 　　The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where 
                the Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince 
                Andrew was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates 
                was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that 
                looked out at him from the window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs 
                are staying at the merchant Bronnikov's house, in the Square not 
                far from here, right above the Volga,&quot; said the courier.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding 
                why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was 
                her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is the prince?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His excellency is staying in the same house with them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then he is alive,&quot; thought Princess Mary, and asked 
                in a low voice: &quot;How is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The servants say he is still the same.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　What &quot;still the same&quot; might mean Princess Mary did 
                not ask, but with an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old 
                Nicholas, who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure 
                at the town, she bowed her head and did not raise it again till 
                the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying, came to a stop. 
                The carriage steps clattered as they were let down.</p>
              <p> 　　The carriage door was opened. On the left there was water- 
                a great river- and on the right a porch. There were people at 
                the entrance: servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of 
                black hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly 
                affected way. (This was Sonya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. 
                &quot;This way, this way!&quot; said the girl, with the same artificial 
                smile, and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly 
                woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to meet her with a look 
                of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced Princess Mary 
                and kissed her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mon enfant!&quot; she muttered, &quot;je vous aime et 
                vous connais depuis longtemps.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;My child! I love you and have known you a long time.&quot; 
                Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the 
                countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly 
                knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases 
                in French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to 
                her, and asked: &quot;How is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The doctor says that he is not in danger,&quot; said 
                the countess, but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, 
                and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he? Can I see him- can I?&quot; asked the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his 
                son?&quot; said the countess, turning to little Nicholas who was 
                coming in with Dessalles. &quot;There will be room for everybody, 
                this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely boy!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where 
                Sonya was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed 
                the boy, and the old count came in and welcomed the princess. 
                He had changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him. 
                Then he had been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured old man; now 
                he seemed a pitiful, bewildered person. While talking to Princess 
                Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether 
                he was doing the right thing. After the destruction of Moscow 
                and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed 
                to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that 
                there was no longer a place for him in life.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, 
                and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to 
                see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending 
                to admire her nephew, the princess noticed all that was going 
                on around her and felt the necessity of submitting, for a time, 
                to this new order of things which she had entered. She knew it 
                to be necessary, and though it was hard for her she was not vexed 
                with these people.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is my niece,&quot; said the count, introducing 
                Sonya- &quot;You don't know her, Princess?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary turned to Sonya and, trying to stifle the hostile 
                feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But 
                she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around 
                her was so far from what was in her own heart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he?&quot; she asked again, addressing them 
                all.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is downstairs. Natasha is with him,&quot; answered 
                Sonya, flushing. &quot;We have sent to ask. I think you must be 
                tired, Princess.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary's eyes. 
                She turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to 
                go to him, when light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps 
                were heard at the door. The princess looked round and saw Natasha 
                coming in, almost running- that Natasha whom she had liked so 
                little at their meeting in Moscow long since.</p>
              <p> 　　But hardly had the princess looked at Natasha's face before 
                she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently 
                a friend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry 
                on her shoulder.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Natasha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew's 
                bed, heard of Princess Mary's arrival, she softly left his room 
                and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant 
                to Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　There was only one expression on her agitated face when she 
                ran into the drawing room- that of love- boundless love for him, 
                for her, and for all that was near to the man she loved; and of 
                pity, suffering for others, and passionate desire to give herself 
                entirely to helping them. It was plain that at that moment there 
                was in Natasha's heart no thought of herself or of her own relations 
                with Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all 
                this at the first glance at Natasha's face, and wept on her shoulder 
                with sorrowful pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, come to him, Mary,&quot; said Natasha, leading 
                her into the other room.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned 
                to Natasha. She felt that from her she would be able to understand 
                and learn everything.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How...&quot; she began her question but stopped short.</p>
              <p> 　　She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words. 
                Natasha's face eyes would eyes would have to tell her all more 
                clearly and profoundly.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt 
                whether to say all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before 
                those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her 
                heart, it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she 
                saw. And suddenly, Natasha's lips twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered 
                round her mouth, and covering her face with her hands she burst 
                into sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary understood.</p>
              <p> 　　But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not 
                trust:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how is his wound? What is his general condition?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You, you... will see,&quot; was all Natasha could say.</p>
              <p> 　　They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they 
                had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he 
                grew worse? When did this happen?&quot; Princess Mary inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from 
                his feverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Troitsa 
                that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. 
                That danger had also passed. When they reached Yaroslavl the wound 
                had begun to fester (Natasha knew all about such things as festering) 
                and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal 
                course. Then fever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was 
                not very serious.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But two days ago this suddenly happened,&quot; said 
                Natasha, struggling with her sobs. &quot;I don't know why, but 
                you will see what he is like.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he weaker? Thinner?&quot; asked the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, 
                he is too good, he cannot, cannot live, because...&quot;</p>

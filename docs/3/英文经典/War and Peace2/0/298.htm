              <p> 　　A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To 
                be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something 
                good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles. One must have 
                the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move.</p>
              <p> 　　The promised land for the French during their advance had 
                been Moscow, during their retreat it was their native land. But 
                that native land was too far off, and for a man going a thousand 
                miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and 
                to say to himself: &quot;Today I shall get to a place twenty-five 
                miles off where I shall rest and spend the night,&quot; and during 
                the first day's journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate 
                goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And the impulses 
                felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　For the French retreating along the old Smolensk road, the 
                final goal- their native land- was too remote, and their immediate 
                goal was Smolensk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously 
                intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew 
                that much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk, nor 
                that they were told so (on the contrary their superior officers, 
                and Napoleon himself, knew that provisions were scarce there), 
                but because this alone could give them strength to move on and 
                endure their present privations. So both those who knew and those 
                who did not know deceived themselves, and pushed on to Smolensk 
                as to a promised land.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising 
                energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed 
                on. Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of 
                French into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy, 
                there was another cause binding them together- their great numbers. 
                As with the physical law of gravity, their enormous mass drew 
                the individual human atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands 
                they moved like a whole nation.</p>
              <p> 　　Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up 
                as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery; but on 
                the one hand the force of this common attraction to Smolensk, 
                their goal, drew each of them in the same direction; on the other 
                hand an army corps could not surrender to a company, and though 
                the French availed themselves of every convenient opportunity 
                to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent 
                pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their very numbers 
                and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility 
                and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the Russians 
                to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all 
                their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption 
                of the body could hasten the process of decomposition.</p>
              <p> 　　A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is 
                a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can 
                melt the snow. On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified 
                the remaining snow becomes.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone understood this. When 
                the flight of the French army along the Smolensk road became well 
                defined, what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh 
                of October began to occur. The superior officers all wanted to 
                distinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to capture, and 
                to overthrow the French, and all clamored for action.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited 
                in the case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not tell them what we say now: &quot;Why fight, why 
                block the road, losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering 
                unfortunate wretches? What is the use of that, when a third of 
                their army has melted away on the road from Moscow to Vyazma without 
                any battle?&quot; But drawing from his aged wisdom what they could 
                understand, he told them of the golden bridge, and they laughed 
                at and slandered him, flinging themselves on, rending and exulting 
                over the dying beast.</p>
              <p> 　　Ermolov, Miloradovich, Platov, and others in proximity to 
                the French near Vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off 
                and break up two French corps, and by way of reporting their intention 
                to Kutuzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.</p>
              <p> 　　And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked, 
                trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced 
                to the attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and 
                lost thousands of men.</p>
              <p> 　　But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French 
                army, closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily 
                melting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolensk. </p>

              <p> 　　Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the 
                Emperor honored by his presence. Kutuzov had received the Order 
                of St. George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the 
                highest honors, but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction 
                with him. The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the 
                first to set that example, but everybody understood that the old 
                man was blameworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutuzov, conforming 
                to a custom of Catherine's day, ordered the standards that had 
                been captured to be lowered at the Emperor's feet on his entering 
                the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face and muttered something 
                in which some people caught the words, &quot;the old comedian.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor's displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased 
                at Vilna by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would 
                not understand the importance of the coming campaign.</p>
              <p> 　　When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers 
                assembled about him: &quot;You have not only saved Russia, you 
                have saved Europe!&quot; they all understood that the war was 
                not ended.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his 
                opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to 
                the glory of Russia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious 
                position that Russia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor 
                the impossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships 
                already endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and 
                so forth.</p>
              <p> 　　This being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally 
                regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.</p>
              <p> 　　To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural 
                method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and 
                with Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign- to transfer 
                the authority to the Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground 
                from under the commander in chief's feet without upsetting the 
                old man by informing him of the change.</p>
              <p> 　　With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and 
                its real strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, 
                Konovnitsyn, and Ermolov received fresh appointments. Everyone 
                spoke loudly of the field marshal's great weakness and failing 
                health.</p>
              <p> 　　His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and 
                given to another. And in fact his health was poor.</p>
              <p> 　　So naturally, simply, and gradually- just as he had come from 
                Turkey to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and 
                then to the army when he was needed there- now when his part was 
                played out, Kutuzov's place was taken by a new and necessary performer.</p>
              <p> 　　The war 1812, besides its national significance dear to every 
                Russian heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.</p>
              <p> 　　The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded 
                by a movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh 
                war another leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing 
                from Kutuzov's and animated by different motives.</p>
              <p> 　　Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples 
                from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as 
                Kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, 
                or Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative 
                of the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and 
                Russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, 
                there was nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for 
                the representative of the national war but to die, and Kutuzov 
                died. </p>

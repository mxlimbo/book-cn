              <p> 　　Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was 
                galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight 
                of him, galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead 
                of him. He tried to pass either in front of them or to the right 
                or left, but there were soldiers everywhere, all with expression 
                and busy with some unseen but evidently important task. They all 
                gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this 
                stout man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened 
                to trample them under his horse's hoofs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why ride into the middle of the battalion?&quot; one 
                of them shouted at him.</p>
              <p> 　　Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and 
                Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control 
                his shying horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was 
                a free space.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood 
                firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had 
                come to the bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino, 
                which the French (having occupied Borodino) were attacking in 
                the first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge 
                in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both 
                sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay 
                which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires 
                the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there 
                he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice 
                the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles 
                that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of 
                the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, 
                though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which 
                did not leave his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why's that fellow in front of the line?&quot; shouted 
                somebody at him again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the left!... Keep to the right!&quot; the men shouted 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one 
                of Raevski's adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily 
                at him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing 
                him he nodded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How have you got here?&quot; he said, and galloped on.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, 
                and afraid of getting in someone's way again, galloped after the 
                adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's happening here? May I come with you?&quot; he 
                asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One moment, one moment!&quot; replied the adjutant, 
                and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, 
                he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why have you come here, Count?&quot; he asked with a 
                smile. &quot;Still inquisitive?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; assented Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here it's tolerable,&quot; said he, &quot;but with Bagration 
                on the left flank they're getting it frightfully hot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Where is that?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from 
                there and in our battery it is still bearable,&quot; said the 
                adjutant. &quot;Will you come?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I'll come with you,&quot; replied Pierre, looking 
                round for his groom.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along 
                or being carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden 
                over the day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented 
                hay, with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why haven't they carried him away?&quot; Pierre was 
                about to ask, but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant 
                who was also looking that way, he checked himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with 
                the adjutant to Raevski's Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the 
                adjutant's and jolted him at every step.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You don't seem to be used to riding, Count?&quot; remarked 
                the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No it's not that, but her action seems so jerky,&quot; 
                said Pierre in a puzzled tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why... she's wounded!&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;In 
                the off foreleg above the knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate 
                you, Count, on your baptism of fire!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the 
                artillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening 
                them with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There 
                it was cool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the 
                adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is the general here?&quot; asked the adjutant on reaching 
                the knoll.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,&quot; 
                someone told him, pointing to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with 
                him now.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't trouble about me,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I'll 
                go up onto the knoll if I may?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, do. You'll see everything from there and it's less 
                dangerous, and I'll come for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They 
                did not meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that 
                he lost an arm that day.</p>
              <p> 　　The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards 
                known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski's Redoubt, 
                and to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la 
                redoute du centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which 
                the French regarded as the key to the whole position.</p>
              <p> 　　This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which 
                trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns 
                that were being fired through openings in the earthwork.</p>
              <p> 　　In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which 
                also fired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. 
                When ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, 
                on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns 
                were firing, was the most important point of the battle.</p>
              <p> 　　On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought 
                it one of the least significant parts of the field.</p>
              <p> 　　Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a 
                trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on 
                around him with an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he 
                rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile, 
                trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading, hauling 
                the guns, and continually running past him with bags and charges. 
                The guns of that battery were being fired continually one after 
                another with a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood 
                in powder smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed 
                in support, here in the battery where a small number of men busy 
                at their work were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone 
                experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation.</p>
              <p> 　　The intrusion of Pierre's nonmilitary figure in a white hat 
                made an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance 
                at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The 
                senior artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, 
                moved over to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun 
                and looked at him with curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently 
                only just out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding 
                the two guns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir,&quot; he said, &quot;permit me to ask you to stand 
                aside. You must not be here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked 
                at Pierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man 
                in the white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on 
                the slope of the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way 
                for the soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as 
                calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile 
                distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering 
                sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, 
                and in general for the animals that live with the regiment. The 
                men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him, gave 
                him a nickname (&quot;our gentleman&quot;), and made kindly fun 
                of him among themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked 
                around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth 
                it had thrown up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?&quot; 
                a red-faced, broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin 
                that disclosed a set of sound, white teeth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you afraid, then?&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What else do you expect?&quot; answered the soldier. 
                &quot;She has no mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, 
                out go your innards. One can't help being afraid,&quot; he said 
                laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside 
                Pierre. They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody 
                else, and the discovery that he did so delighted them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman 
                it's wonderful! There's a gentleman for you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To your places!&quot; cried the young officer to the 
                men gathered round Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for 
                the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors 
                and the men with great precision and formality.</p>
              <p> 　　The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing 
                more intense over the whole field, especially to the left where 
                Bagration's fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the 
                firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, 
                his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle- 
                separated from all else- formed by the men in the battery. His 
                first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the 
                sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another, 
                especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. 
                Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he observed the faces 
                of those around him.</p>
              <p> 　　By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away 
                from the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell 
                more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed 
                and whistled around. But the men in the battery seemed not to 
                notice this, and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A live one!&quot; shouted a man as a whistling shell 
                approached.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not this way! To the infantry!&quot; added another with 
                loud laughter, seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks 
                of the supports.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you bowing to a friend, eh?&quot; remarked another, 
                chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.</p>
              <p> 　　Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking 
                out to see what was happening in front.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They've withdrawn the front line, it has retired,&quot; 
                said they, pointing over the earthwork.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mind your own business,&quot; an old sergeant shouted 
                at them. &quot;If they've retired it's because there's work for 
                them to do farther back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, 
                gave him a shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of 
                laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the fifth gun, wheel it up!&quot; came shouts from 
                one side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, all together, like bargees!&quot; rose the 
                merry voices of those who were moving the gun.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman's hat off!&quot; 
                cried the red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. 
                &quot;Awkward baggage!&quot; he added reproachfully to a cannon 
                ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man's leg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, you foxes!&quot; said another, laughing at 
                some militiamen who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry 
                away the wounded man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you crows! You're 
                scared!&quot; they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating 
                before the man whose leg had been torn off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, lads... oh, oh!&quot; they mimicked the peasants, 
                &quot;they don't like it at all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, 
                and after every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.</p>
              <p> 　　As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more 
                vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if 
                in opposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden 
                fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these 
                men.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned 
                to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in 
                watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he 
                felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul.</p>
              <p> 　　At ten o'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes 
                in front of the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated. 
                From the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying 
                their wounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came 
                to the battery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre 
                an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry 
                supports behind the battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed 
                to fire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right 
                of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command, 
                and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved 
                forward.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly 
                struck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, 
                was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.</p>
              <p> 　　The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their 
                long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. 
                A few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers 
                came back from that direction. Projectiles began to fall still 
                more frequently in the battery. Several men were lying about who 
                had not been removed. Around the cannon the men moved still more 
                briskly and busily. No one any longer took notice of Pierre. Once 
                or twice he was shouted at for being in the way. The senior officer 
                moved with big, rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning 
                face. The young officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded 
                the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the 
                charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained 
                smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they 
                were on springs.</p>
              <p> 　　The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire 
                which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing 
                beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to 
                his shako, ran up to his superior.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds 
                are left. Are we to continue firing?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grapeshot!&quot; the senior shouted, without answering 
                the question, looking over the wall of the trench.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp 
                and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on 
                the wing. Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre's 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, 
                a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds 
                before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers 
                shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; were running not forwards but backwards, 
                it seemed to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which 
                he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed 
                before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. 
                Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All with grapeshot!&quot; shouted the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper 
                informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there 
                is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The scoundrels! What are they doing?&quot; shouted the 
                officer, turning to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer's face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered 
                under his frowning brow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!&quot; 
                he yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking 
                to his men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite 
                side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't fire.... Wait!&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled 
                against Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, sir, this is no place for you,&quot; said he, and 
                ran down the slope.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer 
                was sitting.</p>
              <p> 　　One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling 
                in front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. &quot;Where 
                am I going?&quot; he suddenly asked himself when he was already 
                near the green ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not 
                knowing whether to return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion 
                threw him backwards to the ground. At the same instant he was 
                dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a deafening 
                roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.</p>
              <p> 　　When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning 
                on his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no 
                longer existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the 
                scorched grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind 
                it, galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the 
                ground, uttering prolonged and piercing cries.</p>

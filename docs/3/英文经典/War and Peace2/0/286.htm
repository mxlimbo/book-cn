              <p> 　　Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from 
                the front, but Kutuzov accompanied that column. He well knew that 
                nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against 
                his will, and as far as was in his power held the troops back. 
                He did not advance.</p>
              <p> 　　He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering 
                suggestions that they should attack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don't 
                see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers,&quot; 
                said he to Miloradovich who asked permission to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morning or get 
                to the place in time, and nothing can be done now!&quot; he replied 
                to someone else.</p>
              <p> 　　When Kutuzov was informed that at the French rear- where according 
                to the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody- 
                there were now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance 
                at Ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since 
                the previous day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see! They are asking to attack and making plans 
                of all kinds, but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, 
                and the enemy, forewarned, takes measures accordingly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing 
                these words. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, 
                and that Kutuzov would content himself with that hint.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's having a little fun at my expense,&quot; said Ermolov 
                softly, nudging with his knee Raevski who was at his side.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully 
                remarked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is not too late yet, your Highness- the enemy has 
                not gone away- if you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards 
                will not so much as see a little smoke.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that 
                Murat's troops were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at 
                every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov's Cossacks 
                had done: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men 
                uselessly.</p>
              <p> 　　In consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration, 
                and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others 
                also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various 
                grades, and following the battle fresh changes were made in the 
                staff.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!&quot; 
                said the Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, 
                letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things 
                all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so, just 
                as people speak today. But people who talk like that either do 
                not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves. 
                No battle- Tarutino, Borodino, or Austerlitz- takes place as those 
                who planned it anticipated. That is an essential condition.</p>
              <p> 　　A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer 
                than during a battle, where it is a question of life and death) 
                influence the course taken by the fight, and that course never 
                can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction 
                of any one force.</p>
              <p> 　　If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on 
                a given body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with 
                any one of those forces, but will always be a mean- what in mechanics 
                is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.</p>
              <p> 　　If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French 
                ones, we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance 
                with previously formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn 
                is that those descriptions are false.</p>
              <p> 　　The battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll 
                had in view- to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed 
                by the dispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have 
                had in view- to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately 
                destroying the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have 
                had in view; nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into 
                action to distinguish himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted 
                more booty than he got, and so on. But if the aim of the battle 
                was what actually resulted and what all the Russians of that day 
                desired- to drive the French out of Russia and destroy their army- 
                it is quite clear that the battle of Tarutino, just because of 
                its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage of 
                the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine 
                any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. 
                With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the 
                greatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign 
                were attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure 
                of the weakness of the French, and the administration of that 
                shock which Napoleon's army had only awaited to begin its flight.

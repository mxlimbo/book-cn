              <p> 　　 Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent 
                on time, can relate to a whole series of events occurring over 
                a period of years or centuries, and only the Deity, independent 
                of everything, can by His sole will determine the direction of 
                humanity's movement; but man acts in time and himself takes part 
                in what occurs.</p>
              <p> 　　Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we 
                see that no command can be executed without some preceding order 
                having been given rendering the execution of the last command 
                possible.</p>
              <p> 　　No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a 
                whole series of occurrences; but each command follows from another, 
                and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one 
                moment only of an event.</p>
              <p> 　　When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to 
                go to war, we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series 
                of consecutive commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could 
                not have commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today 
                he ordered such and such papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, 
                and to Petersburg; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to 
                the army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so on and so on- millions 
                of commands, which formed a whole series corresponding to a series 
                of events which brought the French armies into Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning 
                an invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so 
                much time and effort, and yet during his whole reign never once 
                attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into 
                Russia, with which country he considered it desirable to be in 
                alliance (a conviction he repeatedly expressed)- this came about 
                because his commands did not correspond to the course of events 
                in the first case, but did so correspond in the latter.</p>
              <p> 　　For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that 
                a man should order what can be executed. But to know what can 
                and what cannot be executed is impossible, not only in the case 
                of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in which millions participated, 
                but even in the simplest event, for in either case millions of 
                obstacles may arise to prevent its execution. Every order executed 
                is always one of an immense number unexecuted. All the impossible 
                orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted. 
                Only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series 
                of commands corresponding to a series of events, and are executed.</p>
              <p> 　　Our false conception that an event is caused by a command 
                which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken 
                place and out of thousands of others those few commands which 
                were consistent with that event have been executed, we forget 
                about the others that were not executed because they could not 
                be. Apart from that, the chief source of our error in this matter 
                is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series 
                of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such for instance as 
                all those which led the French armies to Russia, is generalized 
                into one event in accord with the result produced by that series 
                of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole 
                series of commands is also generalized into a single expression 
                of will.</p>
              <p> 　　We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. 
                In reality in all Napoleon's activity we never find anything resembling 
                an expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions 
                of his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a 
                long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon's one series, for 
                the campaign of 1812, was carried out- not because those orders 
                differed in any way from the other, unexecuted orders but because 
                they coincided with the course of events that led the French army 
                into Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes 
                out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that 
                way, but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure 
                cut in the stencil.</p>
              <p> 　　So that examining the relation in time of the commands to 
                the events, we find that a command can never be the cause of the 
                event, but that a certain definite dependence exists between the 
                two.</p>
              <p> 　　To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary 
                to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding 
                not from the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who 
                gives the command himself takes part in</p>
              <p> 　　This relation of the commander to those he commands is just 
                what is called power. This relation consists in the following:</p>
              <p> 　　For common action people always unite in certain combinations, 
                in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the 
                common action, the relation between those taking part in it is 
                always the same.</p>
              <p> 　　Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations 
                toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share, 
                and the smaller number a less direct share, in the collective 
                action for which they have combined.</p>
              <p> 　　Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective 
                action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army.</p>
              <p> 　　Every army is composed of lower grades of the service- the 
                rank and file- of whom there are always the greatest number; of 
                the next higher military rank- corporals and noncommissioned officers 
                of whom there are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom 
                there are still fewer, and so on to the highest military command 
                which is concentrated in one person.</p>
              <p> 　　A military organization may be quite correctly compared to 
                a cone, of which the base with the largest diameter consists of 
                the rank and file; the next higher and smaller section of the 
                cone consists of the next higher grades of the army, and so on 
                to the apex, the point of which will represent the commander in 
                chief.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section 
                of the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, 
                hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for 
                these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order. 
                The noncommissioned officers (of whom there are fewer) perform 
                the action itself less frequently than the soldiers, but they 
                already give commands. An officer still less often acts directly 
                himself, but commands still more frequently. A general does nothing 
                but command the troops, indicates the objective, and hardly ever 
                uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief never takes direct 
                part in the action itself, but only gives general orders concerning 
                the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar relation of 
                people to one another is seen in every combination of men for 
                common activity- in agriculture, trade, and every administration.</p>
              <p> 　　And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections 
                of a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions 
                in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest 
                to the highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated 
                action, combine in such relations that the more directly they 
                participate in performing the action the less they can command 
                and the more numerous they are, while the less their direct participation 
                in the action itself, the more they command and the fewer of them 
                there are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man 
                at the top, who takes the least direct share in the action and 
                directs his activity chiefly to commanding.</p>
              <p> 　　This relation of the men who command to those they command 
                is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power.</p>
              <p> 　　Having restored the condition of time under which all events 
                occur, find that a command is executed only when it is related 
                to a corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition 
                of relation between those who command and those who execute, we 
                find that by the very nature of the case those who command take 
                the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity 
                is exclusively directed to commanding.</p>

              <p> 　　 For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, 
                history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in 
                which the question is dealt with, that for history this question 
                does not refer to the essence of man's free will but its manifestation 
                in the past and under certain conditions.</p>
              <p> 　　In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences 
                as experimental science stands to abstract science.</p>
              <p> 　　The subject for history is not man's will itself but our presentation 
                of it.</p>
              <p> 　　And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the 
                incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist 
                as it does for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys 
                a presentation of man's life in which the union of these two contradictions 
                has already taken place.</p>
              <p> 　　In actual life each historic event, each human action, is 
                very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, 
                although each event presents itself as partly free and partly 
                compulsory.</p>
              <p> 　　To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined 
                and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the 
                philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to 
                that taken by other sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions 
                of freedom and inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the 
                phenomena of life under those definitions, history should deduce 
                a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves 
                from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant 
                and that always appear dependent on these two elements.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an 
                individual we may consider, we always regard it as the result 
                partly of man's free will and partly of the law of inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions 
                of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone's 
                action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for 
                his walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree 
                of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people 
                is clearly defined for us.</p>
              <p> 　　Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according 
                to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, 
                but every human action appears to us as a certain combination 
                of freedom and inevitability. In every action we examine we see 
                a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. 
                And always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability 
                do we perceive, and the more inevitability the less freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases 
                according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, 
                but their relation is always one of inverse proportion.</p>
              <p> 　　A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a 
                hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; 
                or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command 
                kills a defenseless man- seem less guilty, that is, less free 
                and more subject to the law of necessity, to one who knows the 
                circumstances in which these people were placed, and more free 
                to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning, that 
                the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks, and 
                so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago 
                and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems 
                less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability, 
                to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed 
                than to one who examined it the day after it was committed. And 
                in the same way every action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly 
                excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows 
                the mental condition of him who committed the action, and seems 
                more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it. In 
                all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished 
                and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased 
                or increased, according to the point of view from which the action 
                is regarded. So that the greater the conception of necessity the 
                smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.</p>
              <p> 　　Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence, 
                and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity 
                and freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom 
                and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:</p>
              <p> 　　(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits 
                the deeds.</p>
              <p> 　　(2) His relation to time.</p>
              <p> 　　(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.</p>
              <p> 　　The first consideration is the clearness of our perception 
                of the man's relation to the external world and the greater or 
                lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position 
                occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with 
                him. This is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less 
                free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground, 
                and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others 
                in a thickly populated district, or of one bound by family, official, 
                or business duties, seem certainly less free and more subject 
                to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion.</p>
              <p> 　　If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything 
                around him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see 
                his relation to anything around him, if we see his connection 
                with anything whatever- with a man who speaks to him, a book he 
                reads, the work on which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes 
                or the light that falls on the things about him- we see that each 
                of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at 
                least some side of his activity. And the more we perceive of these 
                influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and 
                the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.</p>
              <p> 　　The second consideration is the more or less evident time 
                relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception 
                of the place the man's action occupies in time. That is the ground 
                which makes the fall of the first man, resulting in the production 
                of the human race, appear evidently less free than a man's entry 
                into marriage today. It is the reason why the life and activity 
                of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in 
                time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary, 
                the consequences of which are still unknown to me.</p>
              <p> 　　The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends 
                in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between 
                the performance of the action and our judgment of it.</p>
              <p> 　　If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately 
                the same circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears 
                to me undoubtedly free. But if I examine an act performed a month 
                ago, then being in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing 
                that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from 
                it- good, agreeable, and even essential- would not have taken 
                place. If I reflect on an action still more remote, ten years 
                ago or more, then the consequences of my action are still plainer 
                to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had 
                that action not been performed. The farther I go back in memory, 
                or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment, 
                the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action.</p>
              <p> 　　In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning 
                the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. 
                A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of 
                all the known participants, but with a more remote event we already 
                see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything 
                else possible. And the farther we go back in examining events 
                the less arbitrary do they appear.</p>
              <p> 　　The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result 
                of the crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars 
                still seem to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome 
                of their heroes' will. But in the Crusades we already see an event 
                occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot 
                imagine the modern history of Europe, though to the chroniclers 
                of the Crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will 
                of certain people. In regard to the migration of the peoples it 
                does not enter anyone's head today to suppose that the renovation 
                of the European world depended on Attila's caprice. The farther 
                back in history the object of our observation lies, the more doubtful 
                does the free will of those concerned in the event become and 
                the more manifest the law of inevitability.</p>
              <p> 　　The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend 
                that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, 
                in which each phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man's every 
                action, must have its definite place as a result of what has gone 
                before and as a cause of what will follow.</p>
              <p> 　　The better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, 
                and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is 
                controlled, and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, 
                psychological, and historical causes of the action, and the simpler 
                the action we are observing and the less complex the character 
                and mind of the man in question, the more subject to inevitability 
                and the less free do our actions and those of others appear.</p>
              <p> 　　When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether 
                a crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we 
                ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime 
                we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act; in the 
                case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent 
                case we recognize in it more individuality, originality, and independence. 
                But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known 
                to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less 
                insistent on punishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment of 
                the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of the apparently 
                original action. That a criminal was reared among male factors 
                mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father 
                or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, 
                is more comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore 
                seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. 
                The founder of a sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less 
                when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity. 
                If we have a large range of examples, if our observation is constantly 
                directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people's 
                actions, their actions appear to us more under compulsion and 
                less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes. 
                If we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions 
                under observation, our conception of their inevitability would 
                be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest 
                father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company, 
                a drunkard's relapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that 
                seem to us less free the better we understand their cause. If 
                the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage 
                of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton- 
                then, knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the 
                character and intelligence in question, we see so large an element 
                of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the 
                cause prompting the action we can foretell the result.</p>
              <p> 　　On these three considerations alone is based the conception 
                of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances 
                admitted by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears 
                greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of 
                the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is 
                being judged, and according to the greater or lesser interval 
                of time between the commission of the action and its investigation, 
                and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes 
                that led to the action. </p>

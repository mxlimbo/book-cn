              <p> 　　Moscow's last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, 
                a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, 
                just as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited 
                the city.</p>
              <p> 　　Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow- 
                the rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. 
                An enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, 
                with whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, 
                had gone early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited 
                there for Rostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced 
                that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about 
                the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day 
                indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, 
                of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money 
                and city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances 
                of carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving 
                in payment a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were 
                fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and 
                bronzes were being given away for nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution 
                of former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to 
                the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge 
                retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; 
                and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts 
                that had come in from their estates and which many people envied 
                proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous 
                sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the 
                horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the 
                morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent 
                by wounded officers came to the Rostovs' and wounded men dragged 
                themselves there from the Rostovs' and from neighboring houses 
                where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to 
                get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties 
                were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely 
                refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the 
                count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident that 
                if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse 
                another, or all the carts and one's own carriages as well. Thirty 
                carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe 
                one could not disregard oneself and one's own family. So thought 
                the major-domo on his master's behalf.</p>
              <p> 　　On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom 
                softly, so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only 
                toward morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing 
                gown. In the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages 
                were at the front porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking 
                to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged 
                arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made a significant and 
                stern gesture to them both to go away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?&quot; asked the 
                count, and stroking his bald head he looked good-naturedly at 
                the officer and the orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see 
                new faces.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We can harness at once, your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, that's right. As soon as the countess wakes we'll 
                be off, God willing! What is it, gentlemen?&quot; he added, turning 
                to the officer. &quot;Are you staying in my house?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count, be so good as to allow me... for God's sake, 
                to get into some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here 
                with me.... I shall be all right on a loaded cart...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made 
                the same request on behalf of his master.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, yes,yes!&quot; said the count hastily. &quot;I 
                shall be very pleased, very pleased. Vasilich, you'll see to it. 
                Just unload one or two carts. Well, what of it... do what's necessary...&quot; 
                said the count, muttering some indefinite order.</p>
              <p> 　　But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on 
                the officer's face had already sealed the order. The count looked 
                around him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, 
                wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were 
                all looking at the count and moving toward the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please step into the gallery, your excellency,&quot; 
                said the major-domo. &quot;What are your orders about the pictures?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The count went into the house with him, repeating his order 
                not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,&quot; 
                he added in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being 
                overheard.</p>
              <p> 　　At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, 
                who had been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed 
                a sort of chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame 
                Schoss was much offended and the young ladies' summer dresses 
                could not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that 
                Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down 
                from its cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage 
                taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count 
                in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take 
                with them. The countess sent for her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being 
                unloaded.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... 
                an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. 
                After all, ours are things that can be bought but think what being 
                left behind means to them!... Really now, in our own yard- we 
                asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them.... 
                You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where's the 
                hurry?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of 
                money matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor 
                of news of something detrimental to the children's interests, 
                such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration 
                of a private theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always 
                to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered 
                it her duty to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her 
                husband: &quot;Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so 
                that we are getting nothing for the house, and now you wish to 
                throw away all our- all the children's property! You said yourself 
                that we have a hundred thousand rubles' worth of things in the 
                house. I don't consent, my dear, I don't! Do as you please! It's 
                the government's business to look after the wounded; they know 
                that. Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they cleared out everything 
                two days ago. That's what other people do. It's only we who are 
                such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the children.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without 
                replying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa, what are you doing that for?&quot; asked Natasha, 
                who had followed him into her mother's room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing! What business is it of yours?&quot; muttered 
                the count angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I heard,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Why does Mamma 
                object?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What business is it of yours?&quot; cried the count.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us,&quot; said she, 
                looking out of the window.</p>

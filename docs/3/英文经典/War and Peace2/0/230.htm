                human mind. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to 
                man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that 
                motion; but at the same time, a large proportion of human error 
                comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous 
                elements. There is a well known, so-called sophism of the ancients 
                consisting in this, that Achilles could never catch up with a 
                tortoise he was following, in spite of the fact that he traveled 
                ten times as fast as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered 
                the distance that separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise 
                has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him: when Achilles 
                has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, 
                and so on forever. This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. 
                The absurd answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) 
                resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous 
                elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise 
                was continuous.</p>
              <p> 　　By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only 
                approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when 
                we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the 
                resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth, 
                and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we 
                reach a solution of the problem.</p>
              <p> 　　A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of 
                dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other 
                more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.</p>
              <p> 　　This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, 
                when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of 
                the infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of 
                motion (absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable 
                error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate 
                elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion.</p>
              <p> 　　In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing 
                happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable 
                arbitrary human wills, is continuous.</p>
              <p> 　　To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the 
                aim of history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the 
                sum of all those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary 
                and disconnected units. The first method of history is to take 
                an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine 
                it apart from others, though there is and can be no beginning 
                to any event, for one event always flows uninterruptedly from 
                another.</p>
              <p> 　　The second method is to consider the actions of some one man- 
                a king or a commander- as equivalent to the sum of many individual 
                wills; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed 
                by the activity of a single historic personage.</p>
              <p> 　　Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth 
                continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But 
                however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit 
                disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, 
                or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions 
                of any one historic personage, is in itself false.</p>
              <p> 　　It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any 
                deductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select 
                some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation- as 
                criticism has every right to do, seeing that whatever unit history 
                observes must always be arbitrarily selected.</p>
              <p> 　　Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation 
                (the differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies 
                of men) and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, 
                finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive 
                at the laws of history.</p>
              <p> 　　The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe 
                present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave 
                their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the 
                other, plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged 
                in despair, and for some years the whole course of life is altered 
                and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then 
                slackens. What was the cause of this movement, by what laws was 
                it governed? asks the mind of man.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the 
                sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city 
                of Paris, calling these sayings and doings &quot;the Revolution&quot;; 
                then they give a detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain 
                people favorable or hostile to him; tell of the influence some 
                of these people had on others, and say: that is why this movement 
                took place and those are its laws.</p>
              <p> 　　But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, 
                but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, 
                because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. 
                The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and 
                only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But every time there have been conquests there have 
                been conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any 
                state there have been great men,&quot; says history. And, indeed, 
                human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have 
                been wars, but this does not prove that the conquerors caused 
                the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in 
                the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch 
                and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring 
                church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of 
                the clock reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement 
                of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch.</p>
              <p> 　　Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle 
                and see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right 
                to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the 
                cause of the movement of the engine.</p>
              <p> 　　The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because 
                the oaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow 
                when the oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes 
                the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree 
                with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause 
                of the cold wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence 
                of the buds. I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens 
                with all the phenomena of life, and I see that however much and 
                however carefully I observe the hands of the watch, and the valves 
                and wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the 
                cause of the bells ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds 
                of spring. To that I must entirely change my point of view and 
                study the laws of the movement of steam, of the bells, and of 
                the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this direction 
                have already been made.</p>
              <p> 　　To study the laws of history we must completely change the 
                subject of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, 
                and generals, and the common, infinitesimally small elements by 
                which the masses are moved. No one can say in how far it is possible 
                for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the 
                laws of history; but it is evident that only along that path does 
                the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie, and that 
                as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied 
                in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing 
                the actions of various kings, commanders, and ministers and propounding 
                the historians' own reflections concerning these actions.</p>

              <p> 　　On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon 
                remarked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to 
                talk to him about Paris and about some changes he meant to make 
                the Empress' household, surprising the prefect by his memory of 
                minute details relating to the court.</p>
              <p> 　　He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset's 
                love of travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident 
                surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and 
                putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the 
                operating table. &quot;The matter is in my hands and is clear 
                and definite in my head. When the times comes to set to work I 
                shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and the 
                more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident 
                you ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to 
                rest before the serious business which, he considered, awaited 
                him next day. He was so much interested in that task that he was 
                unable to sleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse 
                from the dampness of the evening, he went into the large division 
                of the tent at three o'clock in the morning, loudly blowing his 
                nose. He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and was 
                told that the enemy's fires were still in the same places. He 
                nodded approval.</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?&quot; 
                Napoleon asked him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Without doubt, sire,&quot; replied Rapp.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon looked at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to 
                say at Smolensk?&quot; continued Rapp. &quot;The wine is drawn 
                and must be drunk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his 
                head on his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This poor army!&quot; he suddenly remarked. &quot;It 
                has diminished greatly since Smolensk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, 
                Rapp. I have always said so and I am beginning to experience it. 
                But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are intact?&quot; he remarked 
                interrogatively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; replied Rapp.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced 
                at his watch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. 
                It was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing 
                time, for the orders had all been given and were now being executed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments 
                of the Guards?&quot; asked Napoleon sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The rice too?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor's order about the 
                rice, but Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not 
                believing that his order had been executed. An attendant came 
                in with punch. Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for 
                Rapp, and silently sipped his own.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have neither taste nor smell,&quot; he remarked, sniffing 
                at his glass. &quot;This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine- 
                what is the good of medicine when it can't cure a cold! Corvisart 
                gave me these lozenges but they don't help at all. What can doctors 
                cure? One can't cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. 
                It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in 
                it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if 
                you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like 
                a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; watchmaker 
                cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... 
                Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And having entered on the path of definition, of which he 
                was fond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?&quot; asked 
                he. &quot;It is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a 
                given moment. That's all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rapp made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov!&quot; said 
                Napoleon. &quot;We shall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded 
                an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect 
                his entrenchments.... We shall see!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked at his watch. It was still only four o'clock. He 
                did not feel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still 
                nothing to do. He rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat 
                and a hat, and went out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, 
                a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above. Near 
                by, the campfires were dimly burning among the French Guards, 
                and in the distance those of the Russian line shone through the 
                smoke. The weather was calm, and the rustle and tramp of the French 
                troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were 
                clearly audible.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the 
                fires and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall 
                guardsman in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his 
                tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of 
                the Emperor, Napoleon stopped in front of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What year did you enter the service?&quot; he asked 
                with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with 
                which he always addressed the soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　The man answered the question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It has, Your Majesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon nodded and walked away. </p>
              <p> 　　At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevardino.</p>
              <p> 　　It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single 
                cloud lay in the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves 
                out in the faint morning light.</p>
              <p> 　　On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and 
                died away in the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second 
                and a third report shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed 
                solemnly near by on the right.</p>
              <p> 　　The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others 
                rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking 
                one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevardino Redoubt 
                where he dismounted. The game had begun.</p>

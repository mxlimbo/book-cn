              <p> 　　Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner 
                and though the French had offered to move him from the men's to 
                the officers' shed, he had stayed in the shed where he was first 
                put.</p>
              <p> 　　In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost 
                the extreme limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to 
                his physical strength and health, of which he had till then been 
                unconscious, and thanks especially to the fact that the privations 
                came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began, 
                he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And just 
                at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he 
                had formerly striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different 
                ways that tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so 
                impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Borodino. He had 
                sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations 
                of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and 
                in romantic love for Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning- and 
                all these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without 
                thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only 
                through the horror of death, through privation, and through what 
                he recognized in Karataev.</p>
              <p> 　　Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions 
                had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory 
                the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so 
                important. It did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or 
                the war, or politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all 
                these things were no business of his, and that he was not called 
                on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so. &quot;Russia 
                and summer weather are not bound together,&quot; he thought, repeating 
                words of Karataev's which he found strangely consoling. His intention 
                of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number 
                of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and 
                even ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his 
                name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but 
                even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or other 
                that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter 
                to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out 
                that their prisoner's name was Count Bezukhov?</p>
              <p> 　　He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew 
                and quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew's 
                thoughts somewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said 
                that happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a 
                shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that 
                all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to 
                torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without 
                any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction 
                of one's needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one's occupation, 
                that is, of one's way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably 
                man's highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully 
                appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking 
                when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of 
                warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished 
                to talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one's needs- 
                good food, cleanliness, and freedom- now that he was deprived 
                of all this, seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; 
                and the choice of occupation, that is, of his way of life- now 
                that that was so restricted- seemed to him such an easy matter 
                that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys 
                all joy in satisfying one's needs, while great freedom in the 
                choice of occupation- such freedom as his wealth, his education, 
                and his social position had given him in his own life- is just 
                what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys 
                the desire and possibility of having an occupation.</p>
              <p> 　　All Pierre's daydreams now turned on the time when he would 
                be free. Yet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought 
                and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those 
                irrecoverable, strong, joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete 
                peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during 
                those weeks.</p>
              <p> 　　When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed 
                at dawn, and saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of 
                the Virgin still dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, 
                the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded banks above the winding river 
                vanishing in the purple distance, when he felt the contact of 
                the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from Moscow 
                across the field, and when afterwards light gleamed from the east 
                and the sun's rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud, and the 
                cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the river, 
                all began to sparkle in the glad light- Pierre felt a new joy 
                and strength in life such as he had never before known. And this 
                not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, 
                but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased.</p>
              <p> 　　That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was 
                still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow 
                prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With 
                his knowledge of languages, the respect shown him by the French, 
                his simplicity, his readiness to give anything asked of him (he 
                received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers); 
                with his strength, which he showed to the soldiers by pressing 
                nails into the walls of the hut; his gentleness to his companions, 
                and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing 
                anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible), he appeared 
                to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very qualities 
                that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in 
                the world he had lived in- his strength, his disdain for the comforts 
                of life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity- here among these 
                people gave him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that 
                their opinion placed responsibilities upon him.</p>

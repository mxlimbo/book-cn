              <p> 　　Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sonya and the count 
                tried to replace Natasha but could not. They saw that she alone 
                was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For 
                three weeks Natasha remained constantly at her mother's side, 
                sleeping on a lounge chair in her room, making her eat and drink, 
                and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, 
                caressing tones soothed her mother.</p>
              <p> 　　The mother's wounded spirit could not could not heal. Petya's 
                death had torn from her half her life. When the news of Petya's 
                death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, 
                but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking 
                no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the 
                countess, this second blow, restored Natasha to life.</p>
              <p> 　　A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body 
                is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as 
                a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual 
                wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital 
                force from within.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's wound healed in that way. She thought her life was 
                ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that 
                the essence of life- love- was still active within her. Love awoke 
                and so did life.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha 
                together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. 
                Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked 
                after Natasha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks 
                passed in her mother's bedroom had strained Natasha's physical 
                strength.</p>
              <p> 　　One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess 
                Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. 
                Natasha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds 
                and was going away she called her back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are tired- try to sleep.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking 
                for me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is much better. She spoke so well today,&quot; said 
                Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room 
                scanned Princess Mary's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is she like him?&quot; thought Natasha. &quot;Yes, like 
                and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and 
                unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. 
                But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? 
                Yes, she is splendid!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary,&quot; she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary's 
                hand to herself, &quot;Mary, you mustn't think me wicked. No? 
                Mary darling, how I love you! Let us be quite, quite friends.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, 
                making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration 
                of her feelings.</p>
              <p> 　　From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists 
                only between women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha. 
                They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one 
                another and spent most of their time together. When one went out 
                the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together 
                they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them 
                felt with herself when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship 
                sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible 
                only in each other's presence.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they 
                were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. 
                They spoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of 
                her childhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams; and 
                Natasha, who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly 
                turned away from that life of devotion, submission, and the poetry 
                of Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to Princess 
                Mary by affection, learned to love her past too and to understand 
                a side of life previously incomprehensible to her. She did not 
                think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, 
                for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood 
                and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. 
                For Princess Mary, listening to Natasha's tales of childhood and 
                early youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended 
                side of life: belief in life and its enjoyment.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower 
                (as they thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence 
                about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget 
                him without being conscious of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that 
                they all talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes 
                she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, 
                weakness, and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined 
                her bare arm carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the 
                morning noticed her drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face 
                in her glass. It seemed to her that things must be so, and yet 
                it was dreadfully sad.</p>
              <p> 　　One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of 
                breath. Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going 
                down, and then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing 
                the result.</p>
              <p> 　　Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, 
                so she called again- though she could hear Dunyasha coming- called 
                her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, 
                sing, and listened attentively to herself.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath 
                the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, 
                delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking 
                root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed 
                her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The 
                wound had begun to heal from within.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the 
                count insisted on Natasha's going with her to consult the doctors.</p>

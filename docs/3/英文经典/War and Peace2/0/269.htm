              <p> 　　On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov, Princess 
                Mary had found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from 
                Prince Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva 
                at Voronezh. That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented 
                her during her father's illness, since his death, and especially 
                since her meeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for 
                the journey, anxiety about her brother, settling in a new house, 
                meeting new people, and attending to her nephew's education. She 
                was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet surroundings, she 
                felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated 
                in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly 
                tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother, the 
                only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was 
                worried too about her nephew's education for which she had always 
                felt herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt 
                at peace- a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled 
                those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of 
                awakening within her and were related to her meeting with Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　The day after her party the governor's wife came to see Malvintseva 
                and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though 
                under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, 
                not to be thought of, all the same the young people might be brought 
                together and could get to know one another. Malvintseva expressed 
                approval, and the governor's wife began to speak of Rostov in 
                Mary's presence, praising him and telling how he had blushed when 
                Princess Mary's name was mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced 
                a painful rather than a joyful feeling- her mental tranquillity 
                was destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.</p>
              <p> 　　During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess 
                Mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First 
                she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to 
                see her aunt- that it would not be proper for her, in her deep 
                mourning, to receive visitors; then she thought this would be 
                rude after what he had done for her; then it occurred to her that 
                her aunt and the governor's wife had intentions concerning herself 
                and Rostov- their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this 
                supposition- then she told herself that only she, with her sinful 
                nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that situated 
                as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking 
                would be an insult to her and to her father's memory. Assuming 
                that she did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words 
                he would say to her and what she would say to him, and these words 
                sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. 
                More than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might 
                overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him.</p>
              <p> 　　But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the 
                drawing room that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed 
                no confusion, only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her 
                eyes lit up with a new and radiant light.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have met him, Aunt?&quot; said she in a calm voice, 
                unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm 
                and natural.</p>
              <p> 　　When Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes 
                for an instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, 
                and then just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and 
                met his look with shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity 
                and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her 
                slender, delicate hand to him, and began to speak in a voice in 
                which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, who was in the drawing room, looked at Princess Mary 
                in bewildered surprise. Herself a consummate coquette, she could 
                not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Either black is particularly becoming to her or she 
                really has greatly improved without my having noticed it. And 
                above all, what tact and grace!&quot; thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, 
                she would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                at the change that had taken place in herself. From the moment 
                she recognized that dear, loved face, a new life force took possession 
                of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. 
                From the time Rostov entered, her face became suddenly transformed. 
                It was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted 
                lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, 
                that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly 
                shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time 
                all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had 
                lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction 
                with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her 
                meekness, love, and self-sacrifice- all this now shone in those 
                radiant eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her 
                gentle face.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole 
                life. He felt that the being before him was quite different from, 
                and better than, anyone he had met before, and above all better 
                than himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke 
                of the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their 
                sorrow about it; they spoke of their last meeting- Nicholas trying 
                to change the subject- they talked of the governor's kind wife, 
                of Nicholas' relations, and of Princess Mary's.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation 
                as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak 
                of Russia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her 
                brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would 
                speak lightly of him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every 
                shade of Princess Mary's character with an observation unusual 
                to him, and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a 
                quite unusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was 
                confused when people spoke to him about the princess (as she did 
                when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of her, but in 
                her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what he 
                had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at 
                the moment.</p>
              <p> 　　When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as 
                is usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew's little 
                son, caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. 
                He took the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round 
                at Princess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched 
                the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also 
                noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure 
                and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.</p>
              <p> 　　As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, 
                and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; 
                but all the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking, 
                passing on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said 
                of him and vice versa, and insisting on his declaring himself 
                to Princess Mary. For this purpose she arranged a meeting between 
                the young people at the bishop's house before Mass.</p>
              <p> 　　Though Rostov told the governeor's wife that he would not 
                make any declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.</p>
              <p> 　　As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that 
                what everybody considered right was right, so now, after a short 
                but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by 
                his own sense of justice, and in obedient submission to circumstances, 
                he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly 
                carrying him he knew not where. He knew that after his promise 
                to Sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings 
                to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. 
                But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that 
                by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to 
                those who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, 
                but was doing something very important- more important than anything 
                he had ever done in his life.</p>
              <p> 　　After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life 
                went on externally as before, all his former amusements lost their 
                charm for him and he often thought about her. But he never thought 
                about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception 
                whom he had met in society, nor as he had for a long time, and 
                at one time rapturously, thought about Sonya. He had pictured 
                each of those young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young 
                men do, that is, as a possible wife, adapting her in his imagination 
                to all the conditions of married life: a white dressing gown, 
                his wife at the tea table, his wife's carriage, little ones, Mamma 
                and Papa, their relations to her, and so on- and these pictures 
                of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary, 
                to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture 
                anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed 
                incongruous and false. It made him afraid. </p>

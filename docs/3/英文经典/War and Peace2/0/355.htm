              <p> 　　 What force moves the nations?</p>
              <p> 　　Biographical historians and historians of separate nations 
                understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. 
                In their narration events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, 
                and Alexander, or in general of the persons they describe. The 
                answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what 
                force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as 
                there is but one historian to each event. As soon as historians 
                of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the 
                same event, the replies they give immediately lose all meaning, 
                for this force is understood by them all not only differently 
                but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that 
                an event was produced by Napoleon's power, another that it was 
                produced by Alexander's, a third that it was due to the power 
                of some other person. Besides this, historians of that kind contradict 
                each other even in their statement as to the force on which the 
                authority of some particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, 
                says that Napoleon's power was based on his virtue and genius. 
                Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was based on his trickery and deception 
                of the people. So the historians of this class, by mutually destroying 
                one another's positions, destroy the understanding of the force 
                which produces events, and furnish no reply to history's essential 
                question.</p>
              <p> 　　Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations 
                seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians' 
                view of the force which produces events. They do not recognize 
                it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers, but as the resultant 
                of a multiplicity of variously directed forces. In describing 
                a war or the subjugation of a people, a general historian looks 
                for the cause of the event not in the power of one man, but in 
                the interaction of many persons connected with the event.</p>
              <p> 　　According to this view the power of historical personages, 
                represented as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would 
                seem, be regarded as a force that itself produces events. Yet 
                in most cases universal historians still employ the conception 
                of power as a force that itself produces events, and treat it 
                as their cause. In their exposition, an historic character is 
                first the product of his time, and his power only the resultant 
                of various forces, and then his power is itself a force producing 
                events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one 
                time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the 
                ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the 
                campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply 
                the product of Napoleon's misdirected will, and that the very 
                ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon's 
                caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of 
                the age produced Napoleon's power. But Napoleon's power suppressed 
                the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age.</p>
              <p> 　　This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does 
                it occur at every step, but the universal historians' accounts 
                are all made up of a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction 
                occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal 
                historians stop halfway.</p>
              <p> 　　To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant 
                force, the sum of the components must equal the resultant. This 
                condition is never observed by the universal historians, and so 
                to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit, in 
                addition to the insufficient components, another unexplained force 
                affecting the resultant action.</p>
              <p> 　　Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the 
                restoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were 
                produced by the will of Alexander. But the universal historian 
                Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries 
                to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the 
                Bourbons were due to other things beside Alexander's will- such 
                as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, 
                Fichte Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently decomposes 
                Alexander's power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, 
                and the rest- but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions 
                of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the others, 
                evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon 
                of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, 
                Madame de Stael, and others spoke certain words to one another 
                only affected their mutual relations but does not account for 
                the submission of millions. And therefore to explain how from 
                these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people 
                resulted- that is, how component forces equal to one A gave a 
                resultant equal to a thousand times A- the historian is again 
                obliged to fall back on power- the force he had denied- and to 
                recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he has to 
                admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is 
                just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not 
                only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according 
                to whether they want rain or fine weather: &quot;The wind has 
                blown the clouds away,&quot; or, &quot;The wind has brought up 
                the clouds.&quot; And in the same way the universal historians 
                sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with their theory, 
                say that power is the result of events, and sometimes, when they 
                want to prove something else, say that power produces events.</p>
              <p> 　　A third class of historians- the so-called historians of culture- 
                following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes 
                accept writers and ladies as forces producing events- again take 
                that force to be something quite different. They see it in what 
                is called culture- in mental activity.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to 
                their progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if 
                historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons 
                treated one another in such and such ways, why not explain them 
                by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books? 
                Of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital 
                phenomenon, these historians select the indication of intellectual 
                activity and say that this indication is the cause. But despite 
                their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual 
                activity, only by a great stretch can one admit that there is 
                any connection between intellectual activity and the movement 
                of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity 
                controls people's actions, for that view is not confirmed by such 
                facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting 
                from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars 
                and executions resulting from the preaching of love.</p>
              <p> 　　But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments 
                with which these histories are filled- admitting that nations 
                are governed by some undefined force called an idea- history's 
                essential question still remains unanswered, and to the former 
                power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people 
                introduced by the universal historians, another, newer force- 
                the idea- is added, the connection of which with the masses needs 
                explanation. It is possible to understand that Napoleon had power 
                and so events occurred; with some effort one may even conceive 
                that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause of 
                an event; but how a book, Le Contrat social, had the effect of 
                making Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood 
                without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with 
                the event.</p>
              <p> 　　Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously, 
                and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual 
                activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a 
                connection may be found between the movements of humanity and 
                commerce, handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. 
                But why intellectual activity is considered by the historians 
                of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical 
                movement is hard to understand. Only the following considerations 
                can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1) that history 
                is written by learned men, and so it is natural and agreeable 
                for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the 
                basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar belief 
                is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers 
                (if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and 
                soldiers do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, 
                enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, 
                indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use 
                words having a still less definite meaning, and which can therefore 
                be readily introduced into any theory.</p>
              <p> 　　But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of 
                this kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) 
                the histories of culture, to which all general histories tend 
                more and more to approximate, are significant from the fact that 
                after seriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, 
                and political doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have 
                to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 
                for instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from 
                an exercise of power- and say plainly that that was the result 
                of Napoleon's will. Speaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily 
                contradict themselves, and show that the new force they have devised 
                does not account for what happens in history, and that history 
                can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently 
                do not recognize. </p>

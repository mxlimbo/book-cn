              <p> 　　Having returned to the watchman's hut, Petya found Denisov 
                in the passage. He was awaiting Petya's return in a state of agitation, 
                anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Yes, thank God!&quot; 
                he repeated, listening to Petya's rapturous account. &quot;But, 
                devil take you, I haven't slept because of you! Well, thank God. 
                Now lie down. We can still get a nap before morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But... no,&quot; said Petya, &quot;I don't want to sleep 
                yet. Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep it's finished. And 
                then I am used to not sleeping before a battle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of 
                his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen 
                next day.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out 
                of doors.</p>
              <p> 　　It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops 
                were still falling from the trees. Near the watchman's hut the 
                black shapes of the Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered 
                together could be seen. Behind the hut the dark shapes of the 
                two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible, and 
                in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red. Not all the Cossacks 
                and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the sounds of falling 
                drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be heard low 
                voices which seemed to be whispering.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the 
                wagons. Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood 
                saddled horses munching their oats. In the dark Petya recognized 
                his own horse, which he called &quot;Karabakh&quot; though it 
                was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Karabakh! We'll do some service tomorrow,&quot; 
                said he, sniffing its nostrils and kissing it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why aren't you asleep, sir?&quot; said a Cossack who 
                was sitting under a wagon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, ah... Likhachev- isn't that your name? Do you know 
                I have only just come back! We've been into the French camp.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of 
                his ride but also of his object, and why he considered it better 
                to risk his life than to act &quot;just anyhow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you should get some sleep now,&quot; said the 
                Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I am used to this,&quot; said Petya. &quot;I say, 
                aren't the flints in your pistols worn out? I brought some with 
                me. Don't you want any? You can have some.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer 
                look at Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,&quot; 
                said Petya. &quot;Some fellows do things just anyhow, without 
                preparation, and then they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't 
                like that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just so,&quot; said the Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will 
                you sharpen my saber for me? It's got bl...&quot; (Petya feared 
                to tell a lie, and the saber never had been sharpened.) &quot;Can 
                you do it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course I can.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heard 
                the warlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon 
                and sat on its edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under 
                the wagon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say! Are the lads asleep?&quot; asked Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Some are, and some aren't- like us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and that boy?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vesenny? Oh, he's thrown himself down there in the passage. 
                Fast asleep after his fright. He was that glad!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After that Petya remained silent for a long time, listening 
                to the sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black 
                figure appeared.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you sharpening?&quot; asked a man coming up 
                to the wagon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, this gentleman's saber.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's right,&quot; said the man, whom Petya took to 
                be an hussar. &quot;Was the cup left here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, by the wheel!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hussar took the cup.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It must be daylight soon,&quot; said he, yawning, and 
                went away.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov's 
                guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon 
                captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that 
                under it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that 
                the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman's hut, and the 
                red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire, 
                that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted 
                a drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all 
                this. He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality. 
                The big dark blotch might really be the watchman's hut or it might 
                be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth. Perhaps the 
                red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an enormous monster. 
                Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might very well 
                be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower 
                from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day 
                or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. 
                Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who was sitting under 
                the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, 
                most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of. It might 
                really have been that the hussar came for water and went back 
                into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished- disappeared 
                altogether and dissolved into nothingness.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him. 
                He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like 
                the earth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds 
                were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked 
                as if the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. 
                Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes 
                the sky seemed to be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed 
                to sink so low that one could touch it with one's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya's eyes began to close and he swayed a little.</p>
              <p> 　　The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses 
                neighed and jostled one another. Someone snored.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...&quot; hissed the saber against 
                the whetstone, and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra 
                playing some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. Petya was as musical 
                as Natasha and more so than Nicholas, but had never learned music 
                or thought about it, and so the melody that unexpectedly came 
                to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive. The 
                music became more and more audible. The melody grew and passed 
                from one instrument to another. And what was played was a fugue- 
                though Petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is. 
                Each instrument- now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better 
                and clearer than violin or horn- played its own part, and before 
                it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that 
                began almost the same air, and then with a third and a fourth; 
                and they all blended into one and again became separate and again 
                blended, now into solemn church music, now into something dazzlingly 
                brilliant and triumphant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh- why, that was in a dream!&quot; Petya said to himself, 
                as he lurched forward. &quot;It's in my ears. But perhaps it's 
                music of my own. Well, go on, my music! Now!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, 
                sounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and 
                again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. &quot;Oh, 
                this is delightful! As much as I like and as I like!&quot; said 
                Petya to himself. He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now softly, softly die away!&quot; and the sounds obeyed 
                him. &quot;Now fuller, more joyful. Still more and more joyful!&quot; 
                And from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds. 
                &quot;Now voices join in!&quot; ordered Petya. And at first from 
                afar he heard men's voices and then women's. The voices grew in 
                harmonious triumphant strength, and Petya listened to their surpassing 
                beauty in awe and joy.</p>
              <p> 　　With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip 
                from the trees, and the hissing of the saber, &quot;Ozheg-zheg-zheg...&quot; 
                and again the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing 
                the choir but joining in it.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself 
                all the time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there 
                was no one to share it. He was awakened by Likhachev's kindly 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in 
                half with it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Petya woke up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's getting light, it's really getting light!&quot; 
                he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　The horses that had previously been invisible could now be 
                seen to their very tails, and a watery light showed itself through 
                the bare branches. Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble 
                from his pocket and gave it to Likhachev; then he flourished the 
                saber, tested it, and sheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their 
                horses and tightening their saddle girths.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And here's the commander,&quot; said Likhachev.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov came out of the watchman's hut and, having called 
                Petya, gave orders to get ready. </p>

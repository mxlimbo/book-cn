              <p> 　　The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical 
                progression; and that crossing of the Berezina about which so 
                much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, 
                and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much 
                has been and still is written about the Berezina, on the French 
                side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river 
                the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly 
                concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained 
                in every memory, and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg- 
                far from the seat of war- a plan (again one of Pfuel's) had been 
                devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Berezina 
                River. Everyone assured himself that all would happen according 
                to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing 
                of the Berezina that destroyed the French army. In reality the 
                results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French- 
                in guns and men lost- than Krasnoe had been, as the figures show.</p>
              <p> 　　The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in 
                the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of 
                all the plans for cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness 
                of the only possible line of action- the one Kutuzov and the general 
                mass of the army demanded- namely, simply to follow the enemy 
                up. The French crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and 
                all its energy was directed to reaching its goal. It fled like 
                a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path. This 
                was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing 
                as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges broke down, 
                unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with children who 
                were with the French transport, all- carried on by vis inertiae- 
                pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and 
                did not, surrender.</p>
              <p> 　　That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and 
                of pursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their 
                own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite 
                place he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining 
                in the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim 
                a share in the necessities of life. The French did not need to 
                be informed of the fact that half the prisoners- with whom the 
                Russians did not know what to do- perished of cold and hunger 
                despite their captors' desire to save them; they felt that it 
                could not be otherwise. The most compassionate Russian commanders, 
                those favorable to the French- and even the Frenchmen in the Russian 
                service- could do nothing for the prisoners. The French perished 
                from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself exposed. 
                It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and 
                indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, 
                or hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even 
                did that, but they were exceptions.</p>
              <p> 　　Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there 
                was hope. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation 
                save in collective flight, and on that the whole strength of the 
                French was concentrated.</p>
              <p> 　　The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight 
                of the remnant, especially after the Berezina, on which (in consequence 
                of the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, 
                and the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, blamed 
                one another and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure 
                of the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov 
                led to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more 
                strongly expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed 
                in a respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein 
                he was to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting 
                to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling 
                a regrettable formality, but they winked behind his back and tried 
                to mislead him at every turn.</p>
              <p> 　　Because they could not understand him all these people assumed 
                that it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never 
                grasp the profundity of their plans, that he would answer with 
                his phrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a &quot;golden 
                bridge,&quot; about the impossibility of crossing the frontier 
                with a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had heard 
                all that before. And all he said- that it was necessary to await 
                provisions, or that the men had no boots- was so simple, while 
                what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that it was 
                evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in 
                power, were commanders of genius.</p>
              <p> 　　After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral 
                and Petersburg hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of 
                the staff reached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed 
                and shrugged his shoulders. Only once, after the affair of the 
                Berezina, did he get angry and write to Bennigsen (who reported 
                separately to the Emperor) the following letter:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency 
                please be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this, 
                and there await further commands and appointments from His Imperial 
                Majesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand Duke Tsarevich 
                Constantine Pavlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the 
                beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from 
                the army by Kutuzov. Now having come to the army, he informed 
                Kutuzov of the Emperor's displeasure at the poor success of our 
                forces and the slowness of their advance. The Emperor intended 
                to join the army personally in a few days' time.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs- 
                this same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief 
                against the sovereign's wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke 
                and heir- apparent from the army- who on his own authority and 
                contrary to the Emperor's will had decided on the abandonment 
                of Moscow, now realized at once that his day was over, that his 
                part was played, and that the power he was supposed to hold was 
                no longer his. And he understood this not merely from the attitude 
                of the court. He saw on the one hand that the military business 
                in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission 
                was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious 
                of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity 
                of physical rest.</p>
              <p> 　　On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna- his 
                &quot;dear Vilna&quot; as he called it. Twice during his career 
                Kutuzov had been governor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which 
                had not been injured, he found old friends and associations, besides 
                the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived. And 
                he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and, as far 
                as the passions that seethed around him allowed, immersed himself 
                in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed, as 
                if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done 
                in the realm of history did not concern him at all.</p>
              <p> 　　Chichagov, one of the most zealous &quot;cutters-off&quot; 
                and &quot;breakers-up,&quot; who had first wanted to effect a 
                diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go 
                where he was sent: Chichagov, noted for the boldness with which 
                he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be under 
                an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with 
                Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutuzov, and found that peace 
                had already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the 
                merit of securing that peace was really Kutuzov's; this Chichagov 
                was the first to meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was 
                to stay. In undress naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his 
                cap under his arm, he handed Kutuzov a garrison report and the 
                keys of the town. The contemptuously respectful attitude of the 
                younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the 
                highest degree by the behavior of Chichagov, who knew of the accusations 
                that were being directed against Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned 
                that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from 
                him at Borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... 
                On the contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you 
                want to give dinner parties,&quot; warmly replied Chichagov, who 
                tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore 
                imagined Kutuzov to be animated by the same desire.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle 
                penetrating smile: &quot;I meant merely to say what I said.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater 
                part of the army at Vilna. Those about him said that he became 
                extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in 
                that town. He attended to army affairs reluctantly, left everything 
                to his generals, and while awaiting the Emperor's arrival led 
                a dissipated life.</p>
              <p> 　　Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his 
                suite- Count Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others- 
                the Emperor reached Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling 
                sleigh drove straight to the castle. In spite of the severe frost 
                some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform 
                stood in front of the castle, as well as a guard of honor of the 
                Semenov regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka 
                with three foam-flecked horses, shouted &quot;Coming!&quot; and 
                Konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was 
                waiting in the hall porter's little lodge.</p>
              <p> 　　A minute later the old man's large stout figure in full-dress 
                uniform, his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round 
                his stomach, waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with 
                its peaks to the sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and 
                walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of 
                the street, took in his hand the report he had prepared for the 
                Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka 
                furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching 
                sleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could 
                already be descried.</p>
              <p> 　　From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating 
                effect on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself 
                all over, readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew 
                himself up and, at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted 
                from the sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report 
                and began speaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head 
                to foot, frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself 
                went up to the old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And 
                this embrace too, owing to a long-standing impression related 
                to his innermost feelings, had its usual effect on Kutuzov and 
                he gave a sob.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and 
                again pressing the old man's hand went with him into the castle.</p>
              <p> 　　When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his 
                dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes 
                made at Krasnoe and the Berezina, and informed him of his intentions 
                for a future campaign abroad. Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark. 
                The same submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened 
                to the Emperor's commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years 
                before settled on his face now.</p>
              <p> 　　When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was 
                crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested 
                by someone's voice saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your Serene Highness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the 
                eyes of Count Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver 
                on which lay a small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand 
                what was expected of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile 
                flashed across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully 
                he took the object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of 
                St. George of the First Class.</p>

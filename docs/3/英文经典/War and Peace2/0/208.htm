              <p> 　　When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin's 
                broadsheets that had been brought that day.</p>
              <p> 　　The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchin had 
                forbidden people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he 
                was glad that ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving the city. 
                &quot;There will be less panic and less gossip,&quot; ran the 
                broadsheet &quot;but I will stake my life on it that that will 
                not enter Moscow.&quot; These words showed Pierre clearly for 
                the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The second 
                broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyazma, that Count 
                Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the 
                inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for 
                them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could 
                be had at a low price. The tone of the proclamation was not as 
                jocose as in the former Chigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these 
                broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired 
                with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary 
                horror in him was drawing near.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?&quot; 
                he asked himself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards 
                that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of 
                patience.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If this patience comes out,&quot; he said to himself 
                after shuffling the cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting 
                his head, &quot;if it comes out, it means... what does it mean?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice 
                of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come 
                in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then it will mean that I must go to the army,&quot; 
                said Pierre to himself. &quot;Come in, come in!&quot; he added 
                to the princess.</p>
              <p> 　　Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and 
                long waist, was still living in Pierre's house. The two younger 
                ones had both married.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse my coming to you, cousin,&quot; she said in a 
                reproachful and agitated voice. &quot;You know some decision must 
                be come to. What is going to happen? Everyone has left Moscow 
                and the people are rioting. How is it that we are staying on?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,&quot; 
                said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward 
                her, always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna 
                told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It 
                certainly does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous- 
                they no longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At 
                this rate they will soon begin beating us. One can't walk in the 
                streets. But, above all, the French will be here any day now, 
                so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,&quot; 
                she went on, &quot;arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever 
                I may be, I can't live under Bonaparte's rule.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information 
                from? On the contrary...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they 
                please.... If you don't want to do this...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I will, I'll give the order at once.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to 
                be angry with. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you have been misinformed,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Everything 
                is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! 
                I've just been reading...&quot; He showed her the broadsheet. 
                &quot;Count Rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it 
                that the enemy will not enter Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, that count of yours!&quot; said the princess malevolently. 
                &quot;He is a hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people 
                to riot. Didn't he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, 
                'whoever it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'? 
                (How silly!) 'And honor and glory to whoever captures him,' he 
                says. This is what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna 
                told me the mob near killed her because she said something in 
                French.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, but it's so... You take everything so to heart,&quot; 
                said Pierre, and began laying out his cards for patience.</p>
              <p> 　　Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the 
                army, but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of 
                agitation, irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully 
                expecting something terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre's 
                head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the 
                equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one 
                of the estates. In general the head steward made out to Pierre 
                that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre 
                listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, sell it,&quot; said he. &quot;What's to be 
                done? I can't draw back now!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the 
                better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the 
                catastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew 
                was left in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of 
                his intimate friends only the Rostovs remained, but he did not 
                go to see them.</p>
              <p> 　　To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village 
                of Vorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing 
                to destroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next 
                day. The balloon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it 
                was being constructed by the Emperor's desire. The Emperor had 
                written to Count Rostopchin as follows: </p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable 
                and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General 
                Kutuzov to let him know. I have informed him of the matter.</p>
              <p> 　　Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends 
                for the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into 
                the enemy's hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements 
                with those of the commander in chief. </p>
              <p> 　　On his way home from Vorontsovo, as he was passing the Bolotnoe 
                Place Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place, stopped 
                and got out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy 
                was being flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner 
                was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, 
                in blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. 
                Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their 
                faces they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering 
                look resembling that on the thin Frenchman's face, Pierre pushed 
                his way in through the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? Who is it? What is it for?&quot; he kept 
                asking.</p>
              <p> 　　But the attention of the crowd- officials, burghers, shopkeepers, 
                peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses- was so eagerly 
                centered on what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered 
                him. The stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and 
                evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without 
                looking about him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began 
                to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry 
                with himself for doing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, 
                to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's cook to some prince.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... 
                sets his teeth on edge!&quot; said a wrinkled clerk who was standing 
                behind Pierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would 
                be appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to 
                watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, 
                went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, 
                and took his seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed 
                several times so audibly that the coachman asked him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your pleasure?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going?&quot; shouted Pierre to the man, 
                who was driving to Lubyanka Street.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the Governor's, as you ordered,&quot; answered the 
                coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fool! Idiot!&quot; shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman- 
                a thing he rarely did. &quot;Home, I told you! And drive faster, 
                blockhead!&quot; &quot;I must get away this very day,&quot; he 
                murmured to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding 
                the Lobnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that 
                he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army 
                that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the 
                coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.</p>
              <p> 　　On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey- his head 
                coachman who knew everything, could do anything, and was known 
                to all Moscow- that he would leave that night for the army at 
                Mozhaysk, and that his saddle horses should be sent there. This 
                could not all be arranged that day, so on Evstafey's representation 
                Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time 
                for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.</p>
              <p> 　　On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell 
                of rain, and after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses 
                that night in Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great 
                battle that evening. (This was the battle of Shevardino.) He was 
                told that there in Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, 
                but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won. At dawn 
                next day Pierre was approaching Mozhaysk.</p>
              <p> 　　Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and 
                at the hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there 
                was no room to be had. It was full of officers.</p>
              <p> 　　Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed 
                or on the march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, 
                and cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he 
                could, and the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he 
                plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless 
                agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced 
                before. It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the Sloboda 
                Palace during the Emperor's visit- a sense of the necessity of 
                undertaking something and sacrificing something. He now experienced 
                a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men's happiness- 
                the comforts of life, wealth, even life itself- is rubbish it 
                is pleasant to throw away, compared with something... With what? 
                Pierre could not say, and he did not try to determine for whom 
                and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything. 
                He was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for; 
                the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous 
                sensation. </p>

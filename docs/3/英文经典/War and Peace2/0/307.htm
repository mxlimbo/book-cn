              <p> 　　Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Petya and Dolokhov 
                rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the 
                French camp, and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they 
                descended into the hollow. On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told 
                the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at 
                a quick trot along the road to the bridge. Petya, his heart in 
                his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I have a pistol,&quot; 
                whispered he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't talk Russian,&quot; said Dolokhov in a hurried 
                whisper, and at that very moment they heard through the darkness 
                the challenge: &quot;Qui vive?&quot;* and the click of a musket. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Who goes there?&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The blood rushed to Petya's face and he grasped his pistol.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lanciers du 6-me,&quot;* replied Dolokhov, neither hastening 
                nor slackening his horse's pace. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Lancers of the 6th Regiment.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mot d'ordre.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Password.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dites donc, le colonel Gerard est ici?&quot;* he asked. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mot d'ordre,&quot; repeated the sentinel, barring the 
                way and not replying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne 
                demandent pas le mot d'ordre...&quot; cried Dolokhov suddenly 
                flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel. &quot;Je vous 
                demande si le colonel est ici.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;When an officer is making his round, sentinels don't 
                ask him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is 
                here.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had 
                stepped aside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.</p>
              <p> 　　Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov 
                stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were. 
                The man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came 
                close up to Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained 
                simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers 
                were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, 
                as he called the landowner's house.</p>
              <p> 　　Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk 
                could be heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the 
                courtyard of the landowner's house. Having ridden in, he dismounted 
                and approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several 
                men talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron 
                at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue 
                overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring 
                its contents with a ramrod.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, he's a hard nut to crack,&quot; said one of the 
                officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the 
                fire.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He'll make them get a move on, those fellows!&quot; 
                said another, laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the 
                sound of Dolokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the 
                fire leading their horses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bonjour, messieurs!&quot;* said Dolokhov loudly and 
                clearly. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Good day, gentlemen.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the 
                fire, and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, 
                came up to Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that you, Clement?&quot; he asked. &quot;Where the 
                devil...? But, noticing his mistake, he broke off short and, with 
                a frown, greeted Dolokhov as a stranger, asking what he could 
                do for him.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake 
                their regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether 
                they knew anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, 
                and Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and 
                Dolokhov with hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were 
                silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come 
                too late,&quot; said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed 
                laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on 
                farther that night.</p>
              <p> 　　He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring 
                the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the 
                officer with the long neck. That officer did not take his eyes 
                from Dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged. Dolokhov, 
                as if he had not heard the question, did not reply, but lighting 
                a short French pipe which he took from his pocket began asking 
                the officer in how far the road before them was safe from Cossacks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those brigands are everywhere,&quot; replied an officer 
                from behind the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to 
                stragglers such as his companion and himself, &quot;but probably 
                they would not dare to attack large detachments?&quot; he added 
                inquiringly. No one replied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now he'll come away,&quot; Petya thought every 
                moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk.</p>
              <p> 　　But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped 
                and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were 
                in the battalion, how many battalions, and how many prisoners. 
                Asking about the Russian prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov 
                said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A horrid business dragging these corpses about with 
                one! It would be better to shoot such rabble,&quot; and burst 
                into loud laughter, so strange that Petya thought the French would 
                immediately detect their disguise, and involuntarily took a step 
                back from the campfire.</p>
              <p> 　　No one replied a word to Dolokhov's laughter, and a French 
                officer whom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) 
                rose and whispered something to a companion. Dolokhov got up and 
                called to the soldier who was holding their horses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will they bring our horses or not?&quot; thought Petya, 
                instinctively drawing nearer to Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　The horses were brought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good evening, gentlemen,&quot; said Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya wished to say &quot;Good night&quot; but could not utter 
                a word. The officers were whispering together. Dolokhov was a 
                long time mounting his horse which would not stand still, then 
                he rode out of the yard at a footpace. Petya rode beside him, 
                longing to look round to see whether or no the French were running 
                after them, but not daring to.</p>
              <p> 　　Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across 
                the open country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped 
                and listened. &quot;Do you hear?&quot; he asked. Petya recognized 
                the sound of Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian 
                prisoners round their campfires. When they had descended to the 
                bridge Petya and Dolokhov rode past the sentinel, who without 
                saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then they descended 
                into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well now, good-by. Tell Denisov, 'at the first shot 
                at daybreak,'&quot; said Dolokhov and was about to ride away, 
                but Petya seized hold of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really!&quot; he cried, &quot;you are such a hero! Oh, 
                how fine, how splendid! How I love you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right!&quot; said Dolokhov. But Petya 
                did not let go of him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that 
                Petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him. Dolokhov 
                kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and vanished into the darkness.

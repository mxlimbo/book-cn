          <tr>

              <p> 　　One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the 
                so-called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against 
                men pressed together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars 
                that take on a national character. In such actions, instead of 
                two crowds opposing each other, the men disperse, attack singly, 
                run away when attacked by stronger forces, but again attack when 
                opportunity offers. This was done by the guerrillas in Spain, 
                by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians in 
                1812.</p>
              <p> 　　People have called this kind of war &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; 
                and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning. 
                But such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly 
                opposed to a well-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible. 
                That rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces 
                in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict.</p>
              <p> 　　Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly 
                infringes that rule.</p>
              <p> 　　This contradiction arises from the fact that military science 
                assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. 
                Military science says that the more troops the greater the strength. 
                Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison.* </p>
              <p> 　　*Large battalions are always victorious. </p>
              <p> 　　For military science to say this is like defining momentum 
                in mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta 
                are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved 
                are equal or unequal.</p>
              <p> 　　Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.</p>
              <p> 　　In military affairs the strength of an army is the product 
                of its mass and some unknown x.</p>
              <p> 　　Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances 
                of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its 
                strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely 
                admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover 
                it- now in a geometric formation, now in the equipment employed, 
                now, and most usually, in the genius of the commanders. But the 
                assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield 
                results which accord with the historic facts.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted 
                to gratify the &quot;heroes&quot;) of the efficacy of the directions 
                issued in wartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown 
                quantity.</p>
              <p> 　　That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to 
                say, the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger 
                felt by all the men composing an army, quite independently of 
                whether they are, or are not, fighting under the command of a 
                genius, in two- or three-line formation, with cudgels or with 
                rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men who want to fight 
                will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions 
                for fighting.</p>
              <p> 　　The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the 
                mass gives the resulting force. To define and express the significance 
                of this unknown factor- the spirit of an army- is a problem for 
                science.</p>
              <p> 　　This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute 
                for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force 
                becomes apparent- such as the commands of the general, the equipment 
                employed, and so on- mistaking these for the real significance 
                of the factor, and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its 
                entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to 
                face danger. Only then, expressing known historic facts by equations 
                and comparing the relative significance of this factor, can we 
                hope to define the unknown.</p>
              <p> 　　Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, 
                or divisions, conquer- that is, kill or take captive- all the 
                others, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side 
                four and on the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four 
                were equal to the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently 
                x/y = 15/4. This equation does not give us the value of the unknown 
                factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing 
                variously selected historic units (battles, campaigns, periods 
                of war) into such equations, a series of numbers could be obtained 
                in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered.</p>
              <p> 　　The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, 
                and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth 
                that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men 
                forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement 
                in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But this 
                rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually 
                proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the 
                facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops 
                occurs, as in all national wars.</p>
              <p> 　　The French, retreating in 1812- though according to tactics 
                they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves- 
                congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so 
                fallen that only the mass held the army together. The Russians, 
                on the contrary, ought according to tactics to have attacked in 
                mass, but in fact they split up into small units, because their 
                spirit had so risen that separate individuals, without orders, 
                dealt blows at the French without needing any compulsion to induce 
                them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's regiment was among the reserves which till 
                after one o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk, under 
                heavy artillery fire. Toward two o'clock the regiment, having 
                already lost more than two hundred men, was moved forward into 
                a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll 
                Battery, where thousands of men perished that day and on which 
                an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns 
                was directed between one and two o'clock.</p>
              <p> 　　Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the 
                regiment here lost another third of its men. From in front and 
                especially from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, 
                and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole 
                space in front, quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling 
                shells flew unceasingly. At times, as if to allow them a respite, 
                a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and 
                shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men were torn 
                from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being 
                dragged away and the wounded carried off.</p>
              <p> 　　With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained 
                for those not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, 
                three hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always 
                in one and the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. 
                Talk was rarely heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every 
                time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of &quot;stretchers!&quot; 
                was heard. Most of the time, by their officers' order, the men 
                sat on the ground. One, having taken off his shako, carefully 
                loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again; 
                another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished his 
                bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his 
                bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and 
                put his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts 
                in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the 
                cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men 
                were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers went past, when 
                some troops retreated, and when great masses of the enemy came 
                into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these 
                things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of 
                our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were 
                heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted 
                by occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. 
                It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief 
                in everyday, commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was 
                passing in front of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart 
                put its leg over a trace. &quot;Hey, look at the trace horse!... 
                Get her leg out! She'll fall.... Ah, they don't see it!&quot; 
                came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment. Another 
                time, general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming 
                heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in 
                front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell 
                fell close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, 
                and darted aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the 
                whole regiment. But such distractions lasted only a moment, and 
                for eight hours the men had been inactive, without food, in constant 
                fear of death, and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler 
                and gloomier.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, 
                paced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at 
                the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and 
                arms behind his back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders 
                to be given. Everything went on of itself. The killed were dragged 
                from the front, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed 
                up. If any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately 
                and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to 
                rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example, walked 
                about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced that this 
                was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them. 
                All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were unconsciously 
                bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation. 
                He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, 
                and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big 
                strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by 
                the mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he 
                must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped 
                the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, 
                rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter 
                scent. Nothing remained of the previous day's thoughts. He thought 
                of nothing. He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring 
                sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from 
                the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely familiar 
                faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. &quot;Here 
                it comes... this one is coming our way again!&quot; he thought, 
                listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. 
                &quot;One, another! Again! It has hit....&quot; He stopped and 
                looked at the ranks. &quot;No, it has gone over. But this one 
                has hit!&quot; And again he started trying to reach the boundary 
                strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces from him, 
                a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill ran 
                down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had 
                been hit- a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Adjutant!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Order them not to 
                crowd together.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince 
                Andrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look out!&quot; came a frightened cry from a soldier 
                and, like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the 
                ground, a shell dropped with little noise within two steps of 
                Prince Andrew and close to the battalion commander's horse. The 
                horse first, regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show 
                fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and galloped 
                aside. The horse's terror infected the men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lie down!&quot; cried the adjutant, throwing himself 
                flat on the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top 
                between him and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant 
                between the field and the meadow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can this be death?&quot; thought Prince Andrew, looking 
                with a quite new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and 
                the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black 
                ball. &quot;I cannot, I do not wish to die. I love life- I love 
                this grass, this earth, this air....&quot; He thought this, and 
                at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's shameful, sir!&quot; he said to the adjutant. &quot;What...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came 
                the sound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking 
                window frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew 
                started to one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several 
                officers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood 
                was welling out making a large stain on the grass.</p>
              <p> 　　The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind 
                the officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in 
                the grass, breathing heavily and noisily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you waiting for? Come along!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, 
                but he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pick him up, lift him, it's all the same!&quot; cried 
                someone.</p>
              <p> 　　They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means 
                death! My God!&quot;- voices among the officers were heard saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It flew a hair's breadth past my ear,&quot; said the 
                adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, 
                started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the 
                dressing station.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!&quot; shouted an 
                officer, seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants, 
                who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!&quot; said the 
                foremost peasant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now that's right!&quot; said the one behind joyfully, 
                when he had got into step.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency! Eh, Prince!&quot; said the trembling 
                voice of Timokhin, who had run up and was looking down on the 
                stretcher.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker 
                from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again 
                his eyelids drooped. </p>
              <p> 　　The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to dressing station by 
                the wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted 
                of three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of 
                a birch wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The 
                horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows 
                flew down and pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting 
                blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the 
                tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men in various 
                garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier 
                stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers 
                keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding 
                the officers' orders, the soldiers stood leaning against their 
                stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend the 
                difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the 
                tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally 
                dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were 
                to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside 
                the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for 
                vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew's bearers, stepping 
                over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a 
                regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, 
                awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a 
                long time could not make out what was going on around him. He 
                remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black 
                ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps 
                from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting 
                general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired noncommissioned 
                officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the head 
                and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, 
                a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, 
                we grabbed the King himself!&quot; cried he, looking around him 
                with eyes that glittered with fever. &quot;If only reserves had 
                come up just then, lads, there wouldn't have been nothing left 
                of him! I tell you surely...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked 
                at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. &quot;But 
                isn't it all the same now?&quot; thought he. &quot;And what will 
                be there, and what has there been here? Why was I so reluctant 
                to part with life? There was something in this life I did not 
                and do not understand.&quot;</p>

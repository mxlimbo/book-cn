              <p> 　　Napoleon's generals- Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near 
                that region of fire and sometimes even entered it- repeatedly 
                led into it huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to 
                what had always happened in their former battles, instead of the 
                news they expected of the enemy's flight, these orderly masses 
                returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs. The generals 
                re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased. In the 
                middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand 
                reinforcements.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when 
                Murat's adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians 
                would be routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Reinforcements?&quot; said Napoleon in a tone of stern 
                surprise, looking at the adjutant- a handsome lad with long black 
                curls arranged like Murat's own- as though he did not understand 
                his words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Reinforcements!&quot; thought Napoleon to himself. &quot;How 
                can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army 
                directed against a weak, unentrenched Russian wing?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell the King of Naples,&quot; said he sternly, &quot;that 
                it is not noon yet, and I don't yet see my chessboard clearly. 
                Go!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply 
                without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where 
                men were being slaughtered.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier 
                began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to 
                interest Napoleon, Berthier's eyes turned to look at a general 
                with a suite, who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering 
                horse. It was Belliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor 
                with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating 
                the necessity of sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor 
                that the Russians were lost if the Emperor would give another 
                division.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and 
                down without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly 
                to the generals of the suite around him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are very fiery, Belliard,&quot; said Napoleon, when 
                he again came up to the general. &quot;In the heat of a battle 
                it is easy to make a mistake. Go and have another look and then 
                come back to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another 
                part of the battlefield galloped up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, what do you want?&quot; asked Napoleon in 
                the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, the prince...&quot; began the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Asks for reinforcements?&quot; said Napoleon with an 
                angry gesture.</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, 
                but the Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, 
                came back, and called Berthier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We must give reserves,&quot; he said, moving his arms 
                slightly apart. &quot;Who do you think should be sent there?&quot; 
                he asked of Berthier (whom he subsequently termed &quot;that gosling 
                I have made an eagle&quot;).</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Send Claparede's division, sire,&quot; replied Berthier, 
                who knew all the divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon nodded assent.</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant galloped to Claparede's division and a few minutes 
                later the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. 
                Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No!&quot; he suddenly said to Berthier. &quot;I can't 
                send Claparede. Send Friant's division.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though there was no advantage in sending Friant's division 
                instead of Claparede's, and even in obvious inconvenience and 
                delay in stopping Claparede and sending Friant now, the order 
                was carried out exactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard 
                to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by 
                his medicines- a role he so justly understood and condemned.</p>
              <p> 　　Friant's division disappeared as the others had done into 
                the smoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued 
                to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same 
                thing. They all asked for reinforcements and all said that the 
                Russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish 
                fire under which the French army was melting away.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.</p>
              <p> 　　M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since 
                morning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest 
                lunch to His Majesty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the 
                negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. 
                de Beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that 
                there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go away...&quot; exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, 
                and turned aside.</p>
              <p> 　　A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed 
                on M. de Beausset's face and he glided away to the other generals.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that 
                of an ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money 
                about and always winning, suddenly just when he has calculated 
                all the chances of the game, finds that the more he considers 
                his play the more surely he loses.</p>
              <p> 　　His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same 
                preparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same 
                proclamation courte et energique, he himself was still the same: 
                he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and 
                skillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz 
                and Friedland- yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally 
                become impotent.</p>
              <p> 　　All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with 
                success: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack 
                by reserves to break the enemy's line, and a cavalry attack by 
                &quot;the men of iron,&quot; all these methods had already been 
                employed, yet not only was there no victory, but from all sides 
                came the same news of generals killed and wounded, of reinforcements 
                needed, of the impossibility of driving back the Russians, and 
                of disorganization among his own troops.</p>
              <p> 　　Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered 
                a few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with 
                congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, 
                the corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, 
                cannon and stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the 
                cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, 
                Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now 
                something strange was happening to his troops.</p>
              <p> 　　Despite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that 
                this was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened 
                in his former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt 
                by all the men about him experienced in the art of war. All their 
                faces looked dejected, and they all shunned one another's eyes- 
                only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was 
                happening.</p>
              <p> 　　But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the 
                meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight 
                hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was 
                a lost battle and that the least accident might now- with the 
                fight balanced on such a strained center- destroy him and his 
                army.</p>
              <p> 　　When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian 
                campaign in which not one battle had been won, and in which not 
                a flag, or cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, 
                when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around 
                him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground- 
                a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him, and 
                all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his 
                mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing, might break through 
                his center, he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball. 
                All this was possible. In former battles he had only considered 
                the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky chances 
                presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like 
                a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack 
                him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow 
                which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels that his 
                arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable 
                destruction seizes him in his helplessness.</p>
              <p> 　　The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of 
                the French army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently 
                on a campstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on 
                his knees. Berthier approached and suggested that they should 
                ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What do you say?&quot; asked Napoleon. &quot;Yes, 
                tell them to bring me my horse.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.</p>
              <p> 　　Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space 
                through which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools 
                of blood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his 
                generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in 
                such a small area. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten 
                hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the 
                spectacle, as music does to tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up 
                the high ground at Semenovsk, and through the smoke saw ranks 
                of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village 
                and its knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line 
                and sent forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it 
                was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to 
                the French or the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again 
                fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He 
                could not stop what was going on before him and around him and 
                was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him, and from 
                its lack of success this affair, for the first time, seemed to 
                him unnecessary and horrible.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer 
                to lead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing 
                near Napoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this 
                general's senseless offer.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have 
                my Guard destroyed!&quot; he said, and turning his horse rode 
                back to Shevardino.</p>

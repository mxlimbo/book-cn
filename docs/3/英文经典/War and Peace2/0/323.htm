              <p> 　　The fifth of November was the first day of what is called 
                the battle of Krasnoe. Toward evening- after much disputing and 
                many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper 
                places, and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders- 
                when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight 
                and that there could and would be no battle, Kutuzov left Krasnoe 
                and went to Dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been 
                transferred.</p>
              <p> 　　The day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his 
                plump little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented 
                generals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along 
                the road groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were 
                seven thousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. 
                Near Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with 
                talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to 
                get hold of, were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed 
                French guns. At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz 
                of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who, wearing 
                a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged 
                on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white 
                horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns 
                and prisoners had been captured.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the 
                general was saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied 
                look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who 
                presented a specially wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured 
                by frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen 
                and festering eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of 
                them, one of whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing 
                a piece of raw flesh with their hands. There was something horrible 
                and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and 
                in the malevolent expression with which, after a glance at Kutuzov, 
                the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on 
                with what he was doing.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He 
                puckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his 
                head. At another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly 
                patting a Frenchman on the shoulder, saying something to him in 
                a friendly manner, and Kutuzov with the same expression on his 
                face again swayed his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What were you saying?&quot; he asked the general, who 
                continuing his report directed the commander in chief's attention 
                to some standards captured from the French and standing in front 
                of the Preobrazhensk regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, the standards!&quot; said Kutuzov, evidently detaching 
                himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking 
                at him from all sides awaiting a word from him.</p>
              <p> 　　He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed 
                deeply, and closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the 
                soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander 
                in chief with them. Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then, 
                submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his 
                position, raised his head and began to speak. A throng of officers 
                surrounded him. He looked attentively around at the circle of 
                officers, recognizing several of them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I thank you all!&quot; he said, addressing the soldiers 
                and then again the officers. In the stillness around him his slowly 
                uttered words were distinctly heard. &quot;I thank you all for 
                your hard and faithful service. The victory is complete and Russia 
                will not forget you! Honor to you forever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused and looked around.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lower its head, lower it!&quot; he said to a soldier 
                who had accidentally lowered the French eagle he was holding before 
                the Preobrazhensk standards. &quot;Lower, lower, that's it. Hurrah 
                lads!&quot; he added, addressing the men with a rapid movement 
                of his chin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hur-r-rah!&quot; roared thousands of voices.</p>
              <p> 　　While the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov leaned forward in 
                his saddle and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild 
                and apparently ironic gleam.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, brothers...&quot; said he when the shouts had 
                ceased... and all at once his voice and the expression of his 
                face changed. It was no longer the commander in chief speaking 
                but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something 
                very important.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks 
                of the soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he 
                was going to say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, but it 
                can't be helped! Bear up; it won't be for long now! We'll see 
                our visitors off and then we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your 
                service. It is hard for you, but still you are at home while they- 
                you see what they have come to,&quot; said he, pointing to the 
                prisoners. &quot;Worse off than our poorest beggars. While they 
                were strong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we may even pity 
                them. They are human beings too. Isn't it so, lads?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering 
                gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His 
                face grew brighter and brighter with an old man's mild smile, 
                which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of 
                wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, 
                the bloody bastards!&quot; he cried, suddenly lifting his head.</p>
              <p> 　　And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first 
                time during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the 
                soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov's words were hardly understood by the troops. No one 
                could have repeated the field marshal's address, begun solemnly 
                and then changing into an old man's simplehearted talk; but the 
                hearty sincerity of that speech, the feeling of majestic triumph 
                combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice 
                of our cause, exactly expressed by that old man's good-natured 
                expletives, was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every 
                soldier and found expression in their joyous and long-sustained 
                shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed Kutuzov 
                asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in 
                answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.

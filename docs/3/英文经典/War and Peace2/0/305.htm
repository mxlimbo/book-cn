              <p> 　　Petya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, 
                joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general 
                commanding a large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received 
                his commission, and especially since he had joined the active 
                army and taken part in the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in 
                a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up and 
                in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something 
                really heroic. He was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced 
                in the army, but at the same time it always seemed to him that 
                the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he 
                did not happen to be. And he was always in a hurry to get where 
                he was not.</p>
              <p> 　　When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed 
                a wish to send somebody to Denisov's detachment, Petya begged 
                so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse. But 
                when dispatching him he recalled Petya's mad action at the battle 
                of Vyazma, where instead of riding by the road to the place to 
                which he had been sent, he had galloped to the advanced line under 
                the fire of the French and had there twice fired his pistol. So 
                now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action 
                whatever of Denisov's. That was why Petya had blushed and grown 
                confused when Denisov asked him whether he could stay. Before 
                they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered 
                he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once. 
                But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and learned that there 
                would certainly be an attack that night, he decided, with the 
                rapidity with which young people change their views, that the 
                general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a rubbishy 
                German, that Denisov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and Tikhon 
                a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them 
                at a moment of difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul 
                rode up to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could 
                be seen, and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters 
                in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the 
                forest where the French could not see the smoke. In the passage 
                of the small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping 
                some mutton. In the room three officers of Denisov's band were 
                converting a door into a tabletop. Petya took off his wet clothes, 
                gave them to be dried, and at once began helping the officers 
                to fix up the dinner table.</p>
              <p> 　　In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on 
                it. On the table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast 
                mutton, and salt.</p>
              <p> 　　Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory 
                mutton with his hands, down which the grease trickled, Petya was 
                in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men, and consequently 
                of confidence that others loved him in the same way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?&quot; said 
                he to Denisov. &quot;It's all right my staying a day with you?&quot; 
                And not waiting for a reply he answered his own question: &quot;You 
                see I was told to find out- well, I am finding out.... Only do 
                let me into the very... into the chief... I don't want a reward... 
                But I want...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Petya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back 
                his head and flourishing his arms.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Into the vewy chief...&quot; Denisov repeated with a 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only, please let me command something, so that I may 
                really command...&quot; Petya went on. &quot;What would it be 
                to you?... Oh, you want a knife?&quot; he said, turning to an 
                officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.</p>
              <p> 　　And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please keep it. I have several like it,&quot; said Petya, 
                blushing. &quot;Heavens! I was quite forgetting!&quot; he suddenly 
                cried. &quot;I have some raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless 
                ones. We have a new sutler and he has such capital things. I bought 
                ten pounds. I am used to something sweet. Would you like some?...&quot; 
                and Petya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought 
                back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins. &quot;Have 
                some, gentlemen, have some!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You want a coffeepot, don't you?&quot; he asked the 
                esaul. &quot;I bought a capital one from our sutler! He has splendid 
                things. And he's very honest, that's the chief thing. I'll be 
                sure to send it to you. Or perhaps your flints are giving out, 
                or are worn out- that happens sometimes, you know. I have brought 
                some with me, here they are&quot;- and he showed a bag- &quot;a 
                hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as many 
                as you want, or all if you like....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped 
                and blushed.</p>
              <p> 　　He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else 
                that was foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered 
                the French drummer boy. &quot;It's capital for us here, but what 
                of him? Where have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven't they 
                hurt his feelings?&quot; he thought. But having caught himself 
                saying too much about the flints, he was now afraid to speak out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I might ask,&quot; he thought, &quot;but they'll say: 
                'He's a boy himself and so he pities the boy.' I'll show them 
                tomorrow whether I'm a boy. Will it seem odd if I ask?&quot; Petya 
                thought. &quot;Well, never mind!&quot; and immediately, blushing 
                and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared 
                ironical, he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give 
                him something to eat?... Perhaps...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, he's a poor little fellow,&quot; said Denisov, 
                who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder. &quot;Call 
                him in. His name is Vincent Bosse. Have him fetched.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll call him,&quot; said Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,&quot; Denisov 
                repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. He 
                slipped in between the officers, came close to Denisov, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how 
                splendid!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bosse! Vincent!&quot; Petya cried, stopping outside 
                the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who do you want, sir?&quot; asked a voice in the darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured 
                that day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Vesenny?&quot; said a Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　Vincent, the boy's name, had already been changed by the Cossacks 
                into Vesenny (vernal) and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers. 
                In both these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched 
                the impression made by the young lad.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesenya! 
                Vesenya!- Vesenny!&quot; laughing voices were heard calling to 
                one another in the darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's a smart lad,&quot; said an hussar standing near 
                Petya. &quot;We gave him something to eat a while ago. He was 
                awfully hungry!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard 
                in the darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, c'est vous!&quot; said Petya. &quot;Voulez-vous 
                manger? N'ayez pas peur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,&quot;* he 
                added shyly and affectionately, touching the boy's hand. &quot;Entrez, 
                entrez.&quot;*[2] </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? Don't be 
                afraid, they won't hurt you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;Come in, come in.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Merci, monsieur,&quot;* said the drummer boy in a trembling 
                almost childish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on 
                the threshold. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer 
                boy, but did not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in 
                the passage. Then in the darkness he took the boy's hand and pressed 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come in, come in!&quot; he repeated in a gentle whisper. 
                &quot;Oh, what can I do for him?&quot; he thought, and opening 
                the door he let the boy pass in first.</p>
              <p> 　　When the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance 
                from him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention 
                to him. But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether 
                it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy. </p>

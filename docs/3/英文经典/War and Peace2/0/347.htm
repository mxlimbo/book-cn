              <p> 　　Natasha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 
                already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed 
                and whom she was now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, 
                so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust, motherly 
                woman the slim, lively Natasha of former days. Her features were 
                more defined and had a calm, soft, and serene expression. In her 
                face there was none of the ever-glowing animation that had formerly 
                burned there and constituted its charm. Now her face and body 
                were of all that one saw, and her soul was not visible at all. 
                All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and fertile woman. 
                The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That happened 
                only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home, 
                or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary 
                spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, 
                who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew's memory), or on 
                the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing, 
                a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage. At the 
                rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully 
                developed body she was even more attractive than in former days.</p>
              <p> 　　Since their marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in 
                Moscow, in Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her 
                mother, that is to say, in Nicholas' house. The young Countess 
                Bezukhova was not often seen in society, and those who met her 
                there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive 
                nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked solitude- she did not know 
                whether she liked it or not, she even thought that she did not- 
                but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing of her 
                children, and sharing every moment of her husband's life, she 
                had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing 
                society. All who had known Natasha before her marriage wondered 
                at the change in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old 
                countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all Natasha's 
                outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband- 
                as she herself had once exclaimed at Otradnoe not so much in fun 
                as in earnest- and her mother was now surprised at the surprise 
                expressed by those who had never understood Natasha, and she kept 
                saying that she had always known that Natasha would make an exemplary 
                wife and mother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow 
                all bounds,&quot; said the countess, &quot;so that it even becomes 
                absurd.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever 
                folk, especially by the French, which says that a girl should 
                not let herself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, 
                should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was 
                unmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did 
                before he became her husband. Natasha on the contrary had at once 
                abandoned all her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually 
                powerful part. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully 
                seductive. She took no pains with her manners or with of speech, 
                or with her toilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most 
                becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too 
                exacting. She acted in contradiction to all those rules. She felt 
                that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would 
                now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she 
                had from the first moment given herself up entirely- that is, 
                with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden from him. 
                She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by 
                the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something 
                else- indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and 
                soul.</p>
              <p> 　　To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing 
                romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange 
                as to adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others 
                might perhaps have been agreeable- she did not know- but she had 
                no time at all for it. The chief reason for devoting no time either 
                to singing, to dress, or to choosing her words was that she really 
                had no time to spare for these things.</p>
              <p> 　　We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed 
                in a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject 
                so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's 
                entire attention is devoted to it.</p>
              <p> 　　The subject which wholly engrossed Natasha's attention was 
                her family: that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that 
                he should belong entirely to her and to the home, and the children 
                whom she had to bear, bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.</p>
              <p> 　　And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but 
                with her whole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed 
                her, the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more 
                inadequate did her powers appear, so that she concentrated them 
                wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all 
                that she considered necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　There were then as now conversations and discussions about 
                women's rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom 
                and rights, though these themes were not yet termed questions 
                as they are now; but these topics were not merely uninteresting 
                to Natasha, she positively did not understand them.</p>
              <p> 　　These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see 
                nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one 
                another, that is, only the beginnings of marriage and not its 
                whole significance, which lies in the family.</p>
              <p> 　　Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the 
                question of how to get the greatest gratification from one's dinner, 
                did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose 
                of a dinner is the nourishment it affords; and the purpose of 
                marriage is the family.</p>
              <p> 　　If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who 
                eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will 
                not attain his purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two 
                dinners.</p>
              <p> 　　If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes 
                to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, 
                but in that case will not have a family.</p>
              <p> 　　If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage 
                is the family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating 
                more than one can digest, and not having more wives or husbands 
                than are needed for the family- that is, one wife or one husband. 
                Natasha needed a husband. A husband was given her and he gave 
                her a family. And she not only saw no need of any other or better 
                husband, but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving 
                that husband and family, she could not imagine and saw no interest 
                in imagining how it would be if things were different.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not care for society in general, but prized the 
                more the society of her relatives- Countess Mary, and her brother, 
                her mother, and Sonya. She valued the company of those to whom 
                she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing 
                gown, and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain 
                on baby's napkin, and from whom she could hear reassuring words 
                to the effect that baby was much better.</p>
              <p> 　　To such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way 
                she dressed and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy- 
                she was jealous of Sonya, of the governess, and of every woman, 
                pretty or plain- were habitual subjects of jest to those about 
                her. The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife's 
                thumb, which was really true. From the very first days of their 
                married life Natasha had announced her demands. Pierre was greatly 
                surprised by his wife's view, to him a perfectly novel one, that 
                every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His 
                wife's demands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and 
                he submitted to them.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only 
                dared not flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any 
                other woman; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not 
                dare spend money a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any 
                length of time, except on business- in which his wife included 
                his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in the least understand 
                but to which she attributed great importance. To make up for this, 
                at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of 
                the whole family exactly as he chose. At home Natasha placed herself 
                in the position of a slave to her husband, and the whole household 
                went on tiptoe when he was occupied- that is, was reading or writing 
                in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for anything 
                to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express 
                a wish and Natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it.</p>
              <p> 　　The entire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed 
                orders, that is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their 
                way of life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, 
                Natasha's occupations, the children's upbringing, were all selected 
                not merely with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what 
                Natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed 
                his wishes to be. And she deduced the essentials of his wishes 
                quite correctly, and having once arrived at them clung to them 
                tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she 
                would fight him with his own weapons.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the 
                birth of their first child who was delicate, when they had to 
                change the wet nurse three times and Natasha fell ill from despair, 
                Pierre one day told her of Rousseau's view, with which he quite 
                agreed, that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When 
                her next baby was born, despite the opposition of her mother, 
                the doctors, and even of her husband himself- who were all vigorously 
                opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing then unheard 
                of and considered injurious- she insisted on having her own way, 
                and after that nursed all her babies herself.</p>
              <p> 　　It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband 
                and wife would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his 
                surprise and delight would find in his wife's ideas and actions 
                the very thought against which she had argued, but divested of 
                everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he 
                had added when expressing his opinion.</p>
              <p> 　　After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm 
                consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because 
                he saw himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad 
                within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only 
                what was really good in him was reflected in his wife, all that 
                was not quite good was rejected. And this was not the result of 
                logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection.

              <p> 　　When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the 
                latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not 
                French and wished to go away, but the officer would not hear of 
                it. He was so very polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely 
                grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre had not the 
                heart to refuse, and sat down with him in the parlor- the first 
                room they entered. To Pierre's assurances that he was not a Frenchman, 
                the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone could decline 
                so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said 
                that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let 
                it be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre 
                by gratitude for saving his life.</p>
              <p> 　　Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for 
                perceiving the feelings of others, and had he at all understood 
                what Pierre's feelings were, the latter would probably have left 
                him, but the man's animated obtuseness to everything other than 
                himself disarmed Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,&quot; said 
                the officer, looking at Pierre's fine though dirty linen and at 
                the ring on his finger. &quot;I owe my life to you and offer you 
                my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either an insult or a 
                service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French 
                sense of the word) in the officer's voice, in the expression of 
                his face and in his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling 
                in response to the Frenchman's smile, pressed the hand held out 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier 
                of the Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,&quot; 
                he introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering 
                his lips under his mustache. &quot;Will you now be so good as 
                to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, 
                instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in 
                my body?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, 
                began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason 
                for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, please!&quot; said he. &quot;I understand your reasons. 
                You are an officer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne 
                arms against us. That's not my business. I owe you my life. That 
                is enough for me. I am quite at your service. You belong to the 
                gentry?&quot; he concluded with a shade of inquiry in his tone. 
                Pierre bent his head. &quot;Your baptismal name, if you please. 
                That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That's all I want 
                to know.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar 
                and vodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from 
                a Russian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre 
                to share his dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly 
                like a healthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with 
                his strong teeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating- 
                &quot;Excellent! Delicious!&quot; His face grew red and was covered 
                with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with 
                pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan 
                and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle 
                of kvass, taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage 
                was already known to the French and had been given a special name. 
                They called it limonade de cochon (pig's lemonade), and Morel 
                spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen. 
                But as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through 
                Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to the 
                bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a 
                table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre. The 
                satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still 
                more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive 
                candle for saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets 
                enough in my body already. Here is one I got at Wagram&quot; (he 
                touched his side) &quot;and a second at Smolensk&quot;- he showed 
                a scar on his cheek- &quot;and this leg which as you see does 
                not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great battle 
                of la Moskowa. Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire 
                was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! 
                You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough 
                I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity those 
                who did not see it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was there,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave 
                foes. The great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!&quot; continued 
                the Frenchman. &quot;And you made us pay dear for it. I was at 
                it three times- sure as I sit here. Three times we reached the 
                guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures. 
                Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, 
                by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six times in succession 
                and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of Naples, who 
                knows what's what, cried 'Bravo!' Ha, ha! So you are one of us 
                soldiers!&quot; he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. &quot;So 
                much the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible 
                in battle... gallant... with the fair&quot; (he winked and smiled), 
                &quot;that's what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren't they?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay, so real, 
                and so pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as 
                he looked merrily at him. Probably the word &quot;gallant&quot; 
                turned the captain's thoughts to the state of Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have 
                all left Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid 
                of?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians 
                entered it?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ha, ha, ha!&quot; The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine 
                chuckle, patting Pierre on the shoulder. &quot;What a thing to 
                say!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Paris?... But Paris, Paris...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Paris- the capital of the world,&quot; Pierre finished 
                his remark for him.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short 
                in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, 
                kindly eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, if you hadn't told me you were Russian, I should 
                have wagered that you were Parisian! You have that... I don't 
                know what, that...&quot; and having uttered this compliment, he 
                again gazed at him in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have been in Paris. I spent years there,&quot; said 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn't 
                know Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. 
                Paris is Talma, la Duchenois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,&quot; 
                and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone 
                before, he added quickly: &quot;There is only one Paris in the 
                world. You have been to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, 
                I don't esteem you the less for it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the 
                days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily 
                enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To return to your ladies- I hear they are lovely. What 
                a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when 
                the French army is in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! 
                Your peasants, now- that's another thing; but you civilized people, 
                you ought to know us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, 
                Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the world's capitals.... We 
                are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to know. And then the 
                Emperor...&quot; he began, but Pierre interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor,&quot; Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly 
                became sad and embarrassed, &quot;is the Emperor...?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, 
                genius- that's what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell 
                you so.... I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father 
                was an emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has 
                taken hold of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur 
                and glory with which he has covered France. When I understood 
                what he wanted- when I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels 
                for us, you know, I said to myself: 'That is a monarch,' and I 
                devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest 
                man of the ages past or future.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he in Moscow?&quot; Pierre stammered with a guilty 
                look.</p>
              <p> 　　The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he will make his entry tomorrow,&quot; he replied, 
                and continued his talk.</p>
              <p> 　　Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several 
                voices at the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Wurttemberg 
                hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard 
                where the captain's horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly 
                because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in 
                French.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a 
                stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his 
                commanding officer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim 
                quarters that were already occupied. The German who knew little 
                French, answered the two first questions by giving the names of 
                his regiment and of his commanding officer, but in reply to the 
                third question which he did not understand said, introducing broken 
                French into his own German, that he was the quartermaster of the 
                regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses 
                one after another. Pierre, who knew German, translated what the 
                German said to the captain and gave the captain's reply to the 
                Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what was 
                said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. 
                The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a 
                loud voice.</p>
              <p> 　　When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same 
                place as before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed 
                suffering. He really was suffering at that moment. When the captain 
                went out and he was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and 
                realized the position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been 
                taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were 
                patronizing him. Painful as that was it was not that which tormented 
                Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of 
                his own weakness. The few glasses of wine he had drunk and the 
                conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood 
                of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days 
                and which was essential for the execution of his design. The pistol, 
                dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the 
                town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful 
                and worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he 
                would not do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding 
                that he would not carry out his intention. He struggled against 
                the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not 
                overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning 
                vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like 
                dust by contact with the first man he met.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling 
                a tune.</p>
              <p> 　　The Frenchman's chatter which had previously amused Pierre 
                now repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the 
                gesture with which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. 
                &quot;I will go away immediately. I won't say another word to 
                him,&quot; thought Pierre. He thought this, but still sat in the 
                same place. A strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; 
                he wished to get up and go away, but could not do so.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced 
                up and down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched 
                as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful,&quot; 
                he suddenly said. &quot;He's a German, but a nice fellow all the 
                same.... But he's a German.&quot; He sat down facing Pierre. &quot;By 
                the way, you know German, then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at him in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the German for 'shelter'?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shelter?&quot; Pierre repeated. &quot;The German for 
                shelter is Unterkunft.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How do you say it?&quot; the captain asked quickly and 
                doubtfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Unterkunft,&quot; Pierre repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Onterkoff,&quot; said the captain and looked at Pierre 
                for some seconds with laughing eyes. &quot;These Germans are first-rate 
                fools, don't you think so, Monsieur Pierre?&quot; he concluded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, let's have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, 
                shall we? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!&quot; 
                he called out gaily.</p>
              <p> 　　Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked 
                at Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled 
                expression on his companion's face. Ramballe, with genuine distress 
                and sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, we're sad,&quot; said he, touching Pierre's 
                hand. &quot;Have I upset you? No, really, have you anything against 
                me?&quot; he asked Pierre. &quot;Perhaps it's the state of affairs?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman's 
                eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel 
                friendship for you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. 
                It is for life and death. I say it with my hand on my heart!&quot; 
                said he, striking his chest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned 
                that &quot;shelter&quot; was Unterkunft in German, and his face 
                suddenly brightened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!&quot; 
                he cried gaily, filling two glasses with wine.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied 
                his too, again pressed Pierre's hand, and leaned his elbows on 
                the table in a pensive attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, my dear friend,&quot; he began, &quot;such is fortune's 
                caprice. Who would have said that I should be a soldier and a 
                captain of dragoons in the service of Bonaparte, as we used to 
                call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon 
                cher,&quot; he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man 
                who intends to tell a long story, &quot;that our name is one of 
                the most ancient in France.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And with a Frenchman's easy and naive frankness the captain 
                told Pierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, 
                and manhood, and all about his relations and his financial and 
                family affairs, &quot;ma pauvre mere&quot; playing of course an 
                important part in the story.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But all that is only life's setting, the real thing 
                is love- love! Am I not right, Monsieur Pierre?&quot; said he, 
                growing animated. &quot;Another glass?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, women, women!&quot; and the captain, looking with 
                glistening eyes at Pierre, began talking of love and of his love 
                affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, 
                looking at the officer's handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting 
                the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all 
                Ramballe's love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen 
                regard as the special charm and poetry of love, yet he told his 
                story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced 
                and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly 
                that Pierre listened to him with curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　It was plain that l'amour which the Frenchman was so fond 
                of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt 
                for his wife, nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself 
                that he experienced for Natasha. (Ramballe despised both these 
                kinds of love equally: the one he considered the &quot;love of 
                clodhoppers&quot; and the other the &quot;love of simpletons.&quot;) 
                L'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in 
                the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination 
                of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love 
                for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time 
                for a charming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching 
                marquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the 
                daughter, ending in the mother's sacrificing herself and offering 
                her daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the captain, 
                though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted 
                an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, 
                and he- the lover- assumed the role of the husband, as well as 
                several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where 
                &quot;shelter&quot; is called Unterkunft and where the husbands 
                eat sauerkraut and the young girls are &quot;too blonde.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain's 
                memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing 
                face, was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, 
                the saving of life continually occurred in the captain's stories) 
                and the Pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne 
                de coeur) while himself entering the French service. The captain 
                was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, 
                but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to 
                the husband, saying as he did so: &quot;I have saved your life, 
                and I save your honor!&quot; Having repeated these words the captain 
                wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the 
                weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.</p>
              <p> 　　Listening to the captain's tales, Pierre- as often happens 
                late in the evening and under the influence of wine- followed 
                all that was told him, understood it all, and at the same time 
                followed a train of personal memories which, he knew not why, 
                suddenly arose in his mind. While listening to these love stories 
                his own love for Natasha unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going 
                over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally 
                compared them with Ramballe's tales. Listening to the story of 
                the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before his eyes 
                every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his 
                love at the Sukharev water tower. At the time of that meeting 
                it had not produced an effect upon him- he had not even once recalled 
                it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something 
                very important and poetic.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you,&quot; 
                he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before 
                him her eyes, her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock 
                of her hair... and there seemed to him something pathetic and 
                touching in all this.</p>
              <p> 　　Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, 
                the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar 
                impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of 
                the legitimate husband.</p>
              <p> 　　Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt 
                a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began 
                to explain that he understood love for a women somewhat differently. 
                He said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only 
                one woman, and that she could never be his.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tiens!&quot; said the captain.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his 
                earliest years, but that he had not dared to think of her because 
                she was too young, and because he had been an illegitimate son 
                without a name. Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth 
                he dared not think of her because he loved her too well, placing 
                her far above everything in the world, and especially therefore 
                above himself.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether 
                he understood that.</p>
              <p> 　　The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did 
                not understand it he begged Pierre to continue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Platonic love, clouds...&quot; he muttered.</p>
              <p> 　　Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, 
                or the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any 
                of those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all 
                these things together, something loosened Pierre's tongue. Speaking 
                thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the 
                whole story of his life: his marriage, Natasha's love for his 
                best friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations 
                with her. Urged on by Ramballe's questions he also told what he 
                had at first concealed- his own position and even his name.</p>
              <p> 　　More than anything else in Pierre's story the captain was 
                impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions 
                in Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the 
                city, but remained there concealing his name and station.</p>
              <p> 　　When it was late at night they went out together into the 
                street. The night was warm and light. To the left of the house 
                on the Pokrovka a fire glowed- the first of those that were beginning 
                in Moscow. To the right and high up in the sky was the sickle 
                of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which 
                was connected in Pierre's heart with his love. At the gate stood 
                Gerasim, the cook, and two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their 
                mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard. 
                They were looking at the glow seen in the town.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire 
                in the immense city.</p>
              <p> 　　Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, 
                and at the glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. 
                &quot;There now, how good it is, what more does one need?&quot; 
                thought he. And suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy 
                and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself 
                from falling.</p>
              <p> 　　Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate 
                with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the 
                sofa and immediately fell asleep. </p>

              <p> 　　In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance 
                he was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded 
                and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with 
                something special of his own. The difference between his former 
                and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what 
                lay before him or was said to him, he had puckered his forehead 
                painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance. 
                At present he still forgot what was said to him and still did 
                not see what was before his eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely 
                perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him 
                and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing and hearing 
                something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted 
                but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid him. 
                Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and 
                sympathy for others, shone in his eyes with a questioning look 
                as to whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt 
                pleased by his presence.</p>
              <p> 　　Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he 
                talked, and seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in 
                conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told 
                him their most intimate secrets.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly 
                hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to 
                him after the old count's death, now after staying a short time 
                in Orel- where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite 
                of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him- felt 
                to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him. 
                Pierre did not in any way seek her approval, he merely studied 
                her with interest. Formerly she had felt that he regarded her 
                with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into herself as 
                she did with others and had shown him only the combative side 
                of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the 
                most intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first 
                but afterwards gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly 
                sides of her character.</p>
              <p> 　　The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence 
                more successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth 
                and showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted 
                simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities 
                of the embittered, hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under 
                the influence of bad people but of people such as myself,&quot; 
                thought she.</p>
              <p> 　　His servants too- Terenty and Vaska- in their own way noticed 
                the change that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that 
                he had become much &quot;simpler.&quot; Terenty, when he had helped 
                him undress and wished him good night, often lingered with his 
                master's boots in his hands and clothes over his arm, to see whether 
                he would not start a talk. And Pierre, noticing that Terenty wanted 
                a chat, generally kept him there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?&quot; he 
                would ask.</p>
              <p> 　　And Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, 
                and of the old count, and would stand for a long time holding 
                the clothes and talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, 
                and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy 
                with his master and affection for him.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, 
                though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man 
                whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity, would sit 
                for hours with Pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his 
                observations on the characters of his patients in general, and 
                especially of the ladies.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not 
                like our provincials,&quot; he would say.</p>
              <p> 　　There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel, 
                and the doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used 
                to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.</p>
              <p> 　　The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, 
                talk with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and 
                his love, and pour out to him his indignation against the French 
                and especially against Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege 
                to fight such a nation,&quot; he said to Pierre. &quot;You, who 
                have suffered so from the French, do not even feel animosity toward 
                them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian 
                merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure 
                in so doing.</p>
              <p> 　　During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel his old Masonic 
                acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge 
                in 1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress 
                who had a large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary 
                post in the commissariat department in that town.</p>
              <p> 　　Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they 
                had never been intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship 
                and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express 
                for one another. Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to 
                meet a man of his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.</p>
              <p> 　　But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had 
                lagged much behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it 
                to himself, into apathy and egotism.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,&quot; he 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it 
                had been formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every 
                day. To Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed 
                strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short 
                time before.</p>
              <p> 　　Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family 
                affairs, his wife's affairs, and his official duties. He regarded 
                all these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that 
                they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of 
                himself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and 
                Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, 
                without trying to change the other's views and without condemning 
                him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual 
                to him, was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, 
                with the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he 
                now met, which gained for him the general good will. This was 
                his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man's convictions 
                by words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, 
                feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This 
                legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite 
                and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt 
                for, and the interest he took in, other people. The difference, 
                and sometimes complete contradiction, between men's opinions and 
                their lives, and between one man and another, pleased him and 
                drew from him an amused and gentle smile.</p>
              <p> 　　In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself 
                a center of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary 
                questions, especially requests for money to which, as an extremely 
                wealthy man, he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless 
                agitation and perplexity. &quot;To give or not to give?&quot; 
                he had asked himself. &quot;I have it and he needs it. But someone 
                else needs it still more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they 
                are both impostors?&quot; In the old days he had been unable to 
                find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who 
                asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been 
                in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question 
                concerning his property, when one person advised one thing and 
                another something else.</p>
              <p> 　　Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either 
                doubt or perplexity about these questions. There was now within 
                him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should 
                or should not be done.</p>
              <p> 　　He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but 
                now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. 
                The first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a French 
                prisoner, a colonel, came to him and, after talking a great deal 
                about his exploits, concluded by making what amounted to a demand 
                that Pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his 
                wife and children. Pierre refused without the least difficulty 
                or effort, and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had 
                been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same 
                time that he refused the colonel's demand he made up his mind 
                that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving Orel, to induce 
                the Italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently 
                in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own more settled outlook 
                on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard 
                to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and 
                near Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up 
                with him his diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost 
                him, according to the head steward's calculation, about two million 
                rubles.</p>
              <p> 　　To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him 
                an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would 
                not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to 
                pay his wife's debts which he was under no obligation to meet, 
                and did not rebuild his Moscow house and the country house on 
                his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a 
                year and brought in nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, of course that's true,&quot; said Pierre with a 
                cheerful smile. &quot;I don't need all that at all. By being ruined 
                I have become much richer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account 
                of the state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect 
                had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, 
                speaking of this as of a settled matter. About the same time he 
                received letters from Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances 
                speaking of his wife's debts. And Pierre decided that the steward's 
                proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must 
                go to Petersburg and settle his wife's affairs and must rebuild 
                in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did not know, but he knew 
                for certain that it was necessary. His income would be reduced 
                by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.</p>
              <p> 　　Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.</p>
              <p> 　　During the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre 
                had experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when 
                during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw 
                hundreds of new faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout 
                his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone- the 
                stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, the peasants on the 
                roads and in the villages- had a new significance for him. The 
                presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the 
                ignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared 
                with Europe only heightened Pierre's pleasure. Where Willarski 
                saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality- 
                the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained 
                the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did 
                not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him- an 
                apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions 
                that could lead to nothing- and he smiled joyfully as he listened 
                to him. </p>

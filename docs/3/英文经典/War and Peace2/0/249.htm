              <p> 　　Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, 
                perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, 
                but it was empty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless 
                hive is empty.</p>
              <p> 　　In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial 
                glance it seems as much alive as other hives.</p>
              <p> 　　The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of 
                the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance 
                it smells of honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in 
                the same way. But one has only to observe that hive to realize 
                that there is no longer any life in it. The bees do not fly in 
                the same way, the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper 
                are not the same. To the beekeeper's tap on the wall of the sick 
                hive, instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens 
                of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed, 
                and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial 
                living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different 
                parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead 
                of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and 
                the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and 
                decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels 
                sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die 
                in defense of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet 
                sound of throbbing activity, like the sound of boiling water, 
                but diverse discordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive 
                long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily. 
                They do not sting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees 
                laden with honey flew into the hive, and they flew out empty; 
                now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower part of 
                the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees- tamed by 
                toil, clinging to one another's legs and drawing out the wax, 
                with a ceaseless hum of labor- that used to hang in long clusters 
                down to the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about 
                separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the 
                hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with 
                the fanning of their wings, there is a floor littered with bits 
                of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their legs, and 
                dead ones that have not been cleared away.</p>
              <p> 　　The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines 
                the super. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap 
                in the combs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful 
                complex structures of the combs, but no longer in their former 
                state of purity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees 
                are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs, and the short 
                home bees, shriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly 
                about without trying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive 
                and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies 
                knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight. 
                Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey 
                an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple 
                of bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, 
                with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead 
                bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner 
                two old bees are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or 
                feeding one another, without themselves knowing whether they do 
                it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third place a crowd of 
                bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and fight and smother 
                it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops from above slowly 
                and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses. The keeper 
                opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells. In 
                place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of 
                bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation, 
                he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. 
                They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they 
                had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. 
                Only a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle 
                on the enemy's hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the 
                rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper 
                closes the hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears 
                out its contents and burns it clean.</p>
              <p> 　　So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, 
                uneasy, and morose, paced up and down in front of the Kammer-Kollezski 
                rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, 
                observance of the proprieties- a deputation.</p>
              <p> 　　In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people 
                aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly 
                aware of what they were doing.</p>
              <p> 　　When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow 
                was empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and 
                silently continued to walk to and fro.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My carriage!&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove 
                into the suburb. &quot;Moscow deserted!&quot; he said to himself. 
                &quot;What an incredible event!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the 
                Dorogomilov suburb.</p>
              <p> 　　The coup de theatre had not come off. </p>

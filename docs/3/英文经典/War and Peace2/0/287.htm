              <p> 　　Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; 
                there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains 
                in the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their 
                ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, 
                and incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. The Russian army, 
                only half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt 
                to attack for a whole month. Napoleon's position is most brilliant. 
                He can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength 
                and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of 
                a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the 
                case of a reverse, return to Smolensk or Vilna; or remain in Moscow; 
                in short, no special genius would seem to be required to retain 
                the brilliant position the French held at that time. For that, 
                only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow the 
                troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing- of which there was 
                sufficient in Moscow for the whole army- and methodically to collect 
                the provisions, of which (according to the French historians) 
                there were enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. 
                Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians 
                declare had control of the army, took none of these steps.</p>
              <p> 　　He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary 
                he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all 
                the courses open to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: 
                wintering in Moscow, advancing on Petersburg or on Nizhni-Novgorod, 
                or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route (say by 
                the road Kutuzov afterwards took), nothing more stupid or disastrous 
                can be imagined than what he actually did. He remained in Moscow 
                till October, letting the troops plunder the city; then, hesitating 
                whether to leave a garrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached 
                Kutuzov without joining battle, turned to the right and reached 
                Malo-Yaroslavets, again without attempting to break through and 
                take the road Kutuzov took, but retiring instead to Mozhaysk along 
                the devastated Smolensk road. Nothing more stupid than that could 
                have been devised, or more disastrous for the army, as the sequel 
                showed. Had Napoleon's aim been to destroy his army, the most 
                skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions 
                that would so completely have accomplished that purpose, independently 
                of anything the Russian army might do.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he 
                destroyed his army because he wished to, or because he was very 
                stupid, would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops 
                to Moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever 
                and a genius.</p>
              <p> 　　In both cases his personal activity, having no more force 
                than the personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with 
                the laws that guided the event.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon's faculties 
                as having weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results 
                did not justify his actions. He employed all his ability and strength 
                to do the best he could for himself and his army, as he had done 
                previously and as he did subsequently in 1813. His activity at 
                that time was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, 
                in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in how 
                far his genius was genuine in Egypt- where forty centuries looked 
                down upon his grandeur- for his great exploits there are all told 
                us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria 
                or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French or 
                German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps 
                without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline 
                Germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the 
                war carried on in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to 
                recognize his genius in order to hide our shame. We have paid 
                for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply, and we 
                will not abandon that right.</p>
              <p> 　　His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius 
                as elsewhere. Order after order order and plan after plan were 
                issued by him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he 
                left it. The absence of citizens and of a deputation, and even 
                the burning of Moscow, did not disconcert him. He did not lose 
                sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the 
                enemy, or of the welfare of the people of Russia, or of the direction 
                of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic considerations concerning 
                the terms of the anticipated peace. </p>

              <p> 　　At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in 
                an annex of his house which had not been burned. He called on 
                Count Rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, 
                and he intended to leave for Petersburg two days later. Everybody 
                was celebrating the victory, everything was bubbling with life 
                in the ruined but reviving city. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, 
                everyone wished to meet him, and everyone questioned him about 
                what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward 
                them all, but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding 
                himself in any way. To all questions put to him- whether important 
                or quite trifling- such as: Where would he live? Was he going 
                to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind 
                taking a parcel for someone?- he replied: &quot;Yes, perhaps,&quot; 
                or, &quot;I think so,&quot; and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　He had heard that the Rostovs were at Kostroma but the thought 
                of Natasha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a 
                pleasant memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only 
                free from social obligations but also from that feeling which, 
                it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself.</p>
              <p> 　　On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskoys 
                that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last 
                days of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's thoughts and 
                now recurred to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner 
                that Princess Mary was in Moscow and living in her house- which 
                had not been burned- in Vozdvizhenka Street, he drove that same 
                evening to see her.</p>
              <p> 　　On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, 
                of their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially 
                of the last one at Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind 
                he was then in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not 
                disclosed to him before he died?&quot; thought Pierre. He recalled 
                Karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these 
                two men, so different, and yet so similar in that they had both 
                lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious 
                mood. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage 
                but its general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met 
                Pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel 
                that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order 
                of things in the house, informed him that the princess had gone 
                to her own apartments, and that she received on Sundays.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the man. &quot;Please step into 
                the portrait gallery.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who 
                brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to 
                see Pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs 
                to her apartment.</p>
              <p> 　　In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and 
                with her another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that 
                the princess always had lady companions, but who they were and 
                what they were like he never knew or remembered. &quot;This must 
                be one of her companions,&quot; he thought, glancing at the lady 
                in the black dress.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, looking at his altered face after 
                he had kissed her hand, &quot;so this is how we meet again. He 
                of spoke of you even at the very last,&quot; she went on, turning 
                her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised 
                him for an instant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first 
                piece of good news we had received for a long time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even 
                more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, 
                but Pierre interrupted her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just imagine- I knew nothing about him!&quot; said he. 
                &quot;I thought he had been killed. All I know I heard at second 
                hand from others. I only know that he fell in with the Rostovs.... 
                What a strange coincidence!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at 
                the companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed 
                on him, and, as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow 
                that this companion in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent 
                creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with Princess 
                Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expressed 
                still greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre's 
                face to that of the lady in the black dress and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you really not recognize her?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked again at the companion's pale, delicate face 
                with its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to 
                him, long forgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those 
                attentive eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But no, it can't be!&quot; he thought. &quot;This stern, 
                thin, pale face that looks so much older! It cannot be she. It 
                merely reminds me of her.&quot; But at that moment Princess Mary 
                said, &quot;Natasha!&quot; And with difficulty, effort, and stress, 
                like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, a smile 
                appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from that opening 
                door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with a happiness 
                he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking- 
                especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped 
                him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible, 
                it was Natasha and he loved her.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess 
                Mary, and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had 
                been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He 
                tried to hide his agitation. But the more he tried to hide it 
                the more clearly- clearer than any words could have done- did 
                he betray to himself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he loved 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's only the unexpectedness of it,&quot; thought 
                Pierre. But as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he 
                had begun with Princess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, and 
                a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation 
                of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He became confused in 
                his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not at 
                all expect to see her there, but he had failed to recognize her 
                because the change in her since he last saw her was immense. She 
                had grown thin and pale, but that was not what made her unrecognizable; 
                she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that 
                face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the 
                joy of life, now when he first entered and glanced at her there 
                was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly 
                attentive and sadly interrogative.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's 
                part, but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her 
                whole face. </p>

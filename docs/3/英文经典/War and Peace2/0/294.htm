              <p> 　　In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutuzov 
                with a letter from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated 
                from Moscow, though Napoleon was already not far from Kutuzov 
                on the old Kaluga road. Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had 
                done to the one formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that there 
                could be no question of peace.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after that a report was received from Dorokhov's guerrilla 
                detachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of Broussier's 
                division had been seen at Forminsk and that being separated from 
                the rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The 
                soldiers and officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, 
                excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tarutino, urged Kutuzov 
                to carry out Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov did not consider any 
                offensive necessary. The result was a compromise which was inevitable: 
                a small detachment was sent to Forminsk to attack Broussier.</p>
              <p> 　　By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be 
                a most difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov- 
                that same modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to 
                us as drawing up plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, 
                showering crosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought 
                to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning- but whom 
                we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all 
                through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. 
                At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the 
                regiments, saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing 
                and not a single general was left in the rear guard. Ill with 
                fever he went to Smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the 
                town against Napoleon's whole army. In Smolensk, at the Malakhov 
                Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he 
                was awakened by the bombardment of the town- and Smolensk held 
                out all day long. At the battle of Borodino, when Bagration was 
                killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen 
                and the full force of the French artillery fire was directed against 
                it, the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning 
                Dokhturov- Kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made 
                by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little Dokhturov 
                rode thither, and Borodino became the greatest glory of the Russian 
                army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose, 
                but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from 
                there to Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with 
                the French was fought and where the obvious disintegration of 
                the French army began; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes 
                of that period of the campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very 
                little is said and that dubiously. And this silence about Dokhturov 
                is the clearest testimony to his merit.</p>
              <p> 　　It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings 
                of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it 
                by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about 
                in it is its most important part. The man who does not understand 
                the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small 
                connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most 
                essential parts of the machine, and not the shaving which merely 
                harms and hinders the working.</p>
              <p> 　　On the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to 
                Forminsk and stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing faithfully 
                to execute the orders he had received, the whole French army having, 
                in its convulsive movement, reached Murat's position apparently 
                in order to give battle- suddenly without any reason turned off 
                to the left onto the new Kaluga road and began to enter Forminsk, 
                where only Broussier had been till then. At that time Dokhturov 
                had under his command, besides Dorokhov's detachment, the two 
                small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslavin.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening of October 11 Seslavin came to the Aristovo 
                headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner 
                said that the troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the 
                vanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole 
                army had left Moscow four days previously. That same evening a 
                house serf who had come from Borovsk said he had seen an immense 
                army entering the town. Some Cossacks of Dokhturov's detachment 
                reported having sighted the French Guards marching along the road 
                to Borovsk. From all these reports it was evident that where they 
                had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole 
                French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected direction- along 
                the Kaluga road. Dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action, 
                as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had been 
                ordered to attack Forminsk. But only Broussier had been there 
                at that time and now the whole French army was there. Ermolov 
                wished to act on his own judgment, but Dokhturov insisted that 
                he must have Kutuzov's instructions. So it was decided to send 
                a dispatch to the staff.</p>
              <p> 　　For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, 
                who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides 
                delivering a written report. Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov, having 
                received the dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to 
                the General Staff accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.</p>

              <p> 　　When Ermolov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position, 
                told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before 
                Moscow and that they must retreat, Kutuzov looked at him in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give me your hand,&quot; said he and, turning it over 
                so as to feel the pulse, added: &quot;You are not well, my dear 
                fellow. Think what you are saying!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating 
                beyond Moscow without a battle.</p>
              <p> 　　On the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomilov gate 
                of Moscow, Kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench 
                by the roadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, 
                and Count Rostopchin, who had come out from Moscow, joined them. 
                This brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed 
                the advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of 
                the army, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military 
                questions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the 
                purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this 
                was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with 
                public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it 
                was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general 
                matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among 
                all these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves 
                at the height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while 
                talking among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in 
                chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to 
                speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in chief listened 
                to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their 
                remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or 
                express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one 
                or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air 
                of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of anything 
                he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been chosen, 
                criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity 
                of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had been 
                made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days 
                before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was 
                described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. 
                (This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the 
                Russian army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering 
                the possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count 
                Rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to 
                die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital, 
                but that he still could not help regretting having been left in 
                ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it sooner 
                things would have been different.... A fifth group, displaying 
                the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed the direction 
                the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was talking absolute 
                nonsense. Kutuzov's expression grew more and more preoccupied 
                and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that to 
                defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning 
                of those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if 
                any senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion 
                would result but the battle would still not take place. It would 
                not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized 
                the position to be impossible, but in their conversations were 
                only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment. 
                How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle 
                they considered it impossible to hold? The lower-grade officers 
                and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the position 
                impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced 
                as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position 
                being defended and others still discussed it, the question was 
                no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes 
                and intrigue. This Kutuzov knew well.</p>
              <p> 　　Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his 
                Russian patriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) 
                by insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear 
                as daylight to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame 
                on Kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills 
                without giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as 
                his own; or if battle were not given, to clear himself of the 
                crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy 
                the old man's mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to 
                that question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for 
                him now was: &quot;Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, 
                and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday 
                when I ordered Platov to retreat, or was it the evening before, 
                when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it 
                earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? 
                Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order 
                to do so must be given.&quot; To give that terrible order seemed 
                to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not 
                only did he love power to which he was accustomed (the honours 
                awarded to Prince Prozorovski, under whom he had served in Turkey, 
                galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save 
                Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor's wish and by 
                the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. 
                He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army 
                in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he 
                alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and 
                he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. 
                But something had to be decided, and these conversations around 
                him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　He called the most important generals to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,&quot; 
                said he, rising from the bench, and he rode to Fili where his 
                carriages were waiting. </p>

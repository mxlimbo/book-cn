              <p> 　　On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the 
                morning sat Kutuzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. 
                He gave no orders, but only assented to or dissented from what 
                others suggested.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, do that,&quot; he replied to various proposals. 
                &quot;Yes, yes: go, dear boy, and have a look,&quot; he would 
                say to one or another of those about him; or, &quot;No, don't, 
                we'd better wait!&quot; He listened to the reports that were brought 
                him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of 
                him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were 
                not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in 
                something else- in the expression of face and tone of voice of 
                those who were reporting. By long years of military experience 
                he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible 
                for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling 
                with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is decided 
                not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where 
                the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered 
                men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army, 
                and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was 
                in his power.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov's general expression was one of concentrated quiet 
                attention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it 
                difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.</p>
              <p> 　　At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured 
                by the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was 
                wounded. Kutuzov groaned and swayed his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about 
                it exactly,&quot; he said to one of his adjutants, and then turned 
                to the Duke of Wurttemberg who was standing behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will Your Highness please take command of the first 
                army?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after the duke's departure- before he could possibly 
                have reached Semenovsk- his adjutant came back from him and told 
                Kutuzov that the duke asked for more troops.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take 
                over the command of the first army, and a request to the duke- 
                whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment- to 
                return to him. When they brought him news that Murat had been 
                taken prisoner, and the staff officers congratulated him, Kutuzov 
                smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait a little, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;The battle 
                is won, and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. 
                Still, it is better to wait before we rejoice.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.</p>
              <p> 　　When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news 
                that the French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk, 
                Kutuzov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin's 
                looks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, 
                taking Scherbinin's arm, led him aside.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, my dear fellow,&quot; he said to Ermolov, &quot;and 
                see whether something can't be done.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position. 
                The attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been 
                several times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond 
                Borodino, and on their left flank Uvarov's cavalry had put the 
                French to flight.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward three o'clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces 
                of all who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood 
                around him, Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. 
                He was satisfied with the day's success- a success exceeding his 
                expectations, but the old man's strength was failing him. Several 
                times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed 
                off. Dinner was brought him.</p>
              <p> 　　Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince 
                Andrew had said, &quot;the war should be extended widely,&quot; 
                and whom Bagration so detested, rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner. 
                Wolzogen had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress 
                of affairs on the left flank. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, 
                seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear 
                of the army, weighed all the circumstances, concluded that the 
                battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the commander 
                in chief with that news.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty 
                and glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their 
                puckering lids.</p>
              <p> 　　Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov 
                with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching 
                the peak of his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance 
                intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left 
                it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that 
                he knew whom he was dealing with. &quot;Der alte Herr&quot; (as 
                in their own set the Germans called Kutuzov) &quot;is making himself 
                very comfortable,&quot; thought Wolzogen, and looking severely 
                at the dishes in front of Kutuzov he began to report to &quot;the 
                old gentleman&quot; the position of affairs on the left flank 
                as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the points of our position are in the enemy's hands 
                and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running 
                away and it is impossible to stop them,&quot; he reported.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, 
                as if not understand what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing 
                &quot;the old gentleman's&quot; agitation, said with a smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have not considered it right to conceal from your 
                Serene Highness what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have seen? You have seen?...&quot; Kutuzov shouted 
                frowning, and rising quickly he went up to Wolzogen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How... how dare you!...&quot; he shouted, choking and 
                making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms: &quot;How 
                dare you, sir, say that to me? You know nothing about it. Tell 
                General Barclay from me that his information is incorrect and 
                that the real course of the battle is better known to me, the 
                commander in chief, than to him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutuzov interrupted 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated 
                on the right flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow 
                yourself to say what you don't know! Be so good as to ride to 
                General Barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack 
                the enemy tomorrow,&quot; said Kutuzov sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy 
                breathing of the panting old general.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God 
                and our brave army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall 
                drive him from the sacred soil of Russia,&quot; said Kutuzov crossing 
                himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped 
                silently aside, marveling at &quot;the old gentleman's&quot; conceited 
                stupidity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, here he is, my hero!&quot; said Kutuzov to a portly, 
                handsome, dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.</p>
              <p> 　　This was Raevski, who had spent the whole day at the most 
                important part of the field of Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their 
                ground and that the French no longer ventured to attack.</p>
              <p> 　　After hearing him, Kutuzov said in French:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then you do not think, like some others, that we must 
                retreat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions 
                it is always the most stubborn who remain victors,&quot; replied 
                Raevski, &quot;and in my opinion...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kaysarov!&quot; Kutuzov called to his adjutant. &quot;Sit 
                down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,&quot; 
                he continued, addressing another, &quot;ride along the line and 
                that tomorrow we attack.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While Kutuzov was talking to Raevski and dictating the order 
                of the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General 
                Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field 
                marshal had given.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for 
                the order to be written out which the former commander in chief, 
                to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.</p>
              <p> 　　And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains 
                throughout an army one and the same temper, known as &quot;the 
                spirit of the army,&quot; and which constitutes the sinew of war, 
                Kutuzov's words, his order for a battle next day, immediately 
                became known from one end of the army to the other.</p>
              <p> 　　It was far from being the same words or the same order that 
                reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from 
                mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble 
                what Kutuzov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere 
                because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, 
                but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief's soul as 
                in that of every Russian.</p>
              <p> 　　And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, 
                and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they 
                wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted 
                and inspirited.</p>

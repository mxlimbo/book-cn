              <p> 　　After the encounter at Vyazma, where Kutuzov had been unable 
                to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut 
                off the enemy and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, 
                and of the Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Krasnoe 
                without a battle. The flight was so rapid that the Russian army 
                pursuing the French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery 
                horses broke down, and the information received of the movements 
                of the French was never reliable.</p>
              <p> 　　The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous 
                marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could 
                not go any faster.</p>
              <p> 　　To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it 
                is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, 
                while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after 
                Tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which 
                left that place a hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with 
                only fifty thousand.</p>
              <p> 　　The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive 
                to our army as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only 
                difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no 
                such threat of destruction as hung over the French, and that the 
                sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick 
                Russians left behind were among their own people. The chief cause 
                of the wastage of Napoleon's army was the rapidity of its movement, 
                and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of 
                the Russian army.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check 
                the movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by 
                the Russian army generals, directed his whole activity here, as 
                he had done at Tarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing 
                the movement of our army.</p>
              <p> 　　But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution 
                of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, 
                another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented 
                itself to Kutuzov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the 
                French. The road the French would take was unknown, and so the 
                closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they 
                had to cover. Only by following at some distance could one cut 
                across the zigzag path of the French. All the artful maneuvers 
                suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and 
                a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable aim 
                was to shorten those marches. To that end Kutuzov's activity was 
                directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vilna- not casually 
                or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated 
                from it.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov felt and knew- not by reasoning or science but with 
                the whole of his Russian being- what every Russian soldier felt: 
                that the French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must 
                be driven out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized 
                all the hardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled 
                for such a time of the year.</p>
              <p> 　　But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian 
                army, who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, 
                and for some reason to capture a king or a duke- it seemed that 
                now- when any battle must be horrible and senseless- was the very 
                time to fight and conquer somebody. Kutuzov merely shrugged his 
                shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers 
                to be made with those soldiers- ill-shod, insufficiently clad, 
                and half starved- who within a month and without fighting a battle 
                had dwindled to half their number, and who at the best if the 
                flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they 
                had already traversed, before they reached the frontier.</p>
              <p> 　　This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, 
                and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians 
                stumbled on the French army.</p>
              <p> 　　So it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to find one of the 
                three French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself 
                with sixteen thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's efforts to avoid 
                that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre 
                of the broken mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued 
                at Krasnoe for three days.</p>
              <p> 　　Toll wrote a disposition: &quot;The first column will march 
                to so and so,&quot; etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord 
                with the disposition. Prince Eugene of Wurttemberg fired from 
                a hill over the French crowds that were running past, and demanded 
                reinforcements which did not arrive. The French, avoiding the 
                Russians, dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night, 
                making their way round as best they could, and continued their 
                flight.</p>
              <p> 　　Miloradovich, who said he did not want to know anything about 
                the commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be 
                found when he was wanted- that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche* 
                as he styled himself- who was fond of parleys with the French, 
                sent envoys demanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not 
                do what he was ordered to do. </p>
              <p> 　　*Knight without fear and without reproach. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I give you that column, lads,&quot; he said, riding 
                up to the troops and pointing out the French to the cavalry.</p>
              <p> 　　And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that 
                could scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented 
                to them- that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold, 
                frost-bitten, and starving- and the column that had been presented 
                to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been 
                anxious to do.</p>
              <p> 　　At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several 
                hundred cannon, and a stick called a &quot;marshal's staff,&quot; 
                and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased 
                with their achievement- though they much regretted not having 
                taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, 
                and reproached one another and especially Kutuzov for having failed 
                to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind 
                tools of the most melancholy law of necessity, but considered 
                themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a 
                most noble and honorable deed. They blamed Kutuzov and said that 
                from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their 
                vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought nothing but satisfying his 
                passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories because 
                he was comfortable there, that at Krasnoe he checked the advance 
                because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost 
                his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding 
                with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　Not only did his contempories, carried away by their passions, 
                talk in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon 
                as grand, while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, 
                dissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite- 
                a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name.</p>

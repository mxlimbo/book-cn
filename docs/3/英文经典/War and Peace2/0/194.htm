              <p> 　　Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's estate, lay forty 
                miles east from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to 
                Alpatych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her 
                that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps 
                to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew's letter it was 
                evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully 
                advised her to send a letter by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor 
                at Smolensk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and 
                the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles 
                wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed 
                it, and it was given to Alpatych with instructions to hand it 
                to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there 
                was danger.</p>
              <p> 　　Having received all his orders Alpatych, wearing a white beaver 
                hat- a present from the prince- and carrying a stick as the prince 
                did, went out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans 
                stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.</p>
              <p> 　　The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness 
                stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to 
                drive with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpatych liked 
                to have them. His satellites- the senior clerk, a countinghouse 
                clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, 
                the coachman, and various domestic serfs- were seeing him off.</p>
              <p> 　　His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to 
                sit on and behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a 
                small bundle, and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! There! Women's fuss! Women, women!&quot; said 
                Alpatych, puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did, 
                and he climbed into the trap.</p>
              <p> 　　After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpatych, 
                not trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his 
                bald head and crossed himself three times.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If there is anything... come back, Yakov Alpatych! For 
                Christ's sake think of us!&quot; cried his wife, referring to 
                the rumors of war and the enemy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Women, women! Women's fuss!&quot; muttered Alpatych 
                to himself and started on his journey, looking round at the fields 
                of yellow rye and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at 
                other quite black fields just being plowed a second time.</p>
              <p> 　　As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid 
                crop of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and 
                there were already being reaped, made his calculations as to the 
                sowing and the harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten 
                any of the prince's orders.</p>
              <p> 　　Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the 
                town toward evening on the fourth of August.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops 
                on the road. As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of 
                distant firing, but these did not impress him. What struck him 
                most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp 
                had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers, 
                evidently for fodder. This fact impressed Alpatych, but in thinking 
                about his own business he soon forgot it.</p>
              <p> 　　All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had 
                been bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond 
                that limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the 
                prince's orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August 
                he put up in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn 
                kept by Ferapontov, where he had been in the habit of putting 
                up for the last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, 
                by Alpatych's advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun 
                to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer's shop 
                in that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the 
                forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs 
                over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.</p>
              <p> 　　Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was 
                standing before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing 
                Alpatych he went up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You're welcome, Yakov Alpatych. Folks are leaving the 
                town, but you have come to it,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are they leaving the town?&quot; asked Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid 
                of the French.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Women's fuss, women's fuss!&quot; said Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: orders 
                have been given not to let them in, so that must be right. And 
                the peasants are asking three rubles for carting- it isn't Christian!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar 
                and for hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went 
                to bed.</p>
              <p> 　　All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning 
                Alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on 
                business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already 
                hot. &quot;A good day for harvesting,&quot; thought Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. 
                At eight o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound 
                of musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and 
                there were many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen 
                stood at their shops, and service was being held in the churches 
                as usual. Alpatych went to the shops, to government offices, to 
                the post office, and to the Governor's. In the offices and shops 
                and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and 
                about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody 
                was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one 
                another.</p>
              <p> 　　In front of the Governor's house Alpatych found a large number 
                of people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor's. 
                At the porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. 
                This man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's no joke, you know! It's all very well if you're 
                single. 'One man though undone is but one,' as the proverb says, 
                but with thirteen in your family and all the property... They've 
                brought us to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do 
                that? They ought to be hanged- the brigands!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh come, that's enough!&quot; said the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do I care? Let him hear! We're not dogs,&quot; 
                said the ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To see the Governor by his excellency's order,&quot; 
                answered Alpatych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his 
                hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned 
                the prince.... He has ordered me to inquire into the position 
                of affairs,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, go and find out!&quot; shouted the angry gentleman. 
                &quot;They've brought things to such a pass that there are no 
                carts or anything!... There it is again, do you hear?&quot; said 
                he, pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They've brought us all to ruin... the brigands!&quot; 
                he repeated, and descended the porch steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting 
                room were tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at 
                one another. The door of the Governor's room opened and they all 
                rose and moved forward. An official ran out, said some words to 
                a merchant, called a stout official with a cross hanging on his 
                neck to follow him, and vanished again, evidently wishing to avoid 
                the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him. Alpatych moved 
                forward and next time the official came out addressed him, one 
                hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat, and handed him 
                two letters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince 
                Bolkonski,&quot; he announced with such solemnity and significance 
                that the official turned to him and took the letters.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly 
                said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: 
                I acted on the highest instructions- here...&quot; and he handed 
                a paper to Alpatych. &quot;Still, as the prince is unwell my advice 
                is that they should go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform 
                them...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer 
                ran into the room and began to say something in French. The Governor's 
                face expressed terror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go,&quot; he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and 
                began questioning the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpatych 
                when he came out of the Governor's room. Involuntarily listening 
                now to the firing, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in 
                strength, Alpatych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him 
                by the Governor said this: </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the 
                slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened 
                with any. I from the one side and Prince Bagration from the other 
                are marching to unite our forces before Smolensk, which junction 
                will be effected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their 
                united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted 
                to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies 
                of our Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks 
                has perished. From this you will see that you have a perfect right 
                to reassure the inhabitants of Smolensk, for those defended by 
                two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.&quot; (Instructions 
                from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolensk, 
                1812.) </p>
              <p> 　　People were anxiously roaming about the streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards 
                kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the 
                streets. Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov's 
                and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small 
                watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual 
                and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. 
                The coachman was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, 
                and went into the passage. From the host's room came the sounds 
                of a child crying, the despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse 
                angry shouting of Ferapontov. The cook began running hither and 
                thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as Alpatych 
                entered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat 
                her... dragged her about so!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What for?&quot; asked Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She kept begging to go away. She's a woman! 'Take me 
                away,' says she, 'don't let me perish with my little children! 
                Folks,' she says, 'are all gone, so why,' she says, 'don't we 
                go?' And he began beating and pulling her about so!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and not 
                wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the 
                innkeeper's, where he had left his purchases.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You brute, you murderer!&quot; screamed a thin, pale 
                woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from 
                her head, burst through the door at that moment and down the steps 
                into the yard.</p>
              <p> 　　Ferapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych adjusted 
                his waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych 
                into the opposite room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Going already?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted 
                his packages and asked how much he owed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor's?&quot; 
                asked Ferapontov. &quot;What has been decided?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything 
                definite.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With our business, how can we get away?&quot; said Ferapontov. 
                &quot;We'd have to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and 
                I tell them they're not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, 
                did a good stroke last Thursday- sold flour to the army at nine 
                rubles a sack. Will you have some tea?&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov 
                over their tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the 
                good weather for harvesting.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, it seems to be getting quieter,&quot; remarked 
                Ferapontov, finishing his third cup of tea and getting up. &quot;Ours 
                must have got the best of it. The orders were not to let them 
                in. So we're in force, it seems.... They say the other day Matthew 
                Ivanych Platov drove them into the river Marina and drowned some 
                eighteen thousand in one day.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman 
                who had come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise 
                of wheels, hoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little 
                trap passed out.</p>
              <p> 　　It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in 
                shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked 
                out of the window and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound 
                of a far-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom 
                of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.</p>
              <p> 　　He went out into the street: two men were running past toward 
                the bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the 
                thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. 
                But these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise 
                of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention 
                from the inhabitants. The town was being bombarded by a hundred 
                and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after four o'clock. 
                The people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment.</p>
              <p> 　　At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused 
                curiosity. Ferapontov's wife, who till then had not ceased wailing 
                under the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went 
                to the gate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at 
                the people.</p>
              <p> 　　The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively 
                curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as 
                they flew over their heads. Several people came round the corner 
                talking eagerly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What force!&quot; remarked one. &quot;Knocked the roof 
                and ceiling all to splinters!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Routed up the earth like a pig,&quot; said another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's grand, it bucks one up!&quot; laughed the first. 
                &quot;Lucky you jumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls 
                had fallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, 
                now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with 
                the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people's 
                heads incessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. 
                Alpatych was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the 
                gate.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; he shouted to the cook, 
                who in her red skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare 
                elbows, had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What marvels!&quot; she exclaimed, but hearing her master's 
                voice she turned back. pulling down her tucked-up skirt.</p>
              <p> 　　Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping 
                downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of 
                the street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in 
                smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Scoundrel, what are you doing?&quot; shouted the innkeeper, 
                rushing to the cook.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from 
                different sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people 
                crowded silently with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound 
                in that crowd was her wailing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don't let me die! 
                My good souls!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, 
                with her thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into 
                the kitchen. Alpatych, his coachman, Ferapontov's wife and children 
                and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. 
                The roar of guns, the whistling of projectiles, and the piteous 
                moaning of the cook, which rose above the other sounds, did not 
                cease for a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and 
                when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what 
                had become of her husband who had remained in the street. A shopman 
                who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to 
                the cathedral, whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon 
                of Smolensk.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych left 
                the cellar and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had 
                been so clear was clouded with smoke, through which, high up, 
                the sickle of the new moon shone strangely. Now that the terrible 
                din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town, 
                broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the moaning, the distant 
                cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere. 
                The cook's moans had now subsided. On two sides black curling 
                clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through the streets 
                soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different 
                directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them ran 
                into Ferapontov's yard before Alpatych's eyes. Alpatych went out 
                to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked 
                the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Noticing him, an officer said: &quot;The town is being abandoned. 
                Get away, get away!&quot; and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll teach you to run into the yards!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and 
                told him to set off. Ferapontov's whole household came out too, 
                following Alpatych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent 
                till then, suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires- 
                the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing 
                twilight- and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was 
                heard from other parts of the street. Inside the shed Alpatych 
                and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their 
                horses with trembling hands.</p>
              <p> 　　As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers 
                in Ferapontov's open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags 
                and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapontov 
                returned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about 
                to shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, 
                burst into sobs and laughter:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Loot everything, lads! Don't let those devils get it!&quot; 
                he cried, taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them 
                into the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others 
                went on filling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, Ferapontov turned 
                to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Russia is done for!&quot; he cried. &quot;Alpatych, 
                I'll set the place on fire myself. We're done for!...&quot; and 
                Ferapontov ran into the yard.</p>
              <p> 　　Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street 
                blocking it completely, so that Alpatych could not pass out and 
                had to wait. Ferapontov's wife and children were also sitting 
                in a cart waiting till it was it was possible to drive out.</p>
              <p> 　　Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon 
                shone out amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent 
                to the Dnieper Alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife, 
                which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other 
                vehicles, had to stop. In a side street near the crossroads where 
                the vehicles had stopped, a house and some shops were on fire. 
                This fire was already burning itself out. The flames now died 
                down and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared up 
                again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces 
                of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures flitted 
                about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of 
                the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his 
                trap would not be able to move on for some time, Alpatych got 
                down and turned into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers 
                were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he 
                saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams 
                into another yard across the street, while others carried bundles 
                of hay.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn 
                which was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the 
                back wall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the 
                rafters were alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the 
                roof to fall in, and Alpatych watched for it too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Alpatych!&quot; a familiar voice suddenly hailed the 
                old man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mercy on us! Your excellency!&quot; answered Alpatych, 
                immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, 
                was looking at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your... your excellency,&quot; stammered Alpatych and 
                broke into sobs. &quot;Are we really lost? Master!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Prince Andrew repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's 
                pale worn face. Alpatych told how he had been sent there and how 
                difficult it was to get away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are we really quite lost, your excellency?&quot; he 
                asked again.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising 
                his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote 
                to his sister: </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied 
                by the enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let 
                me know at once when you will start. Send by special messenger 
                to Usvyazh.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Having written this and given the paper to Alpatych, he told 
                him how to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, 
                his son, and the boy's tutor, and how and where to let him know 
                immediately. Before he had had time to finish giving these instructions, 
                a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a colonel?&quot; shouted the chief of staff 
                with a German accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. &quot;Houses 
                are set on fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this 
                mean? You will answer for it!&quot; shouted Berg, who was now 
                assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank 
                of the infantry of the first army, a place, as Berg said, &quot;very 
                agreeable and well en evidence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking 
                to Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, 
                and if by the tenth I don't receive news that they have all got 
                away I shall have to throw up everything and come myself to Bald 
                Hills.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Prince,&quot; said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, 
                &quot;I only spoke because I have to obey orders, because I always 
                do obey exactly.... You must please excuse me,&quot; he went on 
                apologetically.</p>
              <p> 　　Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a 
                moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. 
                There was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ou-rou-rou!&quot; yelled the crowd, echoing the crash 
                of the collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which 
                diffused a cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, 
                lighting the animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's fine, lads! Now it's raging... It's fine!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's the owner himself,&quot; cried several voices.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then,&quot; continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, 
                &quot;report to them as I have told you&quot;; and not replying 
                a word to Berg who was now mute beside him, he touched his horse 
                and rode down the side street.</p>

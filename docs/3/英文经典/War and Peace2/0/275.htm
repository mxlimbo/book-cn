              <p> 　　After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of 
                the prisoners and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled 
                church.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two 
                soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now 
                go to the barracks for the prisoners of war. Without understanding 
                what was said to him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. 
                They took him to the upper end of the field, where there were 
                some sheds built of charred planks, beams, and battens, and led 
                him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty different men 
                surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding who 
                they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He 
                heard what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the 
                words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them. 
                He replied to questions they put to him, but did not consider 
                who was listening to his replies, nor how they would understand 
                them. He looked at their faces and figures, but they all seemed 
                to him equally meaningless.</p>
              <p> 　　From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders 
                committed by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if 
                the mainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which 
                made everything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and 
                everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though 
                he did not acknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering 
                of the universe, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had 
                been destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly 
                as now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had 
                been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his 
                heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those 
                doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that the 
                universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins 
                remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it 
                was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.</p>
              <p> 　　Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently 
                something about him interested them greatly. They were telling 
                him something and asking him something. Then they led him away 
                somewhere, and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed 
                among men who were laughing and talking on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, mates... that very prince who...&quot; some 
                voice at the other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis 
                on the word who.</p>
              <p> 　　Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the 
                wall, Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But 
                as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face 
                of the factory lad- especially dreadful because of its simplicity- 
                and the faces of the murderers, even more dreadful because of 
                their disquiet. And he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly 
                into the darkness around him.</p>
              <p> 　　Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose 
                presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration 
                which came from him every time he moved. This man was doing something 
                to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see his 
                face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing 
                used to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his 
                leg bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre's interest.</p>
              <p> 　　Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he 
                carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other 
                leg, glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string 
                the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In 
                this way, having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular 
                motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly, the 
                man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then 
                he took out a knife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it 
                under the head of his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped 
                his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. 
                The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and 
                well rounded in these deft movements, in the man's well-ordered 
                arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he 
                looked at the man without taking his eyes from him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?&quot; the little 
                man suddenly said.</p>
              <p> 　　And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong 
                voice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he 
                felt tears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre 
                no time to betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same 
                pleasant tones:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, lad, don't fret!&quot; said he, in the tender singsong 
                caressing voice old Russian peasant women employ. &quot;Don't 
                fret, friend- 'suffer an hour, live for an age!' that's how it 
                is, my dear fellow. And here we live, thank heaven, without offense. 
                Among these folk, too, there are good men as well as bad,&quot; 
                said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees with a supple 
                movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of the 
                shed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, you rascal!&quot; Pierre heard the same kind voice 
                saying at the other end of the shed. &quot;So you've come, you 
                rascal? She remembers... Now, now, that'll do!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping 
                up at him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he 
                had something wrapped in a rag.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here, eat a bit, sir,&quot; said he, resuming his former 
                respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked 
                potatoes. &quot;We had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes 
                seemed extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began 
                to eat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, are they all right?&quot; said the soldier with 
                a smile. &quot;You should do like this.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato 
                into two equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some 
                salt on it from the rag, and handed it to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The potatoes are grand!&quot; he said once more. &quot;Eat 
                some like that!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I'm all right,&quot; said he, &quot;but why did 
                they shoot those poor fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tss, tt...!&quot; said the little man. &quot;Ah, what 
                a sin... what a sin!&quot; he added quickly, and as if his words 
                were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily 
                he went on: &quot;How was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I didn't think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,&quot; 
                replied Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me 
                there, and tried me as an incendiary.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where there's law there's injustice,&quot; put in the 
                little man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And have you been here long?&quot; Pierre asked as he 
                munched the last of the potato.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital 
                in Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, are you a soldier then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was 
                dying of fever. We weren't told anything. There were some twenty 
                of us lying there. We had no idea, never guessed at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you feel sad here?&quot; Pierre inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the 
                surname is Karataev,&quot; he added, evidently wishing to make 
                it easier for Pierre to address him. &quot;They call me 'little 
                falcon' in the regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? Moscow- 
                she's the mother of cities. How can one see all this and not feel 
                sad? But 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first'; that's 
                what the old folks used to tell us,&quot; he added rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What did you say?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who? I?&quot; said Karataev. &quot;I say things happen 
                not as we plan but as God judges,&quot; he replied, thinking that 
                he was repeating what he had said before, and immediately continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a 
                house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your 
                old parents, are they still living?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that 
                a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as 
                he put these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, 
                especially that he had no mother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but 
                there's none as dear as one's own mother!&quot; said he. &quot;Well, 
                and have you little ones?&quot; he went on asking.</p>
              <p> 　　Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him, and 
                he hastened to add:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind! You're young folks yet, and please God may 
                still have some. The great thing is to live in harmony....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's all the same now,&quot; Pierre could not help 
                saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear fellow!&quot; rejoined Karataev, &quot;never 
                decline a prison or a beggar's sack!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently 
                preparing to tell a long story.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,&quot; 
                he began. &quot;We had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, 
                we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for. 
                When Father and we went out mowing there were seven of us. We 
                lived well. We were real peasants. It so happened...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into 
                someone's copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, 
                had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, lad,&quot; and a smile changed the tone of his 
                voice &quot;we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a 
                blessing! If it had not been for my sin, my brother would have 
                had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger brother, had five little 
                ones, while I, you see, only left a wife behind. We had a little 
                girl, but God took her before I went as a soldier. I come home 
                on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and see that they 
                are living better than before. The yard full of cattle, the women 
                at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the 
                youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my children are the same 
                to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if 
                Platon hadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had 
                to go.' called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed 
                us in front of the icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow 
                down to his feet; and you, young woman, you bow down too; and 
                you, grandchildren, also bow down before him! Do you understand?' 
                he says. That's how it is, dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. 
                But we are always judging, 'that's not well- that's not right!' 
                Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it bulges, 
                but when you've drawn it out it's empty! That's how it is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Platon shifted his seat on the straw.</p>
              <p> 　　After a short silence he rose.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I think you must be sleepy,&quot; said he, and 
                began rapidly crossing himself and repeating:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! 
                Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord 
                Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and save us!&quot; he concluded, 
                then bowed to the ground, got up, sighed, and sat down again on 
                his heap of straw. &quot;That's the way. Lay me down like a stone, 
                O God, and raise me up like a loaf,&quot; he muttered as he lay 
                down, pulling his coat over him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What prayer was that you were saying?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh?&quot; murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. 
                &quot;What was I saying? I was praying. Don't you pray?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;But what was that 
                you said: Frola and Lavra?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, of course,&quot; replied Platon quickly, &quot;the 
                horses' saints. One must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! 
                Now you've curled up and got warm, you daughter of a bitch!&quot; 
                said Karataev, touching the dog that lay at his feet, and again 
                turning over he fell asleep immediately.</p>
              <p> 　　Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the 
                distance outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of 
                the shed, but inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre 
                did not sleep, but lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening 
                to the regular snoring of Platon who lay beside him, and he felt 
                that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring 
                in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations.

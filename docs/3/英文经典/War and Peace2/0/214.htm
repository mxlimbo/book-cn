              <p> 　　On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning 
                on his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo 
                at the further end of his regiment's encampment. Through a gap 
                in the broken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row 
                of thirty year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, 
                a field on which shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes 
                near which rose the smoke of campfires- the soldiers' kitchens.</p>
              <p> 　　Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now 
                seemed to him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated 
                and irritable as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　He had received and given the orders for next day's battle 
                and had nothing more to do. But his thoughts- the simplest, clearest, 
                and therefore most terrible thoughts- would give him no peace. 
                He knew that tomorrow's battle would be the most terrible of all 
                he had taken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility 
                of death presented itself to him- not in relation to any worldly 
                matter or with reference to its effect on others, but simply in 
                relation to himself, to his own soul- vividly, plainly, terribly, 
                and almost as a certainty. And from the height of this perception 
                all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly 
                became illumined by a cold white light without shadows, without 
                perspective, without distinction of outline. All life appeared 
                to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing 
                by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those 
                badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. &quot;Yes, 
                yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, 
                and tormented me,&quot; said he to himself, passing in review 
                the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding 
                them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of 
                death. &quot;There they are, those rudely painted figures that 
                once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of society, 
                love of a woman, the Fatherland itself- how important these pictures 
                appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled! 
                And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold white light 
                of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.&quot; The three 
                great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his 
                love for a woman, his father's death, and the French invasion 
                which had overrun half Russia. &quot;Love... that little girl 
                who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, 
                I loved her. I made romantic plans of love and happiness with 
                her! Oh, what a boy I was!&quot; he said aloud bitterly. &quot;Ah 
                me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful 
                to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove in 
                the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler 
                really.... It was all very simple and horrible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place 
                was his: his land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and 
                swept him aside, unconscious of his existence, as he might brush 
                a chip from his path, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell 
                to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial sent from above. What 
                is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return? He 
                is not here! For whom then is the trial intended? The Fatherland, 
                the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps 
                not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men, by a soldier 
                discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday, 
                and the French will come and take me by head and heels and fling 
                me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new 
                conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary 
                to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with 
                their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. &quot;To 
                die... to be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That 
                all this should still be, but no me....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, 
                the smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed 
                and seemed terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. 
                He rose quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.</p>
              <p> 　　After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. 
                &quot;Who's that?&quot; he cried.</p>
              <p> 　　The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov's squadron 
                commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, 
                shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental 
                paymaster.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they 
                had come about, gave them some further instructions, and was about 
                to dismiss them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind 
                the shed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Devil take it!&quot; said the voice of a man stumbling 
                over something.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had 
                tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming 
                his way. It was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of 
                his own set in general, and Pierre especially, for he reminded 
                him of all the painful moments of his last visit to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You? What a surprise!&quot; said he. &quot;What brings 
                you here? This is unexpected!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness- 
                they expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had 
                approached the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew's 
                face he felt constrained and ill at ease.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests 
                me,&quot; said Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated 
                that word &quot;interesting.&quot; &quot;I wish to see the battle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? 
                How would they stop it?&quot; said Prince Andrew sarcastically. 
                &quot;Well, and how's Moscow? And my people? Have they reached 
                Moscow at last?&quot; he asked seriously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me so. I went 
                to see them, but missed them. They have gone to your estate near 
                Moscow.&quot; </p>

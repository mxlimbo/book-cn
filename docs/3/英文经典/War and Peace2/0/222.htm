              <p> 　　Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to 
                the battery, as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing 
                something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. 
                He had no time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior 
                officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he 
                were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers 
                he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting &quot;Brothers!&quot; 
                and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him 
                by the arm. He also saw something else that was strange.</p>
              <p> 　　But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, 
                that the soldier shouting &quot;Brothers!&quot; was a prisoner, 
                and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his 
                eyes, for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, 
                perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, 
                shouting something. Instinctively guarding against the shock- 
                for they had been running together at full speed before they saw 
                one another- Pierre put out his hands and seized the man (a French 
                officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with 
                the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by his 
                collar.</p>
              <p> 　　For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another's 
                unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done 
                and what they were to do next. &quot;Am I taken prisoner or have 
                I taken him prisoner?&quot; each was thinking. But the French 
                officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken 
                prisoner because Pierre's strong hand, impelled by instinctive 
                fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter. The Frenchman 
                was about to say something, when just above their heads, terrible 
                and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre that 
                the French officer's head had been torn off, so swiftly had he 
                ducked it.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further 
                thought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back 
                to the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the 
                dead and wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But 
                before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense 
                crowd of Russian soldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, 
                ran merrily and wildly toward the battery. (This was the attack 
                for which Ermolov claimed the credit, declaring that only his 
                courage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the attack 
                in which he was said to have thrown some St. George's Crosses 
                he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to 
                take who got there.)</p>
              <p> 　　The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops 
                shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot; pursued them so far beyond the battery 
                that it was difficult to call them back.</p>
              <p> 　　The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among 
                them was a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. 
                Crowds of wounded- some known to Pierre and some unknown- Russians 
                and French, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, 
                and were carried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again 
                went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of 
                that family circle which had received him as a member he did not 
                find a single one. There were many dead whom he did not know, 
                but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in the same 
                way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth 
                wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not 
                carry him away.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre ran down the slope once more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at 
                what they have done!&quot; he thought, aimlessly going toward 
                a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield.</p>
              <p> 　　But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in 
                front and especially to the left, near Semenovsk, something seemed 
                to be seething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry 
                did not diminish, but even increased to desperation like a man 
                who, straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.

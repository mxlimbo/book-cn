              <p> 　　Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre 
                got back with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the 
                corner of the Povarskoy. He did not at first recognize the place 
                from which he had set out to look for the child, so crowded was 
                it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the 
                houses. Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from 
                the fire with their belongings, there were several French soldiers 
                in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried 
                to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the 
                daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre felt 
                that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the 
                heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than 
                ever the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had 
                come on him when he ran to save the child. She had now become 
                quiet and, clinging with her little hands to Pierre's coat, sat 
                on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal. He glanced 
                at her occasionally with a slight smile. He fancied he saw something 
                pathetically innocent in that frightened, sickly little face.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had 
                left them. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning 
                the various faces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian 
                or Armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental 
                type, wearing a new, cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, 
                an old woman of similar type, and a young woman. That very young 
                woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty, with 
                her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the extraordinarily 
                soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless face. 
                Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space, she, 
                in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, 
                suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow. She 
                was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman, and 
                looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large, almond-shaped 
                eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware of her 
                beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and, 
                hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at 
                her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding those 
                he sought, he stopped and looked about him.</p>
              <p> 　　With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous 
                than before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered 
                about him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You're of the 
                gentry yourself, aren't you? Whose child is it?&quot; they asked 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black 
                coat who had been sitting there with her other children, and he 
                asked whether anyone knew where she had gone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, that must be the Anferovs,&quot; said an old deacon, 
                addressing a pockmarked peasant woman. &quot;Lord have mercy, 
                Lord have mercy!&quot; he added in his customary bass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Anferovs? No,&quot; said the woman. &quot;They left 
                in the morning. That must be either Mary Nikolievna's or the Ivanovs'!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He says 'a woman,' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady,&quot; 
                remarked a house serf.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know her? She's thin, with long teeth,&quot; 
                said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's Mary Nikolievna! They went inside the garden 
                when these wolves swooped down,&quot; said the woman, pointing 
                to the French soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord, have mercy!&quot; added the deacon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go over that way, they're there. It's she! She kept 
                on lamenting and crying,&quot; continued the woman. &quot;It's 
                she. Here, this way!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some 
                seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away. 
                He was looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers 
                who had gone up to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was 
                wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope. He had a 
                nightcap on his head and his feet were bare. The other, whose 
                appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, 
                fair-haired man, slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression 
                of face. He wore a woman's loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, 
                and large torn Hessian boots. The little barefooted Frenchman 
                in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, 
                immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at 
                once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown 
                stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands 
                in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here, take the child!&quot; said Pierre peremptorily 
                and hurriedly to the woman, handing the little girl to her. &quot;Give 
                her back to them, give her back!&quot; he almost shouted, putting 
                the child, who began screaming, on the ground, and again looking 
                at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman 
                had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against 
                the other. The old man was saying something in a voice broken 
                by sobs, but Pierre caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention 
                was directed to the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, 
                swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the young 
                woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by 
                the neck.</p>
              <p> 　　The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same 
                attitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see 
                or feel what the soldier was doing to her.</p>
              <p> 　　While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him 
                from the Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already 
                tearing from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, 
                and the young woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let that woman alone!&quot; exclaimed Pierre hoarsely 
                in a furious voice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders 
                and throwing him aside.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing 
                down the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Voyons, Pas de betises!&quot;* he cried. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Look here, no nonsense!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered 
                nothing and his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted 
                Frenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked 
                him off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval 
                were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted 
                patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans 
                came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. 
                Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only 
                remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling 
                that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers 
                stood around him and were searching him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lieutenant, he has a dagger,&quot; were the first words 
                Pierre understood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, a weapon?&quot; said the officer and turned to the 
                barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. &quot;All 
                right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.&quot; Then 
                he turned to Pierre. &quot;Do you speak French?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. 
                His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something 
                in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves 
                on both sides of Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you speak French?&quot; the officer asked again, 
                keeping at a distance from Pierre. &quot;Call the interpreter.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the 
                ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once 
                knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He does not look like a common man,&quot; said the interpreter, 
                after a searching look at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,&quot; remarked 
                the officer. &quot;And ask him who he is,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the interpreter in poor Russian. 
                &quot;You must answer the chief.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner- take 
                me!&quot; Pierre suddenly replied in French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, ah!&quot; muttered the officer with a frown. &quot;Well 
                then, march!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre 
                stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when 
                the patrol started she moved forward.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?&quot; said 
                she. &quot;And the little girl, the little girl, what am I to 
                do with her if she's not theirs?&quot; said the woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does that woman want?&quot; asked the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the 
                sight of the little girl he had saved.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does she want?&quot; he murmured. &quot;She is 
                bringing me my daughter whom I have just saved from the flames,&quot; 
                said he. &quot;Good-by!&quot; And without knowing how this aimless 
                lie had escaped him, he went along with resolute and triumphant 
                steps between the French soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various 
                streets of Moscow by Durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage, 
                and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the 
                general opinion which had that day originated among the higher 
                French officers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching 
                through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian 
                suspects: a small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, 
                and a house serf, besides several looters. But of all these various 
                suspected characters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious 
                of all. When they had all been brought for the night to a large 
                house on the Zubov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, 
                Pierre was placed apart under strict guard. </p>

              <p> 　　&quot;She has come to stay with me,&quot; said Princess Mary. 
                &quot;The count and countess will be here in a few days. The countess 
                is in a dreadful state; but it was necessary for Natasha herself 
                to see a doctor. They insisted on her coming with me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?&quot; said 
                Pierre, addressing Natasha. &quot;You know it happened the very 
                day we were rescued. I saw him. What a delightful boy he was!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her 
                eyes widened and lit up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can one say or think of as a consolation?&quot; 
                said Pierre. &quot;Nothing! Why had such a splendid boy, so full 
                of life, to die?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without 
                faith...&quot; remarked Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, that is really true,&quot; Pierre hastily 
                interrupted her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is it true?&quot; Natasha asked, looking attentively 
                into Pierre's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can you ask why?&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;The 
                thought alone of what awaits...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again 
                looked inquiringly at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And because,&quot; Pierre continued, &quot;only one 
                who believes that there is a God ruling us can bear a loss such 
                as hers and... yours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly 
                stopped. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed 
                Princess Mary, asking about his friend's last days.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same 
                time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt 
                that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose 
                judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the 
                world. As he spoke now he was considering what impression his 
                words would make on Natasha. He did not purposely say things to 
                please her, but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary- reluctantly as is usual in such cases- began 
                telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. 
                But Pierre's face quivering with emotion, his questions and his 
                eager restless expression, gradually compelled her to go into 
                details which she feared to recall for her own sake.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, and so...? &quot; Pierre kept saying as he 
                leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to 
                her story. &quot;Yes, yes... so he grew tranquil and softened? 
                With all his soul he had always sought one thing- to be perfectly 
                good- so he could not be afraid of death. The faults he had- if 
                he had any- were not of his making. So he did soften?... What 
                a happy thing that he saw you again,&quot; he added, suddenly 
                turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes 
                for a moment. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or 
                not.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that was happiness,&quot; she then said in her 
                quiet voice with its deep chest notes. &quot;For me it certainly 
                was happiness.&quot; She paused. &quot;And he... he... he said 
                he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered the room....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands 
                on her knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort 
                lifted her head and began to speak rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I 
                did not dare to ask about him. Then suddenly Sonya told me he 
                was traveling with us. I had no idea and could not imagine what 
                state he was in, all I wanted was to see him and be with him,&quot; 
                she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what 
                she had never yet mentioned to anyone- all she had lived through 
                during those three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon 
                her full of tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, 
                nor of death, nor of what she was telling. He listened to her 
                and felt only pity for her, for what she was suffering now while 
                she was speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, 
                sat beside Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of 
                those last days of her brother's and Natasha's love.</p>
              <p> 　　Evidently Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.</p>
              <p> 　　She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate 
                secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. 
                Several times she repeated the same thing twice.</p>
              <p> 　　Dessalles' voice was heard outside the door asking whether 
                little Nicholas might come in to say good night.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, that's all- everything,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to 
                the door which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against 
                it, and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared 
                and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his 
                attention to her nephew who had entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas' face, 
                which resembled his father's, affected Pierre so much that when 
                he had kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, 
                and went to the window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, 
                but she would not let him go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Natasha and I sometimes don't go to sleep till after 
                two, so please don't go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we 
                will come immediately.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: &quot;This 
                is the first time she has talked of him like that.&quot;</p>

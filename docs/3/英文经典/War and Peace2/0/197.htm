              <p> 　　While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already 
                passed Smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. 
                Napoleon's historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying 
                to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow 
                against his will. He is as right as other historians who look 
                for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man; 
                he is as right as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon 
                was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here 
                besides the law of retrospection, which regards all the past as 
                a preparation for events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity 
                comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having 
                lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from 
                a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening, but 
                forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes 
                and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the mistake 
                to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage 
                of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which 
                occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will 
                that manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from 
                innumerable conflicts of various wills!</p>
              <p> 　　After Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh 
                at Vyazma, and then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that 
                owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians 
                could not give battle till they reached Borodino, seventy miles 
                from Moscow. From Vyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on 
                Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville 
                sacree des peuples d'Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises 
                en forme de pagodes chinoises,* this Moscow gave Napoleon's imagination 
                no rest. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode 
                his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his 
                bodyguard, his pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of 
                staff, dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured 
                by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d'Ideville, an interpreter, 
                he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with 
                an amused expression. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the 
                sacred city of Alexander's people, Moscow with its innumerable 
                churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot; asked Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One of Platov's Cossacks says that Platov's corps is 
                joining up with the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed 
                commander in chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse 
                and bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several 
                adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavrushka, the serf 
                Denisov had handed over to Rostov, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly's 
                jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy 
                face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a Cossack?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for 
                Napoleon's plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal 
                to an Oriental mind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme 
                familiarity of the incidents of the war,&quot; says Thiers, narrating 
                this episode. In reality Lavrushka, having got drunk the day before 
                and left his master dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the 
                village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in looting till 
                the French took him prisoner. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, 
                bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider 
                it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready 
                to render any sort of service to their master, and are keen at 
                guessing their master's baser impulses, especially those prompted 
                by vanity and pettiness.</p>
              <p> 　　Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity 
                he had easily and surely recognized, Lavrushka was not in the 
                least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master's 
                favor.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon's presence 
                could no more intimidate him than Rostov's, or a sergeant major's 
                with the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either 
                the sergeant major or Napoleon could deprive him of.</p>
              <p> 　　So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among 
                the orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether 
                the Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka 
                screwed up his eyes and considered.</p>
              <p> 　　In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type 
                see cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's like this,&quot; he said thoughtfully, &quot;if 
                there's a battle soon, yours will win. That's right. But if three 
                days pass, then after that, well, then that same battle will not 
                soon be over.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon 
                thus: &quot;If a battle takes place within the next three days 
                the French will win, but if later, God knows what will happen.&quot; 
                Napoleon did not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, 
                and he ordered these words to be repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　Lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending 
                not to know who Napoleon was, added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten 
                everybody in the world, but we are a different matter...&quot;- 
                without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped 
                out at the end.</p>
              <p> 　　The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, 
                and Bonaparte smiled. &quot;The young Cossack made his mighty 
                interlocutor smile,&quot; says Thiers. After riding a few paces 
                in silence, Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to 
                see how the news that he was talking to the Emperor himself, to 
                that very Emperor who had written his immortally victorious name 
                on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du Don.* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Child of the Don.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka.</p>
              <p> 　　Lavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him 
                and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his 
                new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, 
                opened his eyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put 
                on when taken to be whipped. &quot;As soon as Napoleon's interpreter 
                had spoken,&quot; says Thiers, &quot;the Cossack, seized by amazement, 
                did not utter another word, but rode on, his eyes fixed on the 
                conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the 
                East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by 
                a naive and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after making 
                the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to 
                its native fields.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed 
                to his imagination, and &quot;the bird restored to its native 
                fields&quot; galloped to our outposts, inventing on the way all 
                that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades. 
                What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because 
                it seemed to him not worth telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired 
                for the regiment operating with Platov's detachment and by evening 
                found his master, Nicholas Rostov, quartered at Yankovo. Rostov 
                was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages 
                with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka have another horse and took him along 
                with him.</p>

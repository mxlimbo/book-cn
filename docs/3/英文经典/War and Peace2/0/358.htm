              <p> 　　 The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of 
                a few men, for the connection between those men and the nations 
                has not been found. The theory that this connection is based on 
                the transference of the collective will of a people to certain 
                historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience 
                of history.</p>
              <p> 　　The theory of the transference of the collective will of the 
                people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain 
                of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its 
                application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or 
                civil wars occur- that is, as soon as history begins- that theory 
                explains nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference 
                of the people's will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, 
                the theory can always say that such and such a person took the 
                lead because the collective will was transferred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The replies this theory gives to historical questions are 
                like the replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd 
                of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the 
                pasturage in different parts of the field, or to the driving of 
                the herdsman, should attribute the direction the herd takes to 
                what animal happens to be at its head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The herd goes in that direction because the animal in 
                front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals 
                is vested in that leader.&quot; This is what historians of the 
                first class say- those who assume the unconditional transference 
                of the people's will.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If the animals leading the herd change, this happens 
                because the collective will of all the animals is transferred 
                from one leader to another, according to whether the animal is 
                or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole 
                herd.&quot; Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective 
                will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which 
                they regard as known. (With this method of observation it often 
                happens that the observer, influenced by the direction he himself 
                prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the people's change 
                of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side, or even 
                in the rear.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If the animals in front are continually changing and 
                the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is 
                because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer 
                their will to the animals that have attracted our attention, and 
                to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements 
                of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd.&quot; 
                So say the third class of historians who regard all historical 
                persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of their 
                age.</p>
              <p> 　　The theory of the transference of the will of the people to 
                historic persons is merely a paraphrase- a restatement of the 
                question in other words.</p>
              <p> 　　What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power 
                is the collective will of the people transferred to one person. 
                Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one 
                person? On condition that that person expresses the will of the 
                whole people. That is, power is power: in other words, power is 
                a word the meaning of which we do not understand.</p>
              <p> 　　 If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract 
                reasoning, then having subjected to criticism the explanation 
                of &quot;power&quot; that juridical science gives us, humanity 
                would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence. 
                But to understand phenomena man has, besides abstract reasoning, 
                experience by which he verifies his reflections. And experience 
                tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing 
                phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective 
                activity of men can do without the conception of power, the existence 
                of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary 
                events.</p>
              <p> 　　Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose 
                will the event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues 
                a decree and the French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and 
                Bismarck issue decrees and an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I 
                issues a decree and an army enters Russia. Alexander I gives a 
                command and the French submit to the Bourbons. Experience shows 
                us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will 
                of one or of several men who have decreed it.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging 
                divine intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of 
                events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, 
                but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.</p>
              <p> 　　On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a 
                man's will- his words- are only part of the general activity expressed 
                in an event, as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so 
                without assuming an incomprehensible, supernatural force- a miracle- 
                one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the 
                movements of millions of men. On the other hand, even if we admitted 
                that words could be the cause of events, history shows that the 
                expression of the will of historical personages does not in most 
                cases produce any effect, that is to say, their commands are often 
                not executed, and sometimes the very opposite of what they order 
                occurs.</p>
              <p> 　　Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity 
                we cannot regard &quot;power&quot; as the cause of events.</p>
              <p> 　　Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation 
                that exists between the expression of someone's will and the execution 
                of that will by others.</p>
              <p> 　　To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first 
                establish a conception of the expression of will, referring it 
                to man and not to the Deity.</p>
              <p> 　　If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient 
                history tells us, the expression of that will is independent of 
                time and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled 
                by an event. But speaking of commands that are the expression 
                of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another, 
                to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore: 
                (1) the condition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement 
                in time both of the events and of the person who commands, and 
                (2) the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding 
                and those who execute his command.</p>

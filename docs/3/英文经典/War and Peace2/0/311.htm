              <p> 　　At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going 
                uphill along the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and 
                at the roughness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar 
                crowd around him and then again at his feet. The former and the 
                latter were alike familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged 
                dog ran merrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof 
                of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and 
                hopping along on three, and then again going on all four and rushing 
                to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier 
                and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh 
                of different animals- from men to horses- in various stages of 
                decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing 
                men the dog could eat all it wanted.</p>
              <p> 　　It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at 
                any moment it might cease and the sky clear, but after a short 
                break it began raining harder than before. The saturated road 
                no longer absorbed the water, which ran along the ruts in streams.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his 
                steps in threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally 
                addressing the rain, he repeated: &quot;Now then, now then, go 
                on! Pelt harder!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far 
                down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something 
                important and comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual 
                deduction from a conversation with Karataev the day before.</p>
              <p> 　　At their yesterday's halting place, feeling chilly by a dying 
                campfire, Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was 
                burning better. There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up- 
                head and all- with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling 
                the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice 
                a story Pierre knew. It was already past midnight, the hour when 
                Karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively. 
                When Pierre reached the fire and heard Platon's voice enfeebled 
                by illness, and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, 
                he felt a painful prick at his heart. His feeling of pity for 
                this man frightened him and he wished to go away, but there was 
                no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at Platon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, how are you?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won't grant 
                us death,&quot; replied Platon, and at once resumed the story 
                he had begun.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so, brother,&quot; he continued, with a smile on 
                his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his 
                eyes, &quot; you see, brother...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev had 
                told it to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially 
                joyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to 
                that tale as to something new, and the quiet rapture Karataev 
                evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. 
                The story was of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing 
                life with his family, and who went once to the Nizhni fair with 
                a companion- a rich merchant.</p>
              <p> 　　Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next 
                morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. 
                A bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant's pillow. 
                He was tried, knouted, and his nostrils having been torn off, 
                &quot;all in due form&quot; as Karataev put it, he was sent to 
                hard labor in Siberia.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so, brother&quot; (it was at this point that Pierre 
                came up), &quot;ten years or more passed by. The old man was living 
                as a convict, submitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only 
                he prayed to God for death. Well, one night the convicts were 
                gathered just as we are, with the old man among them. And they 
                began telling what each was suffering for, and how they had sinned 
                against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had taken 
                two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply 
                been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: 
                'What are you being punished for, Daddy?'- 'I, my dear brothers,' 
                said he, 'am being punished for my own and other men's sins. But 
                I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine, 
                but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my 
                dear brothers, and had much property. 'And he went on to tell 
                them all about it in due order. 'I don't grieve for myself,' he 
                says, 'God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my 
                old wife and the children,' and the old man began to weep. Now 
                it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed 
                the other merchant. 'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When, 
                and in what month?' He asked all about it and his heart began 
                to ache. So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down 
                at his feet! 'You are perishing because of me, Daddy,' he says. 
                'It's quite true, lads, that this man,' he says, 'is being tortured 
                innocently and for nothing! I,' he says, 'did that deed, and I 
                put the knife under your head while you were asleep. Forgive me, 
                Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's sake!'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, 
                and he drew the logs together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And the old man said, 'God will forgive you, we are 
                all sinners in His sight. I suffer for my own sins,' and he wept 
                bitter tears. Well, and what do you think, dear friends?&quot; 
                Karataev continued, his face brightening more and more with a 
                rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief 
                charm and the whole meaning of his story: &quot;What do you think, 
                dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. 'I have 
                taken six lives,' he says (he was a great sinner), 'but what I 
                am most sorry for is this old man. Don't let him suffer because 
                of me.' So he confessed and it was all written down and the papers 
                sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while 
                they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in 
                the papers all in due form- the authorities I mean- time passed. 
                The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar's decree came: 
                to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had 
                been awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the 
                old man. 'Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently 
                and in vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!' so they began looking 
                for him,&quot; here Karataev's lower jaw trembled, &quot;but God 
                had already forgiven him- he was dead! That's how it was, dear 
                fellows!&quot; Karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent, 
                gazing before him with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the 
                story itself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous 
                joy that lit up Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic 
                significance of that joy.</p>

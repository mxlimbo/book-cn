              <p> 　　Helene, having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg, 
                found herself in a difficult position.</p>
              <p> 　　In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a 
                grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In 
                Vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince. 
                When she returned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince 
                were there, and both claimed their rights. Helene was faced by 
                a new problem- how to preserve her intimacy with both without 
                offending either.</p>
              <p> 　　What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another 
                woman did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova, 
                who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. 
                Had she attempted concealment, or tried to extricate herself from 
                her awkward position by cunning, she would have spoiled her case 
                by acknowledging herself guilty. But Helene, like a really great 
                man who can do whatever he pleases, at once assumed her own position 
                to be correct, as she sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone 
                else was to blame.</p>
              <p> 　　The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach 
                her, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said 
                firmly: &quot;That's just like a man- selfish and cruel! I expected 
                nothing else. A woman sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, 
                and this is her reward! What right have you, monseigneur, to demand 
                an account of my attachments and friendships? He is a man who 
                has been more than a father to me!&quot; The prince was about 
                to say something, but Helene interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said she, &quot;it may be that he has 
                other sentiments for me than those of a father, but that is not 
                a reason for me to shut my door on him. I am not a man, that I 
                should repay kindness with ingratitude! Know, monseigneur, that 
                in all that relates to my intimate feelings I render account only 
                to God and to my conscience,&quot; she concluded, laying her hand 
                on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But for heaven's sake listen to me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marry me, and I will be your slave!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that's impossible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...&quot; 
                said Helene, beginning to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　The prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught, 
                said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying, 
                that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, 
                but she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), 
                that she had never been her husband's wife, and that she had been 
                sacrificed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But the law, religion...&quot; said the prince, already 
                yielding.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The law, religion... What have they been invented for 
                if they can't arrange that?&quot; said Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred 
                to him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the 
                Society of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.</p>
              <p> 　　A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene 
                gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur 
                de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant 
                black eyes, a Jesuit a robe courte* was presented to her, and 
                in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound 
                of music talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of 
                Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true 
                Catholic religion affords in this world and the next. Helene was 
                touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those 
                of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance, for 
                which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse 
                with her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening 
                Monsieur de Jobert came to see Helene when she was alone, and 
                after that often came again. </p>
              <p> 　　*Lay member of the Society of Jesus. </p>
              <p> 　　One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where 
                she knelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, 
                middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself 
                afterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze 
                wafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la 
                grace.</p>
              <p> 　　After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her. She confessed 
                to him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received 
                a box containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house 
                for her to partake of. A few days later Helene learned with pleasure 
                that she had now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and 
                that in a few days the Pope himself would hear of her and would 
                send her a certain document.</p>
              <p> 　　All that was done around her and to her at this time, all 
                the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed 
                in such pleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity 
                she was now in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons 
                all that time) gave her pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause 
                her for a moment to forget her aim. And as it always happens in 
                contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer 
                ones, Helene- having realized that the main object of all these 
                words and all this trouble was, after converting her to Catholicism, 
                to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to which 
                she received indications)- before parting with her money insisted 
                that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband 
                should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was 
                merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction 
                to human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with 
                her Father Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, 
                in how far was she bound by her marriage?</p>
              <p> 　　They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing 
                room. The scent of flowers came in at the window. Helene was wearing 
                a white dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbe, 
                a well-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm 
                mouth, and white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to 
                Helene and, with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look 
                of delight at her beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as 
                he explained his opinion on the subject. Helene with an uneasy 
                smile looked at his curly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish 
                cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh 
                turn. But the abbe, though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of 
                his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the matter.</p>
              <p> 　　The course of the Father Confessor's arguments ran as follows: 
                &quot;Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking, you 
                made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering 
                the married state without faith in the religious significance 
                of marriage, committed an act of sacrilege. That marriage lacked 
                the dual significance it should have had. Yet in spite of this 
                your vow was binding. You swerved from it. What did you commit 
                by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you 
                acted without evil intention. If now you married again with the 
                object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the 
                question is again a twofold one: firstly...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one 
                of her bewitching smiles: &quot;But I think that having espoused 
                the true religion I cannot be bound by what a false religion laid 
                upon me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The director of her conscience was astounded at having the 
                case presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus' egg. 
                He was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress, 
                but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously 
                constructed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us understand one another, Countess,&quot; said 
                he with a smile, and began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments.

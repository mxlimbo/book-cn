              <p> 　　With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his 
                entry into Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe 
                the movements of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the 
                different roads, and charged Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave 
                careful directions about the fortification of the Kremlin, and 
                drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole 
                map of Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain 
                Yakovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know 
                how to get out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole 
                policy and his magnanimity, and having written a letter to the 
                Emperor Alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform 
                his Friend and Brother that Rostopchin had managed affairs badly 
                in Moscow, he dispatched Yakovlev to Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to 
                Tutolmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires 
                he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel 
                Rostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted 
                a constitution. A municipality was established and the following 
                announcement issued: </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!</p>
              <p> 　　Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and 
                King desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught 
                you how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have 
                been taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public 
                security. A paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, 
                will form your municipality or city government. It will take care 
                of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be 
                distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the 
                mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not 
                on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm.</p>
              <p> 　　The city police is established on its former footing, and 
                better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. 
                The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs 
                of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been 
                appointed to the different wards of the city. You will recognize 
                them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several 
                churches of different denominations are open, and divine service 
                is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow citizens are returning 
                every day to their homes. and orders have been given that they 
                should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes. 
                These are the measures the government has adopted to re-establish 
                order and relieve youp condition. But to achieve this aim it is 
                necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if possible, 
                forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the 
                hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and 
                ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons 
                or on what remains of your property, and finally that you should 
                not doubt that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will 
                of the greatest and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, 
                of whatever nation you may be, re-establish public confidence, 
                the source of the welfare of a state, live like brothers, render 
                mutual aid and protection one to another, unite to defeat the 
                intentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and civil authorities, 
                and your tears will soon cease to flow! </p>
              <p> 　　With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that 
                all the troops in turn should enter Moscow a la maraude* to obtain 
                provisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future 
                provided for. </p>
              <p> 　　*As looters. </p>
              <p> 　　With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be 
                brought back and services to be again performed in the churches.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the 
                following was placarded everywhere: </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 PROCLAMATION!</p>
              <p> 　　You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen 
                whom misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers 
                of the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, 
                listen! Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is 
                being restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly 
                from their hiding places on finding that they are respected. Any 
                violence to them or to their property is promptly punished. His 
                Majesty the Emperor and King protects them, and considers no one 
                among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires 
                to end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. 
                Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us 
                without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! 
                You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and 
                industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops, 
                where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper 
                pay for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the 
                forests where you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without 
                fear, in full assurance that you will find protection! Markets 
                are established in the city where peasants can bring their surplus 
                supplies and the products of the soil. The government has taken 
                the following steps to ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From 
                today, peasants, husbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood 
                of Moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds 
                to two appointed markets, of which one is on the Mokhovaya Street 
                and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such supplies will 
                be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may agree 
                on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be 
                free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder 
                him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week 
                are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient 
                number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays 
                and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the 
                carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their 
                carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey. 
                (5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.</p>
              <p> 　　Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen 
                and artisans, to whatever nation you belong, you are called on 
                to carry out the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor 
                and King and to co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay 
                your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite 
                with us! </p>
              <p> 　　With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of 
                the people, reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. 
                The Emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, 
                and, despite his preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited 
                the theaters that were established by his order.</p>
              <p> 　　In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned 
                heads, Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words 
                Maison de ma Mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, 
                thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence 
                of a monarch. He visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing 
                the orphans saved by him to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed 
                with Tutolmin. Then, as Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered 
                his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian money which he had prepared: 
                &quot;Raising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself 
                and of the French army, he let relief be distributed to those 
                who had been burned out. But as food was too precious to be given 
                to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies, Napoleon preferred 
                to supply them with money with which to purchase food from outside, 
                and had paper rubles distributed to them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With reference to army discipline, orders were continually 
                being issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance 
                of military duties and to suppress robbery. </p>

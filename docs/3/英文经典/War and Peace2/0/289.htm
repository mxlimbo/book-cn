              <p> 　　But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans- 
                which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances- 
                did not affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of 
                a clock detached from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary 
                and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels.</p>
              <p> 　　With reference to the military side- the plan of campaign- 
                that work of genius of which Thiers remarks that, &quot;His genius 
                never devised anything more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,&quot; 
                and enters into a polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work 
                of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth 
                of October- that plan never was or could be executed, for it was 
                quite out of touch with the facts of the case. The fortifying 
                of the Kremlin, for which la Mosquee (as Napoleon termed the church 
                of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to the ground, 
                proved quite useless. The mining of the Kremlin only helped toward 
                fulfilling Napoleon's wish that it should be blown up when he 
                left Moscow- as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself 
                to be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon 
                was so concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals 
                lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according 
                to Thiers it was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the 
                skill- and apparently the genius- of Murat.</p>
              <p> 　　With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's arguments as to 
                his magnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev 
                (whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), 
                proved useless; Alexander did not receive these envoys and did 
                not reply to their embassage.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed 
                incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of 
                a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use 
                to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under 
                pretext of preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property 
                from being looted.</p>
              <p> 　　With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had 
                so easily been settled by Napoleon's visit to a mosque, no results 
                were achieved. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did 
                try to carry out Napoleon's wish, but one of them was slapped 
                in the face by a French soldier while conducting service, and 
                a French official reported of another that: &quot;The priest whom 
                I found and invited to say Mass cleaned and locked up the church. 
                That night the doors were again broken open, the padlocks smashed, 
                the books mutilated, and other disorders perpetrated.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious 
                workmen and to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious 
                workmen, and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured 
                too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them.</p>
              <p> 　　As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and 
                the troops, these did not meet with success either. The theaters 
                set up in the Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed again 
                at once because the actors and actresses were robbed.</p>
              <p> 　　Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine 
                as well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its 
                value. The French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not 
                only was the paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously 
                distributed to the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value 
                in relation to gold.</p>
              <p> 　　But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the 
                orders given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon's attempt 
                to stop the looting and re-establish discipline.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what the army authorities were reporting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against 
                it. Order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying 
                on trade in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, 
                and they sell stolen goods.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged 
                by soldiers of the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from 
                the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they 
                have left, even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, 
                as I have repeatedly witnessed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and 
                pillaging- October 9.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves 
                in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force- October 
                11.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the 
                strict orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are 
                continually seen returning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard 
                disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday 
                evening, last night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that 
                the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person, who should 
                set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to such a point 
                that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies. 
                Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels 
                and officers, and have abused and beaten them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Grand Marshal of the palace,&quot; wrote the governor, 
                &quot;complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the 
                soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and 
                even under the very windows of the Emperor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot 
                the provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated 
                and perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But 
                it did not go away.</p>
              <p> 　　It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic 
                caused by the capture of transport trains on the Smolensk road, 
                and by the battle of Tarutino. The news of that battle of Tarutino, 
                unexpectedly received by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a 
                desire to punish the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the 
                order for departure which the whole army was demanding.</p>
              <p> 　　Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything 
                they had stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal 
                tresor, but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, 
                he was (Thiers says) horror-struck. And yet with his experience 
                of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, 
                as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching 
                Moscow. He gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers 
                were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing, as those 
                vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the sick, and the 
                wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal 
                which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. 
                To study the skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army 
                from the time it entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like 
                studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. 
                Very often a wounded animal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight 
                at the hunter's gun, runs forward and back again, and hastens 
                its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole army, did 
                the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tarutino frightened 
                the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter's gun, reached 
                him, turned back, and finally- like any wild beast- ran back along 
                the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent 
                was familiar.</p>
              <p> 　　During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us 
                to have been the leader of all these movements- as the figurehead 
                of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel- acted like 
                a child who, holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks 
                he is driving it.</p>

              <p> 　　Kutuzov's order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazan road 
                was issued at night on the first of September.</p>
              <p> 　　The first troops started at once, and during the night they 
                marched slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, 
                those nearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of 
                them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, 
                ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, 
                while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from 
                behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They 
                all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and 
                the boats. Kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to 
                the other side of Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September, 
                only the rear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb, where 
                they had ample room. The main army was on the other side of Moscow 
                or beyond it.</p>
              <p> 　　At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of 
                September, Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny 
                Hill looking at the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth 
                of August to the second of September, that is from the battle 
                of Borodino to the entry of the French into Moscow, during the 
                whole of that agitating, memorable week, there had been the extraordinary 
                autumn weather that always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs 
                low and gives more heat than in spring, when everything shines 
                so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart, 
                when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the 
                aromatic autumn air, when even the nights are warm, and when in 
                those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and delight us continually 
                by falling from the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather 
                still held.</p>
              <p> 　　The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from 
                the Poklonny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her 
                gardens, and her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual 
                life, her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.</p>
              <p> 　　The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, 
                such as he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather 
                envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form 
                of life that has no knowledge of them. This city was evidently 
                living with the full force of its own life. By the indefinite 
                signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a living body from 
                a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklonny Hill perceived the throb 
                of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that 
                great and beautiful body.</p>
              <p> 　　Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; 
                every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance 
                as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon 
                felt it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou 
                la sainte. La voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait 
                temps,&quot;* said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow 
                to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d'Ideville, 
                the interpreter. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy 
                Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was high 
                time.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has 
                lost her honor,&quot; thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at 
                Smolensk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty 
                he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt 
                wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. 
                In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at 
                the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing 
                it agitated and awed him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But could it be otherwise?&quot; he thought. &quot;Here 
                is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what 
                is he thinking? A strange, beautiful, and majestic city; and a 
                strange and majestic moment! In what light must I appear to them!&quot; 
                thought he, thinking of his troops. &quot;Here she is, the reward 
                for all those fainthearted men,&quot; he reflected, glancing at 
                those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming 
                up. &quot;One word from me, one movement of my hand, and that 
                ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is 
                always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous 
                and truly great. But no, it can't be true that I am in Moscow,&quot; 
                he suddenly thought. &quot;Yet here she is lying at my feet, with 
                her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the 
                sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism 
                and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy.... 
                It is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know 
                him.&quot; (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what 
                was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself 
                and Alexander.) &quot;From the height of the Kremlin- yes, there 
                is the Kremlin, yes- I will give them just laws; I will teach 
                them the meaning of true civilization, I will make generations 
                of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the 
                deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have 
                waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I 
                love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms 
                of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize 
                the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. 'Boyars,' 
                I will say to them, 'I do not desire war, I desire the peace and 
                welfare of all my subjects.' However, I know their presence will 
                inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly, 
                impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in 
                Moscow? Yes, there she lies.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Qu'on m'amene les boyars,&quot;* said he to his suite. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Bring the boyars to me.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch 
                the boyars.</p>
              <p> 　　Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing 
                in the same place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation. 
                His speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his 
                imagination. That speech was full of dignity and greatness as 
                Napoleon understood it.</p>
              <p> 　　He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he 
                intended to adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed 
                days for assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian 
                notables and his own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, 
                one who would win the hearts of the people. Having learned that 
                there were many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally 
                decided that he would shower favors on them all. He thought that, 
                as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, 
                so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order 
                finally to touch the hearts of the Russians- and being like all 
                Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference 
                to ma chere, ma tendre, ma pauvre mere* - he decided that he would 
                place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters: 
                &quot;This establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.&quot; 
                Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma Mere,*[2] he concluded. 
                &quot;But am I really in Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, 
                but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing?&quot; 
                he wondered. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;My dear, my tender, my poor mother.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;House of my Mother.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in 
                whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. 
                Those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news 
                that Moscow was empty, that everyone had left it. The faces of 
                those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed. 
                They were not alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned 
                by its inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question 
                how to tell the Emperor- without putting him in the terrible position 
                of appearing ridiculous- that he had been awaiting the boyars 
                so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but 
                no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be 
                scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained 
                that the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, 
                and then told the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He will have to be told, all the same,&quot; said some 
                gentlemen of the suite. &quot;But, gentlemen...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating 
                upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before 
                the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow 
                from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's impossible...&quot; declared the gentlemen 
                of the suite, shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter 
                the implied word- le ridicule...</p>
              <p> 　　At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor's 
                instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been 
                too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a 
                sign with his hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, 
                and the troops, who were already spread out on different sides 
                of Moscow, moved into the city through Tver, Kaluga, and Dorogomilov 
                gates. Faster and faster, vying with one another, they moved at 
                the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the clouds of dust they 
                raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling 
                shouts.</p>
              <p> 　　Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with 
                them as far as the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and, 
                dismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the Kammer-Kollezski 
                rampart, awaiting the deputation. </p>

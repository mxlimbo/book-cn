              <p> 　　The fundamental and essential significance of the European 
                events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the 
                movement of the mass of the European peoples from west to east 
                and afterwards from east to west. The commencement of that movement 
                was the movement from west to east. For the peoples of the west 
                to be able to make their warlike movement to Moscow it was necessary: 
                (1) that they should form themselves into a military group of 
                a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group 
                of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established traditions 
                and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they 
                should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and 
                to them the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have 
                to be committed during that movement.</p>
              <p> 　　And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately 
                large group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, 
                and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with 
                new customs and traditions, and a man was produced who would stand 
                at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility 
                for all that had to be done.</p>
              <p> 　　A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, 
                without a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges- by what seem 
                the strangest chances- from among all the seething French parties, 
                and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent 
                position.</p>
              <p> 　　The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance 
                of his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling 
                and self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head 
                of the army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army 
                sent to Italy, his opponents' reluctance to fight, and his own 
                childish audacity and self-confidence secure him military fame. 
                Innumerable so called chances accompany him everywhere. The disfavor 
                into which he falls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage. 
                His attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he 
                is not received into the Russian service, and the appointment 
                he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During the war in Italy he 
                is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is 
                saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic considerations 
                the Russian armies- just those which might have destroyed his 
                prestige- do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris 
                in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are 
                inevitably wiped out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from 
                this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless 
                and senseless expedition to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies 
                him. Impregnable Malta surrenders without a shot; his most reckless 
                schemes are crowned with success. The enemy's fleet, which subsequently 
                did not let a single boat pass, allows his entire army to elude 
                it. In Africa a whole series of outrages are committed against 
                the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the men who commit these crimes, 
                especially their leader, assure themselves that this is admirable, 
                this is glory- it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and 
                is therefore good.</p>
              <p> 　　This ideal of glory and grandeur- which consists not merely 
                in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself 
                on every crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible 
                supernatural significance- that ideal, destined to guide this 
                man and his associates, had scope for its development in Africa. 
                Whatever he does succeeds. The plague does not touch him. The 
                cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. 
                His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble departure from 
                Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is set down to his credit, 
                and again the enemy's fleet twice lets him slip past. When, intoxicated 
                by the crimes he has committed so successfully, he reaches Paris, 
                the dissolution of the republican government, which a year earlier 
                might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and his 
                presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements 
                can only serve to exalt him- and though he himself has no plan, 
                he is quite ready for his new role.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties 
                snatched at him and demanded his participation.</p>
              <p> 　　He alone- with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in 
                Italy and Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime 
                and frankness in lying- he alone could justify what had to be 
                done.</p>
              <p> 　　He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost 
                apart from his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a 
                plan, and all his mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that 
                aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success.</p>
              <p> 　　He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he 
                wishes to flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall 
                into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined 
                him. But the once proud and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that 
                their part is played out, are even more bewildered than he, and 
                do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and 
                retain their power.</p>
              <p> 　　Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as 
                if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms 
                the characters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance 
                forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; 
                chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm 
                him but confirms his power. Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his 
                hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him- thereby convincing 
                the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right, 
                since he had the might. Chance contrives that though he directs 
                all his efforts to prepare an expedition against England (which 
                would inevitably have ruined him) he never carries out that intention, 
                but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians, who surrender 
                without a battle. Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; 
                and by chance all men, not only the French but all Europe- except 
                England which does not take part in the events about to happen- 
                despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes, now 
                recognize his authority, the title he has given himself, and his 
                ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and reasonable 
                to them all.</p>
              <p> 　　As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, 
                the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 
                1806, 1807, and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the 
                group of people that had formed in France unites into one group 
                with the peoples of Central Europe. The strength of the justification 
                of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the 
                increased size of the group. During the ten-year preparatory period 
                this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe. 
                The discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal 
                to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One after 
                another they hasten to display their insignificance before him. 
                The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek the great man's mercy; 
                the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that this man receives 
                a daughter the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the guardian of 
                all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the aggrandizement 
                of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for 
                the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him 
                who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for 
                what is happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime 
                or petty fraud he commits, which in the mouths of those around 
                him is not at once represented as a great deed. The most suitable 
                fete the Germans can devise for him is a celebration of Jena and 
                Auerstadt. Not only is he great, but so are his ancestors, his 
                brothers, his stepsons, and his brothers-in-law. Everything is 
                done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare 
                him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so too are the 
                forces.</p>
              <p> 　　The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal- Moscow. 
                That city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than 
                the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz 
                to Wagram. But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius 
                which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted 
                series of successes to the predestined goal, an innumerable sequence 
                of inverse chances occur- from the cold in his head at Borodino 
                to the sparks which set Moscow on fire, and the frosts- and instead 
                of genius, stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident.</p>
              <p> 　　The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances 
                are now not for Napoleon but always against him.</p>
              <p> 　　A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with 
                a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to 
                east. Attempted drives from east to west- similar to the contrary 
                movements of 1805, 1807, and 1809- precede the great westward 
                movement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous 
                dimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe 
                to the movement; the same hesitation midway, and the same increasing 
                rapidity as the goal is approached.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government 
                and army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; 
                all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable 
                chance occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as 
                the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, 
                his crimes and his craft exposed, he should have appeared to them 
                what he appeared ten years previously and one year later- an outlawed 
                brigand. But by some strange chance no one perceives this. His 
                part is not yet ended. The man who ten years before and a year 
                later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island 
                two days' sail from France, which for some reason is presented 
                to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and millions 
                of money are paid him. </p>

              <p> 　　The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops 
                from the trees. Denisov, the esaul, and Petya rode silently, following 
                the peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned 
                toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and 
                wet leaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest.</p>
              <p> 　　He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced 
                to where the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large 
                oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned 
                mysteriously to them with his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov and Petya rode up to him. From the spot where the 
                peasant was standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond 
                the forest, on a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To 
                the right, beyond a steep ravine, was a small village and a landowner's 
                house with a broken roof. In the village, in the house, in the 
                garden, by the well, by the pond, over all the rising ground, 
                and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village, 
                not more than five hundred yards away, crowds of men could be 
                seen through the shimmering mist. Their un-Russian shouting at 
                their horses which were straining uphill with the carts, and their 
                calls to one another, could be clearly heard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bwing the prisoner here,&quot; said Denisov in a low 
                voice, not taking his eyes off the French.</p>
              <p> 　　A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to 
                Denisov. Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what 
                these and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands 
                into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denisov in 
                affright, but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew 
                gave confused answers, merely assenting to everything Denisov 
                asked him. Denisov turned away from him frowning and addressed 
                the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer 
                boy, now at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in 
                the village and along the road, trying not to miss anything of 
                importance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?&quot; 
                said Denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is a very suitable spot,&quot; said the esaul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll send the infantwy down by the swamps,&quot; Denisov 
                continued. &quot;They'll cweep up to the garden; you'll wide up 
                fwom there with the Cossacks&quot;- he pointed to a spot in the 
                forest beyond the village- &quot;and I with my hussars fwom here. 
                And at the signal shot...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The hollow is impassable- there's a swamp there,&quot; 
                said the esaul. &quot;The horses would sink. We must ride round 
                more to the left....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot 
                sounded from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke 
                appeared, then another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly 
                merry French voices shouting together came up from the slope. 
                For a moment Denisov and the esaul drew back. They were so near 
                that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting. 
                But the firing and shouting did not relate to them. Down below, 
                a man wearing something red was running through the marsh. The 
                French were evidently firing and shouting at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, that's our Tikhon,&quot; said the esaul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it is! It is!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The wascal!&quot; said Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He'll get away!&quot; said the esaul, screwing up his 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　The man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the stream, 
                plunged in so that the water splashed in the air, and, having 
                disappeared for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black 
                with the wet, and ran on. The French who had been pursuing him 
                stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Smart, that!&quot; said the esaul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a beast!&quot; said Denisov with his former look 
                of vexation. &quot;What has he been doing all this time?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's our plastun. I sent him to capture a 'tongue.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Petya, nodding at the first words 
                Denisov uttered as if he understood it all, though he really did 
                not understand anything of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in 
                their band. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near the river Gzhat. 
                When Denisov had come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations 
                and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what 
                he knew about the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, 
                had replied, as all village elders did, that he had neither seen 
                nor heard anything of them. But when Denisov explained that his 
                purpose was to kill the French, and asked if no French had strayed 
                that way, the elder replied that some &quot;more-orderers&quot; 
                had really been at their village, but that Tikhon Shcherbaty was 
                the only man who dealt with such matters. Denisov had Tikhon called 
                and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words in 
                the elder's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country 
                and the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should 
                cherish.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We don't do the French any harm,&quot; said Tikhon, 
                evidently frightened by Denisov's words. &quot;We only fooled 
                about with the lads for fun, you know! We killed a score or so 
                of 'more-orderers,' but we did no harm else...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Next day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having quite forgotten 
                about this peasant, it was reported to him that Tikhon had attached 
                himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with 
                it. Denisov gave orders to let him do so.</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching 
                water, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking 
                and aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for 
                booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons, and 
                when told to would bring in French captives also. Denisov then 
                relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when 
                he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks.</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never 
                lagging behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which 
                he carried rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he 
                used as a wolf uses its teeth, with equal case picking fleas out 
                of its fur or crunching thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy 
                would split logs with blows at arm's length, or holding the head 
                of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons. In Denisov's 
                party he held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything 
                particularly difficult or nasty had to be done- to push a cart 
                out of the mud with one's shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp 
                by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk more 
                than thirty miles in a day- everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It won't hurt that devil- he's as strong as a horse!&quot; 
                they said of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol 
                at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound 
                (which Tikhon treated only with internal and external applications 
                of vodka) was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole 
                detachment- jokes in which Tikhon readily joined.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?&quot; the 
                Cossacks would banter him. And Tikhon, purposely writhing and 
                making faces, pretended to be angry and swore at the French with 
                the funniest curses. The only effect of this incident on Tikhon 
                was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one 
                found more opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed 
                more Frenchmen, and consequently he was made the buffoon of all 
                the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role. Now 
                he had been sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture 
                a &quot;tongue.&quot; But whether because he had not been content 
                to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the 
                night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French 
                and, as Denisov had witnessed from above, had been detected by 
                them. </p>

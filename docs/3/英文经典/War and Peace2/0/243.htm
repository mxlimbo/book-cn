              <p> 　　Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased 
                the countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at 
                a spirit dealer's in Myasnitski Street. When returning by that 
                street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd 
                rioting in front of the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home 
                by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were 
                breaking open the barrels at the drink store, having received 
                orders to do so.</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with enthusiastic 
                haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. 
                The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the 
                yard to the house and back again, shouting confused instructions 
                to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more. Petya directed 
                things in the yard. Sonya, owing to the count's contradictory 
                orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The servants 
                ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing. 
                Natasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly 
                set to work too. At first her intervention in the business of 
                packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank 
                from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and 
                passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because 
                they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe 
                her. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established 
                her authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable 
                Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha 
                set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one 
                almost full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was 
                also much china standing on the tables, and still more was being 
                brought in from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants 
                had gone to fetch it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, wait a bit- we'll pack everything into these,&quot; 
                said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can't, Miss, we have tried to,&quot; said the butler's 
                assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, wait a minute, please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and 
                plates wrapped in paper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The dishes must go in here among the carpets,&quot; 
                said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into 
                three cases,&quot; said the butler's assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, wait, please!&quot; And Natasha began rapidly and 
                deftly sorting out the things. &quot;These aren't needed,&quot; 
                said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev ware. &quot;These- 
                yes, these must go among the carpets,&quot; she said, referring 
                to the Saxony china dishes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't, Natasha! Leave it alone! We'll get it all packed,&quot; 
                urged Sonya reproachfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a young lady she is!&quot; remarked the major-domo.</p>
              <p> 　　But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and 
                began quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets 
                and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything 
                had been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and 
                it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had 
                nearly all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go 
                into the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the carpets 
                would not shut down. A few more things might have been taken out, 
                but Natasha insisted on having her own way. She packed, repacked, 
                pressed, made the butler's assistant and Petya- whom she had drawn 
                into the business of packing- press on the lid, and made desperate 
                efforts herself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's enough, Natasha,&quot; said Sonya. &quot;I see 
                you were right, but just take out the top one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I won't!&quot; cried Natasha, with one hand bolding 
                back the hair that hung over her perspiring face, while with the 
                other she pressed down the carpets. &quot;Now press, Petya! Press, 
                Vasilich, press hard!&quot; she cried.</p>
              <p> 　　The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping 
                her hands, screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. 
                But this only lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh 
                and they now trusted her completely. The count was not angry even 
                when they told him that Natasha had countermanded an order of 
                his, and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was 
                sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up. Thanks 
                to Natasha's directions the work now went on expeditiously, unnecessary 
                things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as 
                possible.</p>
              <p> 　　But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they 
                could not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep 
                and the count, having put off their departure till next morning, 
                went to bed.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.</p>
              <p> 　　That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, 
                and Mavra Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought 
                into the Rostovs' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was 
                a very important man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with 
                a raised hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside 
                the driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers 
                followed the carriage in a cart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please come in here. The masters are going away and 
                the whole house will be empty,&quot; said the old woman to the 
                old attendant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, perhaps,&quot; said he with a sigh. &quot;We don't 
                expect to get him home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, 
                but it's a long way from here, and there's nobody living in it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything 
                in the master's house. Come in,&quot; said Mavra Kuzminichna. 
                &quot;Is he very ill?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　The attendant made a hopeless gesture.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We don't expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the 
                cart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right!&quot; said the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook 
                his head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, 
                and stopped beside Mavra Kuzminichna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O, Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; she murmured.</p>
              <p> 　　She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The masters won't object...&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they 
                took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame 
                Schoss'.</p>
              <p> 　　This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski. </p>

              <p> 　　The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that 
                Moscow was burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went 
                out to look. Sonya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, 
                went out with him. Only Natasha and the countess remained in the 
                room. Petya was no longer with the family, he had gone on with 
                his regiment which was making for Troitsa.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to 
                cry. Natasha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench 
                under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid 
                no attention to her father's words. She was listening to the ceaseless 
                moaning of the adjutant, three houses off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how terrible,&quot; said Sonya returning from the 
                yard chilled and frightened. &quot;I believe the whole of Moscow 
                will burn, there's an awful glow! Natasha, do look! You can see 
                it from the window,&quot; she said to her cousin, evidently wishing 
                to distract her mind.</p>
              <p> 　　But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was 
                said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. 
                She had been in this condition of stupor since the morning, when 
                Sonya, to the surprise and annoyance of the countess, had for 
                some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Natasha of 
                Prince Andrew's wound and of his being with their party. The countess 
                had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with Sonya. Sonya 
                had cried and begged to be forgiven and now, as if trying to atone 
                for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!&quot; said 
                she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's burning?&quot; asked Natasha. &quot;Oh, yes, 
                Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, 
                she turned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that 
                it was evident that she could not see anything, and again settled 
                down in her former attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you didn't see it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, really I did,&quot; Natasha replied in a voice 
                that pleaded to be left in peace.</p>
              <p> 　　Both the countess and Sonya understood that, naturally, neither 
                Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem 
                of importance to Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The 
                countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the 
                back of her hand as she was wont to do when Natasha was ill, then 
                touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was 
                feverish, and finally kissed her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are cold. You are trembling all over. You'd better 
                lie down,&quot; said the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lie down? All right, I will. I'll lie down at once,&quot; 
                said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew 
                was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she 
                had at first asked many questions: Where was he going? How was 
                he wounded? Was it serious? And could she see him? But after she 
                had been told that she could not see him, that he was seriously 
                wounded but that his life was not in danger, she ceased to ask 
                questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving what they 
                told her, and convinced that say what she might she would still 
                be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner 
                of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which 
                the countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat 
                in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. 
                She was planning something and either deciding or had already 
                decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but what 
                it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame 
                Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,&quot; 
                Natasha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened 
                it. Through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be 
                heard more distinctly. She put her head out into the damp night 
                air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and 
                throbbing against the window frame. Natasha knew it was not Prince 
                Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same 
                yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; 
                but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess 
                exchanged a look with Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,&quot; said the 
                countess, softly touching Natasha's shoulders. &quot;Come, lie 
                down.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes... I'll lie down at once,&quot; said Natasha, 
                and began hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.</p>
              <p> 　　When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, 
                she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been 
                made up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of 
                hair to the front, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced 
                fingers rapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her 
                head moved from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly 
                wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilet for the night 
                was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay 
                on the side nearest the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, you'd better lie in the middle,&quot; said 
                Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll stay here,&quot; muttered Natasha. &quot;Do lie 
                down,&quot; she added crossly, and buried her face in the pillow.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed hastily and 
                lay down. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light 
                left in the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire 
                at Little Mytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night 
                came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov's Cossacks 
                had set up across the street, and the adjutant's unceasing moans 
                could still be heard.</p>
              <p> 　　For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds 
                that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not 
                move. First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking 
                of her bed under her, then Madame Schoss' familiar whistling snore 
                and Sonya's gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. 
                Natasha did not answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think she's asleep, Mamma,&quot; said Sonya softly.</p>
              <p> 　　After short silence the countess spoke again but this time 
                no one replied.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after that Natasha heard her mother's even breathing. 
                Natasha did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out 
                from under the quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.</p>
              <p> 　　As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped 
                in a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied 
                near by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning 
                of the adjutant was heard. Natasha sat up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?&quot; she whispered.</p>
              <p> 　　No one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, crossed 
                herself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with 
                her slim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. 
                Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a 
                kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically 
                against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking 
                with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.</p>
              <p> 　　She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto 
                the cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt 
                refreshed her. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, 
                stepped over him, and opened the door into the part of the hut 
                where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest 
                corner, on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying, 
                stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.</p>
              <p> 　　From the moment she had been told that of Prince Andrew's 
                wound and his presence there, Natasha had resolved to see him. 
                She did not know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be 
                painful, but felt the more convinced that it was necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. 
                But now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of 
                what she might see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was 
                he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant's? Yes, he was 
                altogether like that. In her imagination he was that terrible 
                moaning personified. When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner, 
                and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders, 
                she imagined a horrible body there, and stood still in terror. 
                But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She cautiously took 
                one step and then another, and found herself in the middle of 
                a small room containing baggage. Another man- Timokhin- was lying 
                in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others- 
                the doctor and a valet- lay on the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake 
                by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this 
                strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, 
                and nightcap. The valet's sleepy, frightened exclamation, &quot;What 
                do you want? What's the matter?&quot; made Natasha approach more 
                swiftly to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man 
                as that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, the 
                snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly 
                with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always seen 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, 
                his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially 
                his neck, delicate as a child's, revealed by the turn-down collar 
                of his shirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, 
                such as she had never seen on him before. She went up to him and 
                with a swift, flexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.</p>
              <p> 　　He smiled and held out his hand to her. </p>

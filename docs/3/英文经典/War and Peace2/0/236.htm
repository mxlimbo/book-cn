              <p> 　　Helene understood that the question was very simple and easy 
                from the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors 
                were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as 
                to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities.</p>
              <p> 　　So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion 
                of society. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and 
                told him what she had told her other suitor; that is, she put 
                the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over 
                her was to marry her. The elderly magnate was at first as much 
                taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose 
                husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but Helene's imperturbable 
                conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden 
                had its effect on him too. Had Helene herself shown the least 
                sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would certainly 
                have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy 
                or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naivete she told 
                her intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both 
                the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved 
                both and was afraid of grieving either.</p>
              <p> 　　A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Helene 
                wanted to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread 
                many would have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that 
                the unfortunate and interesting Helene was in doubt which of the 
                two men she should marry. The question was no longer whether this 
                was possible, but only which was the better match and how the 
                matter would be regarded at court. There were, it is true, some 
                rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question, 
                who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, 
                but there were not many such and they remained silent, while the 
                majority were interested in Helene's good fortune and in the question 
                which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was right 
                or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not 
                discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people 
                &quot;wiser than you or me,&quot; as they said, and to doubt the 
                correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one's stupidity 
                and incapacity to live in society.</p>
              <p> 　　Only Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, had come to Petersburg 
                that summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to 
                express an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Helene 
                at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid 
                general silence, said in her gruff voice: &quot;So wives of living 
                men have started marrying again! Perhaps you think you have invented 
                a novelty? You have been forestalled, my dear! It was thought 
                of long ago. It is done in all the brothels,&quot; and with these 
                words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her wide sleeves with her usual 
                threatening gesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded 
                in Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only 
                noticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had 
                used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili, who of late very often forgot what he had said 
                and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked 
                to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Helene, I have a word to say to you,&quot; and he would 
                lead her aside, drawing her hand downward. &quot;I have heard 
                of certain projects concerning... you know. Well my dear child, 
                you know how your father's heart rejoices to know that you... 
                You have suffered so much.... But, my dear child, consult only 
                your own heart. That is all I have to say,&quot; and concealing 
                his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter's 
                and move away.</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly 
                clever man, and who was one of one of the disinterested friends 
                so brilliant a woman as Helene always has- men friends who can 
                never change into lovers- once gave her his view of the matter 
                at a small and intimate gathering.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Listen, Bilibin,&quot; said Helene (she always called 
                friends of that sort by their surnames), and she touched his coat 
                sleeve with her white, beringed fingers. &quot;Tell me, as you 
                would a sister, what I ought to do. Which of the two?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, 
                with a smile on his lips.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are not taking me unawares, you know,&quot; said 
                he. &quot;As a true friend, I have thought and thought again about 
                your affair. You see, if you marry the prince&quot;- he meant 
                the younger man- and he crooked one finger, &quot;you forever 
                lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will displease 
                the court besides. (You know there is some kind of connection.) 
                But if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy, 
                and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making 
                a mesalliance by marrying you,&quot; and Bilibin smoothed out 
                his forehead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a true friend!&quot; said Helene beaming, and 
                again touching Bilibin's sleeve. &quot;But I love them, you know, 
                and don't want to distress either of them. I would give my life 
                for the happiness of them both.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not 
                even he could help in that difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Une maitresse-femme!* That's what is called putting 
                things squarely. She would like to be married to all three at 
                the same time,&quot; thought he. </p>
              <p> 　　*A masterly woman. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?&quot; 
                Bilibin asked, his reputation being so well established that he 
                did not fear to ask so naive a question. &quot;Will he agree?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, he loves me so!&quot; said Helene, who for some 
                reason imagined that Pierre too loved her. &quot;He will do anything 
                for me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Even divorce you?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the 
                proposed marriage was Helene's mother, Princess Kuragina. She 
                was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now 
                that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart, she could 
                not reconcile herself to the idea. She consulted a Russian priest 
                as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a husband's 
                lifetime, and the priest told her that it was impossible, and 
                to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel which (as it seemed 
                to him) plainly remarriage while the husband is alive.</p>
              <p> 　　Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, 
                she drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her 
                alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Having listened to her mother's objections, Helene smiled 
                blandly and ironically.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry her that 
                is divorced...'&quot; said the old princess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez 
                rein. Dans ma position j'ai des devoirs,&quot;* said Helene changing 
                from Russian, in which language she always felt that her case 
                did not sound quite clear, into French which suited it better. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Oh, Mamma, don't talk nonsense! You don't understand 
                anything. In my position I have obligations. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, my dear....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't understand that the Holy 
                Father, who has the right to grant dispensations...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Just then the lady companion who lived with Helene came in 
                to announce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to 
                see her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis 
                furieuse contre lui, parce qu'il m' a manque parole.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;No, tell him I don't wish to see him, I am furious 
                with him for not keeping his word to me.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Comtesse, a tout peche misericorde,&quot;* said a fair-haired 
                young man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Countess, there is mercy for every sin.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young 
                man who had entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded 
                to her daughter and sidled out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, she is right,&quot; thought the old princess, all 
                her convictions dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. 
                &quot;She is right, but how is it that we in our irrecoverable 
                youth did not know it? Yet it is so simple,&quot; she thought 
                as she got into her carriage. </p>
              <p> 　　By the beginning of August Helene's affairs were clearly defined 
                and she wrote a letter to her husband- who, as she imagined, loved 
                her very much- informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and 
                of her having embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry 
                out all the formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be 
                explained to him by the bearer of the letter. </p>
              <p> 　　And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and 
                powerful keeping- Your friend Helene. </p>
              <p> 　　This letter was brought to Pierre's house when he was on the 
                field of Borodino.</p>

              <p> 　　In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being 
                carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, 
                between the parties of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fedorovna, 
                the Tsarevich, and others, drowned as usual by the buzzing of 
                the court drones. But the calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, 
                concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life, went 
                on in its old way and made it hard, except by a great effort, 
                to realize the danger and the difficult position of the Russian 
                people. There were the same receptions and balls, the same French 
                theater, the same court interests and service interests and intrigues 
                as usual. Only in the very highest circles were attempts made 
                to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position. Stories 
                were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved in 
                these difficult circumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned for 
                the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under 
                her patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed 
                to Kazan, and the things belonging to these institutions had already 
                been packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what 
                instructions she would be pleased to give- with her characteristic 
                Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions 
                about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign, 
                but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last 
                to quit Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　At Anna Pavlovna's on the twenty-sixth of August, the very 
                day of the battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the chief feature 
                of which was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the 
                Bishop when sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. 
                It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. 
                Prince Vasili himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. 
                (He used to read at the Empress'.) The art of his reading was 
                supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite independently 
                of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating between 
                a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite 
                at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading, 
                as was always the case at Anna Pavlovna's soirees, had a political 
                significance. That evening she expected several important personages 
                who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater 
                and aroused to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already 
                arrived, but Anna Pavlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she 
                wanted in her drawing room, did not let the reading begin but 
                wound up the springs of a general conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess 
                Bezukhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, 
                had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament, 
                and was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated 
                Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself 
                to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual 
                way.</p>
              <p> 　　They all knew very well that the enchanting countess' illness 
                arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands 
                at the same time, and that the Italian's cure consisted in removing 
                such inconvenience; but in Anna Pavlovna's presence no one dared 
                to think of this or even appear to know it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says 
                it is angina pectoris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the 
                angina...&quot; and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child 
                when the doctor told him the case was dangerous.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting 
                woman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are speaking of the poor countess?&quot; said Anna 
                Pavlovna, coming up just then. &quot;I sent to ask for news, and 
                hear that she is a little better. Oh, she is certainly the most 
                charming woman in the world,&quot; she went on, with a smile at 
                her own enthusiasm. &quot;We belong to different camps, but that 
                does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She is very 
                unfortunate!&quot; added Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting 
                the veil from the secret of the countess' malady, an unwary young 
                man ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not 
                been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan 
                who might employ dangerous remedies.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your information maybe better than mine,&quot; Anna 
                Pavlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced 
                young man, &quot;but I know on good authority that this doctor 
                is a very learned and able man. He is private physician to the 
                Queen of Spain.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pavlovna turned 
                to another group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians: 
                having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth 
                it out again and utter one of his mots.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think it is delightful,&quot; he said, referring to 
                a diplomatic note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian 
                banners captured from the French by Wittgenstein, &quot;the hero 
                of Petropol&quot; as he was then called in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What's that?&quot; asked Anna Pavlovna, securing 
                silence for the mot, which she had heard before.</p>
              <p> 　　And Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, 
                which he had himself composed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,&quot; said 
                Bilibin, &quot;friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong 
                path,&quot; and his brow became smooth again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Charming, charming!&quot; observed Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The path to Warsaw, perhaps,&quot; Prince Hippolyte 
                remarked loudly and unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding 
                what he meant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused 
                surprise. He knew no more than the others what his words meant. 
                During his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that 
                such utterances were received as very witty, and at every opportunity 
                he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head. 
                &quot;It may turn out very well,&quot; he thought, &quot;but if 
                not, they'll know how to arrange matters.&quot; And really, during 
                the awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic 
                person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been waiting for and wished 
                to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, 
                invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing him two candles 
                and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone became silent. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor! &quot; Prince Vasili 
                sternly declaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire 
                whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary. But no one 
                said anything. &quot;Moscow, our ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, 
                receives her Christ&quot;- he placed a sudden emphasis on the 
                word her- &quot;as a mother receives her zealous sons into her 
                arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant 
                glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, 'Hosanna, blessed is he 
                that cometh!'&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin attentively examined his nails, and many of those 
                present appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to 
                blame. Anna Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance, like 
                an old woman muttering the prayer at Communion: &quot;Let the 
                bold and insolent Goliath...&quot; she whispered.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili continued. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of 
                France encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; 
                humble Faith, the sling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite 
                his head in his blood-thirsty pride. This icon of the Venerable 
                Sergius, the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our 
                country's weal, is offered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve 
                that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your 
                most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that 
                the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully fulfill 
                the desires of Your Majesty.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What force! What a style!&quot; was uttered in approval 
                both of reader and of author.</p>
              <p> 　　Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna's guests talked for 
                a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various 
                conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few 
                days.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will see,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna, &quot;that tomorrow, 
                on the Emperor's birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable 
                presentiment!&quot; </p>

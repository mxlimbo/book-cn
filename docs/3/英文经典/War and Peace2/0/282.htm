              <p> 　　The Russian army was commanded by Kutuzov and his staff, and 
                also by the Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment 
                of Moscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of 
                the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for his 
                guidance. Though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition 
                that Moscow was still in our hands, it was approved by the staff 
                and accepted as a basis for action. Kutuzov only replied that 
                movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute. 
                So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties 
                that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who were to 
                watch Kutuzov's actions and report upon them.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now 
                reorganized. The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been 
                killed, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be 
                filled. Very serious consideration was given to the question whether 
                it would be better to put A in B's place and B in D's, or on the 
                contrary to put D in A's place, and so on- as if anything more 
                than A's or B's satisfaction depended on this.</p>
              <p> 　　As a result of the hostility between Kutuzov and Bennigsen, 
                his Chief of Staff, the presence of confidential representatives 
                of the Emperor, and these transfers, a more than usually complicated 
                play of parties was going on among the staff of the army. A was 
                undermining B, D was undermining C, and so on in all possible 
                combinations and permutations. In all these plottings the subject 
                of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war, which all these 
                men believed they were directing; but this affair of the war went 
                on independently of them, as it had to go: that is, never in the 
                way people devised, but flowing always from the essential attitude 
                of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did all these schemes, 
                crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of 
                what had to happen. </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second 
                of October in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at 
                Tarutino) Since September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the 
                enemy. Your last reports were written on the twentieth, and during 
                all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy 
                or for the relief of the ancient capital, but according to your 
                last report you have even retreated farther. Serpukhov is already 
                occupied by an enemy detachment and Tula with its famous arsenal 
                so indispensable to the army, is in danger. From General Wintzingerode's 
                reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving 
                on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several thousand men 
                is moving on Dmitrov. A third has advanced along the Vladimir 
                road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed 
                between Ruza and Mozhaysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late 
                as the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the 
                enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments, and with 
                Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy's 
                forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of 
                your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is probably pursuing 
                you with detachments, or at most with an army corps much weaker 
                than the army entrusted to you. It would seem that, availing yourself 
                of these circumstances, you might advantageously attack a weaker 
                one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to retreat, retaining 
                in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by 
                the enemy, and thereby averting danger from Tula and other towns 
                in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able 
                to direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this 
                capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; 
                for with the army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution 
                and energy, you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity. 
                Remember that you have still to answer to our offended country 
                for the loss of Moscow. You have experienced my readiness to reward 
                you. That readiness will not weaken in me, but I and Russia have 
                a right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and success 
                which your intellect, military talent, and the courage of the 
                troops you command justify us in expecting. </p>
              <p> 　　But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation 
                of the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was 
                dispatched, Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain 
                the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.</p>
              <p> 　　On the second of October a Cossack, Shapovalov, who was out 
                scouting, killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded 
                hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left 
                flank of Murat's army, encamped there without any precautions. 
                The Cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen 
                into the hands of the French. A cornet, hearing the story, informed 
                his commander.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers 
                wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, 
                but one of the superior officers, who was acquainted with the 
                higher authorities, reported the incident to a general on the 
                staff.　　The state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly 
                strained. Ermolov had been to see Bennigsen a few days previously 
                and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander 
                in chief to induce him to take the offensive.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I did not know you I should think you did not want 
                what you are asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness 
                is sure to do the opposite,&quot; replied Bennigsen.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse patrols who were 
                sent out, was the final proof that events had matured. The tightly 
                coiled spring was released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes 
                to play. Despite all his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, 
                and his knowledge of men, Kutuzov- having taken into consideration 
                the Cossack's report, a note from Bennigsen who sent personal 
                reports to the Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Emperor to 
                hold, and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish- 
                could no longer check the inevitable movement, and gave the order 
                to do what he regarded as useless and harmful- gave his approval, 
                that is, to the accomplished fact. </p>

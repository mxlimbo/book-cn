              <p> 　　Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They 
                kissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and 
                they went out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles 
                whispered to the boy to come downstairs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me 
                stay,&quot; replied Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ma tante, please let me stay,&quot; said he, going up 
                to his aunt.</p>
              <p> 　　His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess 
                Mary glanced at him and turned to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When you are here he can't tear himself away,&quot; 
                she said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. 
                Good night!&quot; said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, 
                and he turned to young Nicholas with a smile. &quot;You and I 
                haven't seen anything of one another yet... How like he is growing, 
                Mary!&quot; he added, addressing Countess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Like my father?&quot; asked the boy, flushing crimson 
                and looking up at Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when 
                the children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; 
                Natasha did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denisov 
                rose, asked for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from 
                Sonya- who sat weary but resolute at the samovar- and questioned 
                Pierre. The curly-headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed 
                in a corner, starting every now and then and muttering something 
                to himself, and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion 
                as he turned his curly head, with his thin neck exposed by his 
                turn-down collar, toward the place where Pierre sat.</p>
              <p> 　　The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those 
                in power, in which most people see the chief interest of home 
                politics. Denisov, dissatisfied with the government on account 
                of his own disappointments in the service, heard with pleasure 
                of the things done in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid, and 
                made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One used to have to be a German- now one must dance 
                with Tatawinova and Madame Kwudener, and wead Ecka'tshausen and 
                the bwethwen. Oh, they should let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose- 
                he'd knock all this nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command 
                of the Semenov wegiment to a fellow like that Schwa'tz!&quot; 
                he cried.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas, though free from Denisov's readiness to find fault 
                with everything, also thought that discussion of the government 
                was a very serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had 
                been appointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That, 
                and that the Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, 
                seemed to him very important. And so he thought it necessary to 
                take an interest in these things and to question Pierre. The questions 
                put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary 
                character of gossip about the higher government circles.</p>
              <p> 　　But Natasha, knowing all her husband's ways and ideas, saw 
                that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the 
                conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt 
                idea for the sake of which he had gone to Petersburg to consult 
                with his new friend Prince Theodore, and she helped him by asking 
                how his affairs with Prince Theodore had gone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What was it about?&quot; asked Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always the same thing,&quot; said Pierre, looking round 
                at his listeners. &quot;Everybody sees that things are going so 
                badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the 
                duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can decent men do?&quot; Nicholas inquired, frowning 
                slightly. &quot;What can be done?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, this...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come into my study,&quot; said Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her 
                baby, now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. 
                Countess Mary followed her. The men went into the study and little 
                Nicholas Bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat 
                down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what would you do?&quot; asked Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always some fantastic schemes,&quot; said Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why this,&quot; began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing 
                the room, sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: 
                &quot;the position in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not 
                look into anything. He has abandoned himself altogether to this 
                mysticism&quot; (Pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone 
                now). &quot;He seeks only for peace, and only these people sans 
                foi ni loi* can give it him- people who recklessly hack at and 
                strangle everything- Magnitski, Arakcheev, and tutti quanti.... 
                You will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself 
                but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the 
                more readily your object might be attained,&quot; he said to Nicholas. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*Without faith or law. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what does that lead up to?&quot; said Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law 
                courts, in the army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military 
                Settlements; the people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. 
                All that is young and honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this 
                cannot go on. Everything is strained to such a degree that it 
                will certainly break,&quot; said Pierre (as those who examine 
                the actions of any government have always said since governments 
                began). &quot;I told them just one thing in Petersburg.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Told whom?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you know whom,&quot; said Pierre, with a meaning 
                glance from under his brows. &quot;Prince Theodore and all those. 
                To encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course. 
                The aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something 
                else is needed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. 
                His face darkened and he went up to the boy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why? Let him be,&quot; said Pierre, taking Nicholas 
                by the arm and continuing. &quot;That is not enough, I told them. 
                Something else is needed. When you stand expecting the overstrained 
                string to snap at any moment, when everyone is expecting the inevitable 
                catastrophe, as many as possible must join hands as closely as 
                they can to withstand the general calamity. Everything that is 
                young and strong is being enticed away and depraved. One is lured 
                by women, another by honors, a third by ambition or money, and 
                they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you or 
                I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let 
                the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action 
                as well!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an 
                armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly 
                and frowning more and more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But action with what aim?&quot; he cried. &quot;And 
                what position will you adopt toward the government?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, the position of assistants. The society need not 
                be secret if the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile 
                to government, but it is a society of true conservatives- a society 
                of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent 
                some Pugachev or other from killing my children and yours, and 
                Arakcheev from sending me off to some Military Settlement. We 
                join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but it's a secret society and therefore a hostile 
                and harmful one which can only cause harm.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe&quot; (they 
                did not then venture to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) 
                &quot;do any harm? The Tugendbund is an alliance of virtue: it 
                is love, mutual help... it is what Christ preached on the Cross.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully 
                at her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her- 
                that did not even interest her, for it seemed to her that was 
                all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time (it 
                seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from Pierre's 
                whole soul), but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance 
                that made her glad.</p>
              <p> 　　The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down 
                collar- whom everyone had forgotten- gazed at Pierre with even 
                greater and more rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre's burned 
                into his heart, and with a nervous movement of his fingers he 
                unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came 
                upon on his uncle's table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what 
                the German Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the 
                sausage eaters, but I don't understand it and can't even pwonounce 
                it,&quot; interposed Denisov in a loud and resolute voice. &quot;I 
                agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund 
                I don't understand. If we're not satisfied, let us have a bunt 
                of our own. That's all wight. Je suis vot'e homme!&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;I'm your man.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre smiled, Natasha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted 
                his brows still more and began proving to Pierre that there was 
                no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke 
                of existed only in his imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, 
                and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful, 
                Nicholas felt himself cornered. This made him still angrier, for 
                he was fully convinced, not by reasoning but by something within 
                him stronger than reason, of the justice of his opinion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will tell you this,&quot; he said, rising and trying 
                with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, 
                but finally abandoning the attempt. &quot;I can't prove it to 
                you. You say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow 
                is coming: I don't see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance 
                is a conditional matter, and to that I reply: 'You are my best 
                friend, as you know, but if you formed a secret society and began 
                working against the government- be it what it may- I know it is 
                my duty to obey the government. And if Arakcheev ordered me to 
                lead a squadron against you and cut you down, I should not hesitate 
                an instant, but should do it.' And you may argue about that as 
                you like!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An awkward silence followed these words. Natasha was the first 
                to speak, defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her 
                defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation 
                was resumed, and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of 
                Nicholas' last remark.</p>
              <p> 　　When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkonski 
                went up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would 
                he agree with you?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, 
                complex, and powerful process of thought and feeling must have 
                been going on in this boy during that conversation, and remembering 
                all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him. 
                He had, however, to give him an answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; he said reluctantly, and left 
                the study.</p>
              <p> 　　The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice 
                what he had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went 
                up to Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,&quot; 
                he said, pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas started angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right,&quot; he said, throwing the bits 
                under the table.</p>
              <p> 　　And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he 
                turned away from the boy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You ought not to have been here at all,&quot; he said.

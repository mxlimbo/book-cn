              <p> 　　The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the 
                forest. A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the 
                snow, lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.</p>
              <p> 　　About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of 
                the forest, and the crackling of dry branches.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A bear, lads,&quot; said one of the men.</p>
              <p> 　　They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest 
                into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures 
                clinging to one another.</p>
              <p> 　　These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. 
                They came up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language 
                our soldiers did not understand. One was taller than the other; 
                he wore an officer's hat and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching 
                the fire he had been going to sit down, but fell. The other, a 
                short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head, was stronger. 
                He raised his companion and said something, pointing to his mouth. 
                The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the 
                ground for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat porridge and 
                vodka for both of them.</p>
              <p> 　　The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with 
                his head wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.</p>
              <p> 　　When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge 
                he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly 
                to the soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused 
                food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, 
                looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally 
                he emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, 
                pointing to his shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the 
                fact that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian 
                officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether 
                he would not take a French officer into his hut to warm him, and 
                when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the 
                officer to be brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He rose 
                and tried to walk, but staggered and would have fallen had not 
                a soldier standing by held him up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You won't do it again, eh?&quot; said one of the soldiers, 
                winking and turning mockingly to Ramballe.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are- a 
                real peasant!&quot; came rebukes from all sides addressed to the 
                jesting soldier.</p>
              <p> 　　They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of 
                two soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms 
                around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are 
                men! Oh, my brave, kind friends,&quot; and he leaned his head 
                against the shoulder of one of the men like a child.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, 
                surrounded by the soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming 
                eyes, was wearing a woman's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion 
                round his head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing 
                a French song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round 
                the nearest soldier. The soldiers simply held their sides as they 
                watched him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I'll soon 
                pick it up. How is it?&quot; said the man- a singer and a wag- 
                whom Morel was embracing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!&quot; sang Morel, 
                winking. &quot;Ce diable a quatre...&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That 
                rowdy devil.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!&quot; repeated 
                the soldier, flourishing his arm and really catching the tune.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!&quot; rose their rough, joyous laughter 
                from all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, go on, go on!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Qui eut le triple talent,</p>
              <p> 　　De boire, de battre,</p>
              <p> 　　Et d'etre un vert galant.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*Who had a triple talent</p>
              <p> 　　 For drinking, for fighting,</p>
              <p> 　　 And for being a gallant old boy... </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletaev!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ke...&quot; Zaletaev, brought out with effort: &quot;ke-e-e-e,&quot; 
                he drawled, laboriously pursing his lips, &quot;le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, 
                e de-tra-va-ga-la &quot; he sang.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want 
                some more to eat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get 
                filled up after starving.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set 
                to work on his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily 
                as they watched him. The older men, who thought it undignified 
                to amuse themselves with such nonsense, continued to lie at the 
                opposite side of the fire, but one would occasionally raise himself 
                on an elbow and glance at Morel with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are men too,&quot; said one of them as he wrapped 
                himself up in his coat. &quot;Even wormwood grows on its own root.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means 
                a hard frost....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one 
                was looking at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: 
                now flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering 
                something gladsome and mysterious to one another.</p>

              <p> 　　The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise 
                as it did, only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by 
                the evening of the second of September.</p>
              <p> 　　After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances, 
                Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely 
                obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when 
                this thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered 
                nothing of the past, understood nothing of the present, and all 
                he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream.</p>
              <p> 　　He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life's 
                demands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition 
                he was unable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich's house, 
                on the plea of sorting the deceased's books and papers, only in 
                search of rest from life's turmoil, for in his mind the memory 
                of Joseph Alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, 
                and calm thoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into 
                which he felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and 
                in Joseph Alexeevich's study he really found it. When he sat with 
                his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness 
                of the study, calm and significant memories of the last few days 
                rose one after another in his imagination, particularly of the 
                battle of Borodino and of that vague sense of his own insignificance 
                and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity, and strength 
                of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When Gerasim 
                roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking 
                part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. 
                And with that object he had asked Gerasim to get him a peasant's 
                coat and a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining 
                in Joseph Alexeevich's house and keeping his name secret. Then 
                during the first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried 
                several times to fix his attention on the Masonic manuscripts, 
                but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously occurred 
                to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection 
                with Bonaparte's more than once vaguely presented itself. But 
                the idea that he, L'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit 
                to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that 
                often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.</p>
              <p> 　　When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking 
                part among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met 
                the Rostovs and Natasha had said to him: &quot;Are you remaining 
                in Moscow?... How splendid!&quot; the thought flashed into his 
                mind that it really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were 
                taken, for him to remain there and do what he was predestined 
                to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not 
                lagging in any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills 
                gate. But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow 
                would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what before had seemed 
                to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary 
                and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, 
                and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either perish or put 
                an end to the misery of all Europe- which it seemed to him was 
                solely due to Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte's 
                life in 1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the 
                student had been shot. And the risk to which he would expose his 
                life by carrying out his design excited him still more.</p>
              <p> 　　Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this 
                purpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice 
                and suffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling 
                that had caused him to go to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and 
                to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused 
                him to run away from his home and, in place of the luxury and 
                comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without 
                undressing and eat the same food as Gerasim. The other was that 
                vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional, 
                artificial, and human- for everything the majority of men regard 
                as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had first experienced 
                this strange and fascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace, when 
                he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life- all that men 
                so painstakingly acquire and guard- if it has any worth has so 
                only by reason the joy with which it can all be renounced.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend 
                his last penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or 
                glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him 
                all the money he possesses: the feeling which causes a man to 
                perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane, 
                to test, as it were, his personal power and strength, affirming 
                the existence of a higher, nonhuman criterion of life.</p>
              <p> 　　From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for 
                the first time at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously 
                under its influence, but only now found full satisfaction for 
                it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was supported in his design 
                and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in 
                that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like everyone else, 
                his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement 
                to the Rostovs that he would remain in Moscow would all become 
                not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to 
                this Pierre was very sensitive.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded 
                to his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he 
                drank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty 
                unchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short 
                sofa without bedding- all this kept him in a state of excitement 
                bordering on insanity.</p>
              <p> 　　It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The French had already 
                entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only 
                thought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details 
                in his mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself 
                either the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but 
                with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined 
                his own destruction and heroic endurance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!&quot; 
                he thought. &quot;Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... 
                with pistol or dagger? But that is all the same! 'It is not I 
                but the hand of Providence that punishes thee,' I shall say,&quot; 
                thought he, imagining what he would say when killing Napoleon. 
                &quot;Well then, take me and execute me!&quot; he went on, speaking 
                to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.</p>
              <p> 　　While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking 
                to himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold 
                appeared the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before 
                but now quite transformed.</p>
              <p> 　　His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. 
                He was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, 
                but noticing embarrassment on Pierre's face immediately grew bold 
                and, staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of 
                the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They're frightened,&quot; he said confidentially in 
                a hoarse voice. &quot;I say I won't surrender, I say... Am I not 
                right, sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table 
                seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, 
                stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from 
                him. Pierre, coming out into the corridor, looked with pity and 
                repulsion at the half-crazy old man. Makar Alexeevich, frowning 
                with exertion, held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently 
                with some heroic fancy in his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To arms! Board them! No, you shan't get it,&quot; he 
                yelled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness- 
                please, sir, to let go! Please, sir...&quot; pleaded Gerasim, 
                trying carefully to steer Makar Alexeevich by the elbows back 
                to the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you? Bonaparte!...&quot; shouted Makar Alexeevich.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and 
                rest. Allow me to have the pistol.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?&quot; 
                shouted Makar Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol. &quot;Board 
                them!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Catch hold!&quot; whispered Gerasim to the porter.</p>
              <p> 　　They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to 
                the door.</p>
              <p> 　　The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle 
                and of a tipsy, hoarse voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated 
                from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!&quot; 
                she cried.</p>
              <p> 　　Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go, and in the 
                now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the 
                front door could be heard. </p>

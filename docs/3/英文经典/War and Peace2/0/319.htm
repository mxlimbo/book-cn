              <p> 　　Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was 
                feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family. 
                All of them- her father, mother, and Sonya- were so near to her, 
                so familiar, so commonplace, that all their words and feelings 
                seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of 
                late, and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded 
                them with hostility. She heard Dunyasha's words about Peter Ilynich 
                and a misfortune, but did not grasp them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? 
                They just live their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,&quot; 
                thought Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming 
                out of her mother's room. His face was puckered up and wet with 
                tears. He had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the 
                sobs that were choking him. When he saw Natasha he waved his arms 
                despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted 
                his soft round face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pe... Petya... Go, go, she... is calling...&quot; and 
                weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs 
                to a chair, he almost fell into it, covering his face with his 
                hands.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natasha's 
                whole being. Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful 
                ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying. 
                But the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release 
                from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part 
                in life. The sight of her father, the terribly wild cries of her 
                mother that she heard through the door, made her immediately forget 
                herself and her own grief.</p>
              <p> 　　She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing 
                to her mother's door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, 
                came out from that room and taking Natasha by the arm said something 
                to her. Natasha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid 
                steps, pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with 
                herself, and then ran to her mother.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward 
                position, stretching out and beating her head against the wall. 
                Sonya and the maids were holding her arms.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha! Natasha!...&quot; cried the countess. &quot;It's 
                not true... it's not true... He's lying... Natasha!&quot; she 
                shrieked, pushing those around her away. &quot;Go away, all of 
                you; it's not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!... It's not true!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, 
                embraced her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned 
                her face toward herself, and clung to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,&quot; 
                she kept on whispering, not pausing an instant.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with 
                her, demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore 
                open her mother's dress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...&quot; she 
                whispered incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, 
                and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling 
                her nose and cheeks.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess pressed her daughter's hand, closed her eyes, 
                and became quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed 
                swiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natasha began 
                to press her daughter's head with all her strength. Then she turned 
                toward her daughter's face which was wincing with pain and gazed 
                long at it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, you love me?&quot; she said in a soft trustful 
                whisper. &quot;Natasha, you would not deceive me? You'll tell 
                me the whole truth?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look 
                there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My darling Mummy!&quot; she repeated, straining all 
                the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the 
                excess of grief that crushed her mother.</p>
              <p> 　　And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing 
                to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed 
                in the bloom of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, 
                nor the next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave 
                her mother. Her persevering and patient love seemed completely 
                to surround the countess every moment, not explaining or consoling, 
                but recalling her to life.</p>
              <p> 　　During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a 
                few minutes, and Natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair 
                and closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead 
                creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won't you 
                have some tea?&quot; Natasha went up to her. &quot;You have improved 
                in looks and grown more manly,&quot; continued the countess, taking 
                her daughter's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma! What are you saying...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, he is no more, no more!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for 
                the first time. </p>

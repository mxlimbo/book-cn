              <p> 　　Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were 
                confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where 
                he remained for four weeks.</p>
              <p> 　　When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty 
                figures to him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in 
                his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification 
                of everything Russian, kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his 
                neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him, as 
                of something round, was fully confirmed: Platon's whole figure- 
                in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, and 
                bast shoes- was round. His head was quite round, his back, chest, 
                shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever ready to 
                embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, 
                gentle brown eyes were also round.</p>
              <p> 　　Platon Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories 
                of campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did 
                not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. 
                But his brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken 
                semicircles when he laughed- as he often did- were all sound and 
                good, there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and 
                his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially 
                of firmness and endurance.</p>
              <p> 　　His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression 
                of innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But 
                the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. 
                It was evident that he never considered what he had said or was 
                going to say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his 
                intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　His physical strength and agility during the first days of 
                his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue 
                and sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: &quot;Lord, 
                lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!&quot; and every 
                morning on getting up, he said: &quot;I lay down and curled up, 
                I get up and shake myself.&quot; And indeed he only had to lie 
                down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he only had to shake himself, 
                to be ready without a moment's delay for some work, just as children 
                are ready to play directly they awake. He could do everything, 
                not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, 
                and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed 
                himself conversation- of which he was fond- and songs. He did 
                not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but 
                like the birds, evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same 
                way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, 
                and the sounds were always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and 
                almost feminine, and his face at such times was very serious.</p>
              <p> 　　Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, 
                he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him- 
                everything military and alien to himself- and had returned to 
                his former peasant habits.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A soldier on leave- a shirt outside breeches,&quot; 
                he would say.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though 
                he did not complain, and often mentioned that he had not been 
                flogged once during the whole of his army service. When he related 
                anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory 
                of his &quot;Christian&quot; life, as he called his peasant existence. 
                The proverbs, of which his talk was full, were for the most part 
                not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk 
                sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant, but 
                when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound 
                wisdom.</p>
              <p> 　　He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said 
                on a previous occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk 
                and he talked well, adorning his speech with terms of endearment 
                and with folk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself, 
                but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest 
                events- sometimes just such as Pierre had witnessed without taking 
                notice of them- assumed in Karataev's a character of solemn fitness. 
                He liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell 
                of an evening (they were always the same), but most of all he 
                liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile joyfully when 
                listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word or asking 
                a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear 
                to himself. Karataev had no attachments, friendships, or love, 
                as Pierre understood them, but loved and lived affectionately 
                with everything life brought him in contact with, particularly 
                with man- not any particular man, but those with whom he happened 
                to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the French, and Pierre 
                who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite of Karataev's 
                affectionate tenderness for him (by which he unconsciously gave 
                Pierre's spiritual life its due) he would not have grieved for 
                a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in the 
                same way toward Karataev.</p>
              <p> 　　To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary 
                soldier. They called him &quot;little falcon&quot; or &quot;Platosha,&quot; 
                chaffed him good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre 
                he always remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, 
                rounded, eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and 
                truth.</p>
              <p> 　　Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. 
                When he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would 
                ask him to repeat them, but Platon could never recall what he 
                had said a moment before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre 
                the words of his favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart 
                is sick occurred in it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning 
                could be got out of it. He did not, and could not, understand 
                the meaning of words apart from their context. Every word and 
                action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to 
                him, which was his life. But his life, as he regarded it, had 
                no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as part of 
                a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions 
                flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance 
                exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance 
                of any word or deed taken separately.</p>

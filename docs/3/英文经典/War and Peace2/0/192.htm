              <p> 　　The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess 
                Mary to come to his study.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well? Are you satisfied now?&quot; said he. &quot;You've 
                made me quarrel with my son! Satisfied, are you? That's all you 
                wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts me, it hurts. I'm old and weak 
                and this is what you wanted. Well then, gloat over it! Gloat over 
                it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole 
                week. He was ill and did not leave his study.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness 
                the old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not 
                admit Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone attended him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his 
                former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to 
                building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely 
                breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks 
                and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: &quot;There, you 
                see? You plotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my 
                relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, 
                but you see I need neither her nor you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, 
                watching his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, 
                and talking to Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her 
                books, with her old nurse, or with &quot;God's folk&quot; who 
                sometimes came by the back door to see her.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. 
                She feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and 
                amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, 
                but she did not understand the significance of this war, which 
                seemed to her like all previous wars. She did not realize the 
                significance of this war, though Dessalles with whom she constantly 
                conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried 
                to explain his own conception of it to her, and though the &quot;God's 
                folk&quot; who came to see her reported, in their own way, the 
                rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist, 
                and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskaya), who had resumed correspondence 
                with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I write you in Russian, my good friend,&quot; wrote 
                Julie in her Frenchified Russian, &quot;because I have a detestation 
                for all the French, and the same for their language which I cannot 
                support to hear spoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm 
                for our adored Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish 
                taverns, but the news which I have inspires me yet more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski, 
                embracing his two sons and saying: 'I will perish with them but 
                we will not be shaken!' And truly though the enemy was twice stronger 
                than we, we were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in 
                war as in war! The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days 
                with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make beautiful conversations 
                over our charpie, only you, my friend, are missing...&quot; and 
                so on.</p>
              <p> 　　The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance 
                of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not 
                recognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at 
                dinner. The prince's tone was so calm and confident that Princess 
                Mary unhesitatingly believed him.</p>
              <p> 　　All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even 
                animated. He planned another garden and began a new building for 
                the domestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious 
                about him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping 
                in his study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One 
                day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, 
                another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in 
                the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while- instead 
                of Mademoiselle Bourienne- a serf boy read to him. Then again 
                he would spend a night in the dining room.</p>
              <p> 　　On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. 
                In his first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince 
                Andrew had dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he 
                had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. 
                To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and 
                from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at at Prince Andrew's 
                second letter, written near Vitebsk after the French had occupied 
                that town, gave a brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed 
                for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress 
                of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father 
                the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war 
                and on the army's direct line of march, and advised him to move 
                to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner that day, on Dessalles' mentioning that the French 
                were said to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered 
                his son's letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,&quot; he 
                said to Princess Mary- &quot;Haven't you read it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Father,&quot; she replied in a frightened voice.</p>
              <p> 　　She could not have read the letter as she did not even know 
                it had arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He writes about this war,&quot; said the prince, with 
                the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of 
                the present war.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That must be very interesting,&quot; said Dessalles. 
                &quot;Prince Andrew is in a position to know...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, very interesting!&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go and get it for me,&quot; said the old prince to Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne. &quot;You know- under the paperweight on the little 
                table.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, don't!&quot; he exclaimed with a frown. &quot;You 
                go, Michael Ivanovich.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study. But as soon 
                as he had left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, 
                threw down his napkin and went himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They can't do anything... always make some muddle,&quot; 
                he muttered.</p>
              <p> 　　While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince 
                returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivanovich, bringing 
                the letter and a plan. These he put down beside him- not letting 
                anyone read them at dinner.</p>
              <p> 　　On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess 
                Mary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building 
                and fixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. 
                When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. 
                He was examining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you think of it, Prince?&quot; Dessalles ventured 
                to ask.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? I?...&quot; said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, 
                and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to 
                us that...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ha ha ha! The theater of war!&quot; said the prince. 
                &quot;I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland 
                and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking 
                of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess 
                Mary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought 
                that what her father was saying was correct.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When the snow melts they'll sink in the Polish swamps. 
                Only they could fail to see it,&quot; the prince continued, evidently 
                thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. 
                &quot;Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner, then 
                things would have taken a different turn...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Prince,&quot; Dessalles began timidly, &quot;the 
                letter mentions Vitebsk....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, the letter? Yes...&quot; replied the prince peevishly. 
                &quot;Yes... yes...&quot; His face suddenly took on a morose expression. 
                He paused. &quot;Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at... 
                at... what river is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dessalles dropped his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The prince says nothing about that,&quot; he remarked 
                gently.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Doesn't he? But I didn't invent it myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No one spoke for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivanovich,&quot; he suddenly 
                went on, raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, 
                &quot;tell me how you mean to alter it....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan, and the prince after 
                speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess 
                Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary saw Dessalles' embarrassed and astonished look 
                fixed on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the 
                fact that her father had forgotten his son's letter on the drawing-room 
                table; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles 
                the reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to 
                think about it.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening Michael Ivanovich, sent by the prince, came 
                to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew's letter which had been forgotten 
                in the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it 
                was to her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always busy,&quot; replied Michael Ivanovich with a 
                respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. 
                &quot;He's worrying very much about the new building. He has been 
                reading a little, but now&quot;- Michael Ivanovich went on, lowering 
                his voice- &quot;now he's at his desk, busy with his will, I expect.&quot; 
                (One of the prince's favorite occupations of late had been the 
                preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and 
                which he called his &quot;will.&quot;)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk?&quot; asked 
                Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.&quot;

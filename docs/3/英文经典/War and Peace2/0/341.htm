              <p> 　　The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. 
                The waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface 
                eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine 
                that they have caused the floods to abate.</p>
              <p> 　　But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists 
                think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure 
                of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; 
                the position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to 
                be rising does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises 
                again from the same point as before- Paris. The last backwash 
                of the movement from the west occurs: a backwash which serves 
                to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and 
                ends the military movement of that period of history.</p>
              <p> 　　The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, 
                without any conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest 
                him, but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously 
                greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again 
                a month later.</p>
              <p> 　　This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.</p>
              <p> 　　That act is performed.</p>
              <p> 　　The last role is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and 
                wash off his powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.</p>
              <p> 　　And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy 
                to himself in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by 
                intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed, 
                and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had 
                mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions.</p>
              <p> 　　The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped 
                the actor shows him to us.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;See what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see 
                that it was not he but I who moved you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before 
                people understood this.</p>
              <p> 　　Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life 
                of Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement 
                from east to west.</p>
              <p> 　　What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at 
                the head of that movement from east to west?</p>
              <p> 　　What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with 
                European affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; 
                a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated 
                with him; a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance 
                against Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this 
                had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: 
                his education, his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded 
                him, and by Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.</p>
              <p> 　　During the national war he was inactive because he was not 
                needed. But as soon as the necessity for a general European war 
                presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment 
                and, uniting the nations of Europe, led them to the goal.</p>
              <p> 　　The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander 
                possesses all possible power. How does he use it?</p>
              <p> 　　Alexander I- the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his 
                early years had striven only for his people's welfare, the originator 
                of the liberal innovations in his fatherland- now that he seemed 
                to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility 
                of bringing about the welfare of his peoples- at the time when 
                Napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans 
                of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power- 
                Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand 
                of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that 
                supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands 
                of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too 
                am a man like the rest of you. Let me live like a man and think 
                of my soul and of God.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in 
                itself, and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense 
                for man to comprehend, so each individual has within himself his 
                own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible 
                to man.</p>
              <p> 　　A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child 
                is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. 
                A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and 
                says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, 
                seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the 
                hive, says that it exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper who 
                has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee 
                gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen, and 
                that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that 
                the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes 
                the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee's existence. 
                Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the bee 
                helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose 
                of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted 
                by the first, the second, or any of the processes the human mind 
                can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery 
                of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate 
                purpose is beyond our comprehension.</p>
              <p> 　　All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life 
                of the bee to other manifestations of life. And so it is with 
                the purpose of historic characters and nations.</p>

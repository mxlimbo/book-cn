              <p> 　　The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o'clock 
                at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the 
                wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving.</p>
              <p> 　　The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took 
                place at the Stone, Moskva, and Yauza bridges.</p>
              <p> 　　While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around 
                the Kremlin, were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges, 
                a great many soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, 
                turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently 
                past the church of Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski 
                gate, back up the hill to the Red Square where some instinct told 
                them they could easily take things not belonging to them. Crowds 
                of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys 
                of the Bazaar. But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating 
                affability inviting customers to enter; there were no hawkers, 
                nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers- but only soldiers, 
                in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets, entering the 
                Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through 
                its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants (of 
                whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite 
                bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, 
                and themselves carried goods away with the help their assistants. 
                On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the 
                muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting 
                soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made 
                them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in 
                the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, 
                with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over 
                his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other 
                in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street, 
                talking. A third officer galloped up to them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The general orders them all to be driven out at once, 
                without fail. This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you off to?... Where?...&quot; he shouted 
                to three infantrymen without muskets who, holding up the skirts 
                of their overcoats, were slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. 
                &quot;Stop, you rascals!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how are you going to stop them?&quot; replied another 
                officer. &quot;There is no getting them together. The army should 
                push on before the rest bolt, that's all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on 
                the bridge, and don't move. Shouldn't we put a cordon round to 
                prevent the rest from running away?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, go in there and drive them out!&quot; shouted 
                the senior officer.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, 
                and went with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running 
                away in a group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near 
                the nose, and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his 
                plump face, hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, 
                swinging his arms.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor!&quot; said he. &quot;Be so good as to protect 
                us! We won't grudge trifles, you are welcome to anything- we shall 
                be delighted! Pray!... I'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for 
                such an honorable gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure. 
                For we feel how it is; but what's all this- sheer robbery! If 
                you please, could not guards be placed if only to let us close 
                the shop....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, what twaddle!&quot; said one of them, a thin, stern-looking 
                man. &quot;When one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's 
                hair! Take what any of you like!&quot; And flourishing his arm 
                energetically he turned sideways to the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all very well for you, Ivan Sidorych, to talk,&quot; 
                said the first tradesman angrily. &quot;Please step inside, your 
                honor!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Talk indeed!&quot; cried the thin one. &quot;In my three 
                shops here I have a hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods. Can 
                they be saved when the army has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against 
                God's might our hands can't fight.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come inside, your honor!&quot; repeated the tradesman, 
                bowing.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not my business!&quot; he exclaimed, and strode 
                on quickly down one of the passages.</p>
              <p> 　　From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, 
                and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with 
                a shaven head was flung out violently.</p>
              <p> 　　This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. 
                The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but 
                at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd 
                on the Moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? What is it?&quot; he asked, but his comrade 
                was already galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction 
                from which the screams came.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he 
                reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing 
                the bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing 
                faces among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing 
                to which two horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars 
                were pressing close to the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and 
                at the very top, beside a child's chair with its legs in the air, 
                sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks. He 
                was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd 
                and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General 
                Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were 
                dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the 
                bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show 
                of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting 
                carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately, had cleared off 
                the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.</p>

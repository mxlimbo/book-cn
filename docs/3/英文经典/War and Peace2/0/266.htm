              <p> 　　Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from 
                Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that 
                event. This messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know 
                Russian, but who was quoique etranger, russe de coeur et d'ame,* 
                as he said of himself. </p>
              <p> 　　*Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul. </p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at 
                the palace on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow 
                before the campaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply 
                moved (as he wrote) when he appeared before notre tres gracieux 
                souverain* with the news of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes 
                eclairaient sa route.*[2] </p>
              <p> 　　*Our most gracious sovereign.</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] Whose flames illumined his route. </p>
              <p> 　　Though the source of M. Michaud's chagrin must have been different 
                from that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face 
                when shown into the Emperor's study that the latter at once asked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very sad, sire,&quot; replied Michaud, lowering his 
                eyes with a sigh. &quot;The abandonment of Moscow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?&quot; 
                asked the Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.</p>
              <p> 　　Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted 
                to him, which was that it had been impossible to fight before 
                Moscow, and that as the only remaining choice was between losing 
                the army as well as Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field 
                marshal had to choose the latter.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has the enemy entered the city?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all 
                in flames,&quot; replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing 
                at the Emperor he was frightened by what he had done.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower 
                lip trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if 
                blaming himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed 
                Michaud in a firm voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence 
                requires great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself 
                in all things to His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave 
                the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? 
                Did you not notice discouragement?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud 
                also grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the 
                Emperor's direct and relevant question which required a direct 
                answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a 
                loyal soldier?&quot; he asked to gain time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Colonel, I always require it,&quot; replied the Emperor. 
                &quot;Conceal nothing from me, I wish to know absolutely how things 
                are.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire!&quot; said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible 
                smile on his lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, &quot;sire, 
                I left the whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, 
                without exception in desperate and agonized terror...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is that?&quot; the Emperor interrupted him, frowning 
                sternly. &quot;Would misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... 
                Never!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he 
                had prepared.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire,&quot; he said, with respectful playfulness, &quot;they 
                are only afraid lest Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, 
                should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace. They are 
                burning for the combat,&quot; declared this representative of 
                the Russian nation, &quot;and to prove to Your Majesty by the 
                sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly 
                gleam in his eyes, he patted Michaud on the shoulder. &quot;You 
                set me at ease, Colonel.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He bent his head and was silent for some time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, go back to the army,&quot; he said, drawing 
                himself up to his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious 
                and majestic gesture, &quot;and tell our brave men and all my 
                good subjects wherever you go that when I have not a soldier left 
                I shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good 
                peasants and so use the last resources of my empire. It still 
                offers me more than my enemies suppose,&quot; said the Emperor 
                growing more and more animated; &quot;but should it ever be ordained 
                by Divine Providence,&quot; he continued, raising to heaven his 
                fine eyes shining with emotion, &quot;that my dynasty should cease 
                to reign on the throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting 
                all the means at my command, I shall let my beard grow to here&quot; 
                (he pointed halfway down his chest) &quot;and go and eat potatoes 
                with the meanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace 
                of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know 
                how to appreciate.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor 
                suddenly turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that 
                rose to his eyes, and went to the further end of his study. Having 
                stood there a few moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed 
                his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement. The Emperor's 
                mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution 
                and anger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, 
                perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or 
                I,&quot; said the Emperor, touching his breast. &quot;We can no 
                longer both reign together. I have learned to know him, and he 
                will not deceive me any more....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the Emperor paused, with a frown.</p>
              <p> 　　When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution 
                in the Emperor's eyes, Michaud- quoique etranger, russe de coeur 
                et d'ame- at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all 
                that he had heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave expression 
                to his own feelings and those of the Russian people whose representative 
                he considered himself to be, in the following words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire!&quot; said he, &quot;Your Majesty is at this moment 
                signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of Europe!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.</p>

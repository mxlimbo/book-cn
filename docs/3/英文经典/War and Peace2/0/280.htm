              <p> 　　Man's mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, 
                but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man's soul. 
                And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the 
                conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the 
                cause, he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that 
                seems to him intelligible and says: &quot;This is the cause!&quot; 
                In historical events (where the actions of men are the subject 
                of observation) the first and most primitive approximation to 
                present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will 
                of those who stood in the most prominent position- the heroes 
                of history. But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic 
                event- which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who 
                take part in it- to be convinced that the will of the historic 
                hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually 
                controlled. It may seem to be a matter of indifference whether 
                we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that; 
                yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the 
                people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon wished it 
                and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen, 
                as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary 
                and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that 
                they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there were laws 
                directing its movement and that of the other planets. There is, 
                and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause 
                of all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of 
                these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we 
                cannot comprehend. The discovery of these laws is only possible 
                when possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find 
                the cause in the will of some one man, just as the discovery of 
                the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men 
                abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodino 
                and the occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction 
                by fire, the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the 
                movement of the Russian army from the Ryazana to the Kaluga road 
                and to the Tarutino camp- the so-called flank march across the 
                Krasnaya Pakhra River. They ascribe the glory of that achievement 
                of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is 
                due. Even foreign historians, including the French, acknowledge 
                the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of that flank 
                march. But it is hard to understand why military writers, and 
                following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound 
                conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. 
                In the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity 
                and genius of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was 
                needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not 
                being attacked is where there are most provisions; and even a 
                dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position 
                for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on the Kaluga 
                road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the 
                historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound 
                one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why they 
                think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy 
                the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied, 
                or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous 
                to the Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of 
                the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that 
                march, it does not at all follow that the march was the cause 
                of it.</p>
              <p> 　　That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage 
                to the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led 
                to its destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned 
                down? If Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon 
                had not remained inactive? If the Russian army at Krasnaya Pakhra 
                had given battle as Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would 
                have happened had the French attacked the Russians while they 
                were marching beyond the Pakhra? What would have happened if on 
                approaching Tarutino, Napoleon had attacked the Russians with 
                but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at 
                Smolensk? What would have happened had the French moved on Petersburg?... 
                In any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation 
                might have proved disastrous.</p>
              <p> 　　The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying 
                history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot 
                be attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and 
                that in reality, like the retreat from Fili, it did not suggest 
                itself to anyone in its entirety, but resulted- moment by moment, 
                step by step, event by event- from an endless number of most diverse 
                circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been 
                accomplished and belonged to the past.</p>
              <p> 　　At the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds 
                of the Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, 
                namely, a direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of this 
                there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such 
                a retreat, and above all there is the well-known conversation 
                after the council, between the commander in chief and Lanskoy, 
                who was in charge of the commissariat department. Lanskoy informed 
                the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most 
                part stored along the Oka in the Tula and Ryazan provinces, and 
                that if they retreated on Nizhni the army would be separated from 
                its supplies by the broad river Oka, which cannot be crossed early 
                in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity of deviating 
                from what had previously seemed the most natural course- a direct 
                retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod. The army turned more to the south, 
                along the Ryazan road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently 
                the in activity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian 
                army), concern for the safety of the arsenal at Tula, and especially 
                the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army 
                to turn still further south to the Tula road. Having crossed over, 
                by a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the Pakhra, the Russian 
                commanders intended to remain at Podolsk and had no thought of 
                the Tarutino position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance 
                of French troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, 
                and projects of giving battle, and above all the abundance of 
                provisions in Kaluga province, obliged our army to turn still 
                more to the south and to cross from the Tula to the Kaluga road 
                and go to Tarutino, which was between the roads along which those 
                supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided 
                to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, 
                or by whom, it was decided to move to Tarutino. Only when the 
                army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, 
                did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this 
                movement and long ago foreseen its result.</p>

              <p> 　　When the troops reached their night's halting place on the 
                eighth of November, the last day of the Krasnoe battles, it was 
                already growing dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with 
                occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to 
                clear. Through the falling snow a purple-black and starry sky 
                showed itself and the frost grew keener.</p>
              <p> 　　An infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand 
                strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first 
                to arrive that night at its halting place- a village on the highroad. 
                The quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the 
                huts were full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members 
                of the staff. There was only one hut available for the regimental 
                commander.</p>
              <p> 　　The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through 
                the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.</p>
              <p> 　　Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare 
                its lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep 
                through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, 
                and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of 
                branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another 
                section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing 
                in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and 
                feeding the horses. A third section scattered through the village 
                arranging quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French 
                corpses that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, 
                and thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences 
                to serve for shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high 
                wattle wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, all together- shove!&quot; cried the voices, 
                and the huge surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking 
                with frost, was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower 
                stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell, and with 
                it the men who had been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and 
                joyous shouts ensued.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That's 
                it... Where are you shoving to?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a 
                song!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began 
                to sing. At the end of the third verse as the last note died away, 
                twenty voices roared out at once: &quot;Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. 
                All together! Heave away, boys!...&quot; but despite their united 
                efforts the wattle hardly moved, and in the silence that followed 
                the heavy breathing of the men was audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! 
                Lend a hand... will you? You may want us one of these days.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way 
                into the village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which 
                was about thirty-five feet long an seven feet high, moved forward 
                along the village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the 
                shoulders of the gasping men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There 
                now...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you up to?&quot; suddenly came the authoritative 
                voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling 
                their burden. &quot;There are gentry here; the general himself 
                is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I'll 
                give it to you!&quot; shouted he, hitting the first man who came 
                in his way a swinging blow on the back. &quot;Can't you make less 
                noise?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned 
                and wiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his 
                falling against the wattle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, how that devil hits out! He's made my face all 
                bloody,&quot; said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant 
                major had passed on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you like it?&quot; said a laughing voice, and 
                moderating their tones the men moved forward.</p>
              <p> 　　When they were out of the village they began talking again 
                as loud as before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless 
                expletives.</p>
              <p> 　　In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had 
                gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events 
                of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed 
                to make a flank march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) 
                and capture him.</p>
              <p> 　　By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its 
                place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, 
                the wood crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of 
                soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where 
                the snow had been trodden down.</p>
              <p> 　　Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done 
                without any orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for 
                the night, shelters were rigged up for the officers, caldrons 
                were being boiled, and muskets and accouterments put in order.</p>
              <p> 　　The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle 
                by the Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up 
                by musket rests, and a campfire was built before it. They beat 
                the tattoo, called the roll, had supper, and settled down round 
                the fires for the night- some repairing their footgear, some smoking 
                pipes, and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out 
                of their shirts. </p>

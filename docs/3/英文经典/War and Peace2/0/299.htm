              <p> 　　The Battle of Borodino, with the occupation of Moscow that 
                followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts, 
                is one of the most instructive phenomena in history.</p>
              <p> 　　All historians agree that the external activity of states 
                and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in 
                wars, and that as a direct result of greater or less success in 
                war the political strength of states and nations increases or 
                decreases.</p>
              <p> 　　Strange as may be the historical account of how some king 
                or emperor, having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights 
                his enemy's army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten 
                thousand men, and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of 
                several millions, all the facts of history (as far as we know 
                it) confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser 
                success of one army against another is the cause, or at least 
                an essential indication, of an increase or decrease in the strength 
                of the nation- even though it is unintelligible why the defeat 
                of an army- a hundredth part of a nation- should oblige that whole 
                nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the rights 
                of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the 
                defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses 
                its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if 
                its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.</p>
              <p> 　　So according to history it has been found from the most ancient 
                times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon's wars serve 
                to confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian 
                army Austria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength 
                of France increase. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt 
                destroy the independent existence of Prussia.</p>
              <p> 　　But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. 
                Moscow is taken and after that, with no further battles, it is 
                not Russia that ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred 
                thousand, and then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts 
                to fit the rules of history: to say that the field of battle at 
                Borodino remained in the hands of the Russians, or that after 
                Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon's army, 
                is impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　After the French victory at Borodino there was no general 
                engagement nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army 
                ceased to exist. What does this mean? If it were an example taken 
                from the history of China, we might say that it was not an historic 
                phenomenon (which is the historians' usual expedient when anything 
                does not fit their standards); if the matter concerned some brief 
                conflict in which only a small number of troops took part, we 
                might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before 
                our fathers' eyes, and for them it was a question of the life 
                or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest 
                of all known wars.</p>
              <p> 　　The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino 
                to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle 
                does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication 
                of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of 
                peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, 
                but in something else.</p>
              <p> 　　The French historians, describing the condition of the French 
                army before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the 
                Grand Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport- 
                there was no forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune 
                no one could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their 
                hay rather than let the French have it.</p>
              <p> 　　The victory gained did not bring the usual results because 
                the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated 
                Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general 
                personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole 
                innumerable multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay 
                to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it instead.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with 
                rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The 
                fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, 
                feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no 
                joke but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing 
                the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then 
                let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the 
                best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time 
                influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal 
                the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory 
                with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine 
                what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account 
                of the duel.</p>
              <p> 　　The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of 
                fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier 
                and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try 
                to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the 
                historians who have described the event.</p>
              <p> 　　After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow 
                any previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, 
                the retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the 
                renewed retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, 
                the seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures 
                from the rules.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct 
                fencing attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent's rapier 
                saw a cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease to complain 
                to Kutuzov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being 
                carried on contrary to all the rules- as if there were any rules 
                for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the French as 
                to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to 
                some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight 
                with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en 
                tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrust 
                en prime, and so on- the cudgel of the people's war was lifted 
                with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting 
                anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose 
                and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored 
                the French till the whole invasion had perished.</p>
              <p> 　　And it is well for a people who do not- as the French did 
                in 1813- salute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting 
                the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their 
                magnanimous conqueror, but at the moment of trial, without asking 
                what rules others have adopted in similar cases, simply and easily 
                pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it 
                till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields 
                to a feeling of contempt and compassion. </p>

              <p> 　　The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French 
                into Smolensk.</p>
              <p> 　　Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by 
                the government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and 
                foragers had been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, 
                who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad 
                dog to death. Denis Davydov, with his Russian instinct, was the 
                first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless 
                of the rules of military science destroyed the French, and to 
                him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing 
                this method of warfare.</p>
              <p> 　　On August 24 Davydov's first partisan detachment was formed 
                and then others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed 
                the more numerous these detachments became.</p>
              <p> 　　The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered 
                the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered 
                tree- the French army- and sometimes shook that tree itself. By 
                October, when the French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were 
                hundreds of such companies, of various sizes and characters. There 
                were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry, 
                artillery, staffs, and the comforts of life. Others consisted 
                solely of Cossack cavalry. There were also small scratch groups 
                of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and landowners that 
                remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which captured 
                several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there 
                was Vasilisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of 
                the French.</p>
              <p> 　　The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter 
                days of October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans 
                themselves, amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute 
                to be surrounded and captured by the French, and hid in the forests 
                without unsaddling, hardly daring to dismount and always expecting 
                to be pursued. By the end of October this kind of warfare had 
                taken definite shape: it had become clear to all what could be 
                ventured against the French and what could not. Now only the commanders 
                of detachments with staffs, and moving according to rules at a 
                distance from the French, still regarded many things as impossible. 
                The small bands that had started their activities long before 
                and had already observed the French closely considered things 
                possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare 
                to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the 
                French now considered everything possible.</p>
              <p> 　　On October 22, Denisov (who was one of the irregulars) was 
                with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since 
                early morning he and his party had been on the move. All day long 
                he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad 
                a large French convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners 
                separated from the rest of the army, which- as was learned from 
                spies and prisoners- was moving under a strong escort to Smolensk. 
                Besides Denisov and Dolokhov (who also led a small party and moved 
                in Denisov's vicinity), the commanders of some large divisions 
                with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denisov expressed 
                it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders 
                of large parties- one a Pole and the other a German- sent invitations 
                to Denisov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with 
                their divisions to attack the convoy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,&quot; said 
                Denisov on reading these documents, and he wrote to the German 
                that, despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and 
                renowned a general, he had to forgo that pleasure because he was 
                already under the command of the Polish general. To the Polish 
                general he replied to the same effect, informing him that he was 
                already under the command of the German.</p>
              <p> 　　Having arranged matters thus, Denisov and Dolokhov intended, 
                without reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and 
                seize that convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it 
                was moving from the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo. 
                To the left of the road between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were 
                large forests, extending in some places up to the road itself 
                though in others a mile or more back from it. Through these forests 
                Denisov and his party rode all day, sometimes keeping well back 
                in them and sometimes coming to the very edge, but never losing 
                sight of the moving French. That morning, Cossacks of Denisov's 
                party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded 
                with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not far from 
                Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then, and 
                until evening, the party had the movements of the French without 
                attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo 
                quietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dolokhov 
                who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman's 
                hut in the forest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to surprise 
                the French at dawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from 
                two sides, and rout and capture them all at one blow.</p>
              <p> 　　In their rear, more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest 
                came right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report 
                if any fresh columns of French should show themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond Shamshevo, Dolokhov was to observe the road in the 
                same way, to find out at what distance there were other French 
                troops. They reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. 
                Denisov had two hundred, and Dolokhov might have as many more, 
                but the disparity of numbers did not deter Denisov. All that he 
                now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that 
                he had to capture a &quot;tongue&quot;- that is, a man from the 
                enemy column. That morning's attack on the wagons had been made 
                so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; 
                only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was 
                a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops 
                in that column.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for 
                fear of putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon 
                Shcherbaty, a peasant of his party, to Shamshevo to try and seize 
                at least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on 
                in advance. </p>

              <p> 　　As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects 
                of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner 
                until after they were over. After his liberation he reached Orel, 
                and on the third day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell 
                ill and was laid up for three months. He had what the doctors 
                termed &quot;bilious fever.&quot; But despite the fact that the 
                doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, 
                he recovered.</p>
              <p> 　　Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by all that 
                happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. 
                He remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, 
                internal physical distress, and pains in his feet and side. He 
                remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings 
                of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and 
                generals who questioned him, he also remembered his difficulty 
                in procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he remembered 
                his incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of 
                his rescue he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. That same day 
                he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle 
                of Borodino for more than a month had recently died in the Rostovs' 
                house at Yaroslavl, and Denisov who told him this news also mentioned 
                Helene's death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. 
                All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt 
                he could not grasp its significance. Just then he was only anxious 
                to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were 
                killing one another, to some peaceful refuge where he could recover 
                himself, rest, and think over all the strange new facts he had 
                learned; but on reaching Orel he immediately fell ill. When he 
                came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him 
                two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had come from Moscow; 
                and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been living on 
                his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had 
                come to look after him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre 
                lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last 
                few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him 
                to go anywhere tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his 
                warm bed, and that he would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and 
                supper. But for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself 
                in the conditions of captivity. In the same way little by little 
                he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue, 
                about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the 
                destruction of the French.</p>
              <p> 　　A joyous feeling of freedom- that complete inalienable freedom 
                natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt 
                outside Moscow- filled Pierre's soul during his convalescence. 
                He was surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent 
                of external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting 
                of external liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. 
                No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all 
                he wanted: the thought of his wife which had been a continual 
                torment to him was no longer there, since she was no more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how good! How splendid!&quot; said he to himself 
                when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef 
                tea, or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed, or 
                when he remembered that the French had gone and that his wife 
                was no more. &quot;Oh, how good, how splendid!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And by old habit he asked himself the question: &quot;Well, 
                and what then? What am I going to do?&quot; And he immediately 
                gave himself the answer: &quot;Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing 
                he had continually sought to find- the aim of life- no longer 
                existed for him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely 
                disappeared temporarily- he felt that it no longer existed for 
                him and could not present itself again. And this very absence 
                of an aim gave him the complete, joyous sense of freedom which 
                constituted his happiness at this time.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not see an aim, for he now had faith- not faith in 
                any kind of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, 
                ever-manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. 
                That search for an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly 
                in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but 
                by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God 
                is here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in 
                Karataev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than 
                in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. 
                He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the 
                far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life 
                he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should 
                have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable 
                infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere 
                and had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he 
                had only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. 
                He had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into 
                remote space, where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance 
                had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not 
                clearly seen. And such had European life, politics, Freemasonry, 
                philosophy, and philanthropy seemed to him. But even then, at 
                moments of weakness as he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated 
                to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, 
                and senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, 
                eternal, and infinite in everything, and therefore- to see it 
                and enjoy its contemplation- he naturally threw away the telescope 
                through which he had till now gazed over men's heads, and gladly 
                regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and 
                infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil 
                and happy he became. That dreadful question, &quot;What for?&quot; 
                which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer 
                existed for him. To that question, &quot;What for?&quot; a simple 
                answer was now always ready in his soul: &quot;Because there is 
                a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from a man's 
                head.&quot;</p>

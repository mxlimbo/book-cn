              <p> 　　In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused of blundering. 
                The Emperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently 
                written by order of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutuzov 
                was a cunning court liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, 
                and that by his blunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he deprived 
                the Russian army of the glory of complete victory over the French.* 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*History of the year 1812. The character of Kutuzov and reflections 
                on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at Krasnoe, by Bogdanovich. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the 
                Russian mind does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always 
                solitary individuals who, discerning the will of Providence, submit 
                their personal will to it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd 
                punish such men for discerning the higher laws.</p>
              <p> 　　For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon- 
                that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even 
                in exile, showed human dignity- Napoleon is the object of adulation 
                and enthusiasm; he is grand. But Kutuzov- the man who from the 
                beginning to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving 
                by word or deed from Borodino to Vilna, presented an example exceptional 
                in history of self-sacrifice and a present conciousness of the 
                future importance of what was happening- Kutuzov seems to them 
                something indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and 
                of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed.</p>
              <p> 　　And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character 
                whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and 
                it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant 
                with the will of the whole people. Still more difficult would 
                it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical 
                personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all 
                Kutuzov's efforts were directed in 1812.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov never talked of &quot;forty centuries looking down 
                from the Pyramids,&quot; of the sacrifices he offered for the 
                fatherland, or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; 
                in general he said nothing about himself, adopted no prose, always 
                appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said 
                the simplest and most ordinary things. He wrote letters to his 
                daughters and to Madame de Stael, read novels, liked the society 
                of pretty women, jested with generals, officers, and soldiers, 
                and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him. 
                When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza bridge galloped up to Kutuzov 
                with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of 
                Moscow, and said: &quot;How was it you promised not to abandon 
                Moscow without a battle?&quot; Kutuzov replied: &quot;And I shall 
                not abandon Moscow without a battle,&quot; though Moscow was then 
                already abandoned. When Arakcheev, coming to him from the Emperor, 
                said that Ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, 
                Kutuzov replied: &quot;Yes, I was just saying so myself,&quot; 
                though a moment before he had said quite the contrary. What did 
                it matter to him- who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood 
                the whole tremendous significance of what was happening- what 
                did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed the calamities 
                of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to 
                him who was appointed chief of the artillery.</p>
              <p> 　　Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man- 
                who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts 
                and the words serving as their expression are not what move people- 
                use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head.</p>
              <p> 　　But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during 
                the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with 
                the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. 
                Obviously in spite of himself, in very diverse circumstances, 
                he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction 
                that he would not be understood. Beginning with the battle of 
                Borodino, from which time his disagreement with those about him 
                began, he alone said that the battle of Borodino was a victory, 
                and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports 
                up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of Moscow 
                is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston's proposal of 
                peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people's 
                will. He alone during the retreat of the French said that all 
                our maneuvers are useless, everything is being accomplished of 
                itself better than we could desire; that the enemy must be offered 
                &quot;a golden bridge&quot;; that neither the Tarutino, the Vyazma, 
                nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some 
                force to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice 
                a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.</p>
              <p> 　　And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakcheev 
                to please the Emperor, he alone- incurring thereby the Emperor's 
                displeasure- said in Vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier 
                is useless and harmful.</p>
              <p> 　　Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning 
                of the events. His actions- without the smallest deviation- were 
                all directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all 
                his strength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, 
                and (3) to drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible 
                the sufferings of our people and of our army.</p>
              <p> 　　This procrastinator Kutuzov, whose motto was &quot;Patience 
                and Time,&quot; this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at 
                Borodino, investing the preparations for it with unparalleled 
                solemnity. This Kutuzov who before the battle of Austerlitz began 
                said that it would be lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone 
                else, declared till his death that Borodino was a victory, despite 
                the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite 
                the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle 
                was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted 
                that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and 
                that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia 
                crossed.</p>
              <p> 　　It is easy now to understand the significance of these events- 
                if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass 
                aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals- for 
                the events and results now lie before us.</p>
              <p> 　　But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general 
                opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view 
                of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue 
                to it?</p>
              <p> 　　The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the 
                meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling 
                which he possessed in full purity and strength.</p>
              <p> 　　Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling 
                caused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's 
                wish, to select him- an old man in disfavor- to be their representative 
                in the national war. And only that feeling placed him on that 
                highest human pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, 
                devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to 
                saving and showing pity on them.</p>
              <p> 　　That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could 
                not be cast in the false mold of a European hero- the supposed 
                ruler of men- that history has invented.</p>
              <p> 　　To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own 
                conception of greatness. </p>

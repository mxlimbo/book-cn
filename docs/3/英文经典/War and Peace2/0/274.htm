          <tr> 
            <td>
              <p> 　　From Prince Shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight 
                down the Virgin's Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as 
                a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up. Beyond that 
                post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground, and near the post 
                and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted 
                of a few Russians and many of Napoleon's soldiers who were not 
                on duty- Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. 
                To the right and left of the post stood rows of French troops 
                in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos.</p>
              <p> 　　The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to 
                the list (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several 
                drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that 
                sound Pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He 
                lost the power of thinking or understanding. He could only hear 
                and see. And he had only one wish- that the frightful thing that 
                had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre looked round at his 
                fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.</p>
              <p> 　　The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall 
                and thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. 
                The third was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with 
                grizzled hair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was 
                a peasant, a very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard 
                and black eyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced 
                lad of eighteen in a loose coat.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately 
                or two at a time. &quot;In couples,&quot; replied the officer 
                in command in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the 
                soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying- not as 
                men hurry to do something they understand, but as people hurry 
                to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task.</p>
              <p> 　　A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of 
                the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and 
                in French.</p>
              <p> 　　Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at 
                the officer's command took the two convicts who stood first in 
                the row. The convicts stopped when they reached the post and, 
                while sacks were being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded 
                beast looks at an approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, 
                the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling 
                a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing 
                the sacks over their heads, and bound them to the post.</p>
              <p> 　　Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks 
                with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. 
                Pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly 
                a crackling, rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder 
                than the most terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was 
                some smoke, and the Frenchmen were doing something near the pit, 
                with pale faces and trembling hands. Two more prisoners were led 
                up. In the same way and with similar looks, these two glanced 
                vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection 
                in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe what 
                was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because 
                they alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither 
                understood nor believed that it could be taken from them.</p>
              <p> 　　Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but 
                again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and 
                at the same moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces 
                of the Frenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their 
                trembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, 
                looked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was 
                expressed in all the looks that met his.</p>
              <p> 　　On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers 
                and officers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, 
                and conflict that were in his own heart. &quot;But who, after 
                all, is doing this? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is 
                it? Who?&quot; flashed for an instant through his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!&quot; shouted someone. 
                The fifth prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away- alone. 
                Pierre did not understand that he was saved, that he and the rest 
                had been brought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing 
                horror, and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking 
                place. The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The 
                moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched 
                at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad 
                was unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under 
                the arms, and he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew 
                quiet, as if he suddenly understood something. Whether he understood 
                that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible 
                that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at the 
                post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded 
                animal looked around him with glittering eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. 
                His curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached 
                the highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth 
                man seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed 
                one bare foot with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot 
                which hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against 
                the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable 
                in that position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and 
                leaned back again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes 
                from him and did not miss his slightest movement.</p>
              <p> 　　Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the 
                reports of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not 
                afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. 
                He only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that 
                held him, how blood showed itself in two places, how the ropes 
                slackened under the weight of the hanging body, and how the workman 
                sat down, his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under 
                him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened 
                people were doing something around the workman. The lower jaw 
                of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied 
                the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly 
                from the post and began pushing it into the pit.</p>
              <p> 　　They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals 
                who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was 
                lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher 
                than the other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, 
                but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole 
                body. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly 
                and angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand 
                him and remained near the post, and no one drove him away.</p>
              <p> 　　When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre 
                was taken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides 
                of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. 
                The twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing 
                in the center of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies 
                passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who 
                ran in couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. 
                This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed 
                back, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the 
                pit at the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken 
                man, taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. 
                An old, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking 
                him by the elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians 
                and Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and 
                with drooping heads.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That will teach them to start fires,&quot; said one 
                of the Frenchmen.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a 
                soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been 
                done, but was not able to do so. Without finishing what he had 
                begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went 
                away. </p>

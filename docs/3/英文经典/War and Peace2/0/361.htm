              <p> 　　 If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment 
                of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have 
                finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. 
                A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the 
                law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but 
                man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and 
                am therefore not subject to the law.</p>
              <p> 　　The presence of the problem of man's free will, though unexpressed, 
                is felt at every step of history.</p>
              <p> 　　All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered 
                this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history 
                and the false path historical science has followed are due solely 
                to the lack of a solution of that question.</p>
              <p> 　　If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could 
                act as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected 
                incidents.</p>
              <p> 　　If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act 
                freely, that is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free 
                act of that man's in violation of the laws governing human action 
                would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for 
                the whole of humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free 
                will cannot exist, for then man's will is subject to that law.</p>
              <p> 　　In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which 
                from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and 
                from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous 
                significance.</p>
              <p> 　　The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation 
                from whatever point of view- theological, historical, ethical, 
                or philosophic- we find a general law of necessity to which he 
                (like all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within 
                ourselves as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be 
                free.</p>
              <p> 　　This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart 
                from and independent of reason. Through his reason man observes 
                himself, but only through consciousness does he know himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application 
                of reason is conceivable.</p>
              <p> 　　To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first 
                of all be conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious 
                of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, 
                is conscious of his volition. But his will- which forms the essence 
                of his life- man recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.</p>
              <p> 　　If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed 
                by one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of 
                taking food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize 
                this never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation 
                of it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man's will 
                seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of 
                it except as free.</p>
              <p> 　　You say: I am not and am not free. But I have lifted my hand 
                and let it fall. Everyone understands that this illogical reply 
                is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not 
                subject to reason.</p>
              <p> 　　If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent 
                source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning 
                and to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist 
                and is inconceivable.</p>
              <p> 　　A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man 
                that he, as an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, 
                and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity 
                or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them. But 
                the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that 
                the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible, 
                and that his every action depends on his organization, his character, 
                and the motives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the 
                deductions of these experiments and arguments. Having learned 
                from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man 
                indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has 
                learned to be fulfilled.</p>
              <p> 　　But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to 
                laws, he does not and cannot believe this.</p>
              <p> 　　However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that 
                under the same conditions and with the same character he will 
                do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions 
                and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time 
                the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly 
                convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. 
                Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment 
                may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different 
                courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that 
                without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence 
                of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible 
                it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not 
                only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable 
                to live for a single moment.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not live, because all man's efforts, all his impulses 
                to life, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, 
                fame and obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, 
                health and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion 
                and hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees 
                of freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived 
                of life.</p>
              <p> 　　If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless 
                contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at 
                one and the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, 
                that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.</p>
              <p> 　　This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled 
                by experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt 
                by everyone without exception, this consciousness without which 
                no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of 
                the question.</p>
              <p> 　　Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing 
                God. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness 
                of man's freedom? That is a question for theology.</p>
              <p> 　　The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed 
                in statistics. What is man's responsibility to society, the conception 
                of which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question 
                for jurisprudence.</p>
              <p> 　　Man's actions proceed from his innate character and the motives 
                acting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right 
                and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? 
                That is a question for ethics.</p>
              <p> 　　Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears 
                subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart 
                from that connection appears to free. How should the past life 
                of nations and of humanity be regarded- as the result of the free, 
                or as the result of the constrained, activity of man? That is 
                a question for history.</p>
              <p> 　　Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge- 
                thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion 
                of printed matter- has the question of the freedom of will been 
                put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our 
                time the majority of so-called advanced people- that is, the crowd 
                of ignoramuses- have taken the work of the naturalists who deal 
                with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.</p>
              <p> 　　They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do 
                not exist, for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements 
                and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the 
                nerves; the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown 
                period of time we sprang from the apes. They say this, not at 
                all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity 
                which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology 
                and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the 
                religions and all the thinkers, but has never been denied. They 
                do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter 
                is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one 
                side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of observation, 
                reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and that 
                man following the general law may have developed from lower animals 
                at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side 
                the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious 
                and philosophic theories- that from the point of view of reason 
                man is subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance 
                by a hair's breadth the solution of the question, which has another, 
                opposite, side, based on the consciousness of freedom.</p>
              <p> 　　If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, 
                that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful 
                of earth at a certain period of time (in the first case the unknown 
                quantity is the time, in the second case it is the origin); and 
                the question of how man's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled 
                with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved 
                by comparative physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, 
                or an ape, we can observe only the muscular nervous activity, 
                but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and 
                nervous activity.</p>
              <p> 　　The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve 
                this question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of 
                the walls of a church who, availing themselves of the absence 
                of the chief superintendent of the work, should in an access of 
                zeal plaster over the windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed 
                walls, and should be delighted that from their point of view as 
                plasterers, everything is now so smooth and regular. </p>

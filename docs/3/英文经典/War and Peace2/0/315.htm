              <p> 　　The movements of the Russian and French armies during the 
                campaign from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game 
                of Russian blindman's bluff, in which two players are blindfolded 
                and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the 
                catcher of his whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, 
                but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as 
                he can, and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent's 
                arms.</p>
              <p> 　　At first while they were still moving along the Kaluga road, 
                Napoleon's armies made their presence known, but later when they 
                reached the Smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their 
                bell tight- and often thinking they were escaping ran right into 
                the Russians.</p>
              <p> 　　Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian 
                pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief 
                means of approximately ascertaining the enemy's position- by cavalry 
                scouting- was not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent 
                and rapid change of position by each army, even what information 
                was obtained could not be delivered in time. If news was received 
                one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day 
                before, by the third day when something could have been done, 
                that army was already two days' march farther on and in quite 
                another position.</p>
              <p> 　　One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolensk there 
                were several different roads available for the French, and one 
                would have thought that during their stay of four days they might 
                have learned where the enemy was, might have arranged some more 
                advantageous plan and undertaken something new. But after a four 
                days' halt the mob, with no maneuvers or plans, again began running 
                along the beaten track, neither to the right nor to the left but 
                along the old- the worst- road, through Krasnoe and Orsha.</p>
              <p> 　　Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French 
                separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four 
                hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, 
                then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the 
                road to the right beyond the Dnieper- which was the only reasonable 
                thing for him to do- themselves turned to the right and came out 
                onto the highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a game of blindman's 
                buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy unexpectedly 
                the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden 
                fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their comrades 
                who were farther behind. Then for three days separate portions 
                of the French army- first Murat's (the vice-king's), then Davout's, 
                and then Ney's- ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian army. 
                They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage, 
                their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the 
                Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the 
                walls of Smolensk which were in nobody's way, because despite 
                the unfortunate plight of the French or because of it, they wished 
                to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, 
                who had had a corps of ten thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsha 
                with only one thousand men left, having abandoned all the rest 
                and all his cannon, and having crossed the Dnieper at night by 
                stealth at a wooded spot.</p>
              <p> 　　From Orsha they fled farther along the road to Vilna, still 
                playing at blindman's buff with the pursuing army. At the Berezina 
                they again became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, 
                but those who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme 
                chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, 
                galloped on alone, abandoning his companions. The others who could 
                do so drove away too, leaving those who could not to surrender 
                or die. </p>

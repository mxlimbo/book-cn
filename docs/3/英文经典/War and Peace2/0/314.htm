              <p> 　　After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, 
                the flight of the French assumed a still more tragic character, 
                with men freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, 
                while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive 
                past, carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor, 
                kings, and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration 
                of the French army went on essentially as before.</p>
              <p> 　　From Moscow to Vyazma the French army of seventy-three thousand 
                men not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole 
                war but pillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not 
                more than five thousand had fallen in battle. From this beginning 
                the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically. 
                The French army melted away and perished at the same rate from 
                Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the 
                Berezina, and from the Berezina to Vilna- independently of the 
                greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring 
                of the way, or any other particular conditions. Beyond Vyazma 
                the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled together 
                into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his 
                Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves 
                to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army) 
                and this is what he said: </p>
              <p> 　　I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition 
                of the various corps I have had occasion to observe during different 
                stages of the last two or three days' march. They are almost disbanded. 
                Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of 
                their regiments, the others go off by themselves in different 
                directions hoping to find food and escape discipline. In general 
                they regard Smolensk as the place where they hope to recover. 
                During the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw 
                away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state of affairs, 
                whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty's 
                service demands that the army should be rallied at Smolensk and 
                should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted 
                cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no 
                longer in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who 
                are worn out with hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well 
                as a few days' rest. Many have died last days on the road or at 
                the bivouacs. This state of things is continually becoming worse 
                and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the 
                troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement.</p>
              <p> 　　November 9: twenty miles from Smolensk. </p>
              <p> 　　After staggering into Smolensk which seemed to them a promised 
                land, the French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked 
                their own stores, and when everything had been plundered fled 
                farther.</p>
              <p> 　　They all went without knowing whither or why they were going. 
                Still less did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued 
                any orders to him. But still he and those about him retained their 
                old habits: wrote commands, letters, reports, and orders of the 
                day; called one another sire, mon cousin, prince d'Eckmuhl, roi 
                de Naples, and so on. But these orders and reports were only on 
                paper, nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried 
                out, and though they entitled one another Majesties, Highnesses, 
                or Cousins, they all felt that they were miserable wretches who 
                had done much evil for which they had now to pay. And though they 
                pretended to be concerned about the army, each was thinking only 
                of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself. </p>

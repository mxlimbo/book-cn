              <p> 　　The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal's baggage train 
                stopped at the village of Shamshevo. The men crowded together 
                round the campfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast 
                horseflesh, lay down with his back to the fire, and immediately 
                fell asleep. He again slept as he had done at Mozhaysk after the 
                battle of Borodino.</p>
              <p> 　　Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he 
                or another, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same 
                thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes 
                and moves and that movement is God. And while there is life there 
                is joy in consciousness of the divine. To love life is to love 
                God. Harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life 
                in one's sufferings, in innocent sufferings.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Karataev!&quot; came to Pierre's mind.</p>
              <p> 　　And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly 
                old man who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. &quot;Wait 
                a bit,&quot; said the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This 
                globe was alive- a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its 
                whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together, and 
                all these drops moved and changed places, sometimes several of 
                them merging into one, sometimes one dividing into many. Each 
                drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible, 
                but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes destroyed 
                it, and sometimes merged with it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is life,&quot; said the old teacher.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How simple and clear it is,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;How 
                is it I did not know it before?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so 
                as to reflect Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, 
                disappears from the surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. 
                There now, Karataev has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, 
                my child?&quot; said the teacher.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you understand, damn you?&quot; shouted a voice, 
                and Pierre woke up.</p>
              <p> 　　He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed 
                a Russian soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting 
                a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up 
                and his sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly 
                turned the ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was 
                clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all the same to him,&quot; he muttered, turning 
                quickly to a soldier who stood behind him. &quot;Brigand! Get 
                away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who 
                turned away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian 
                soldier the Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire 
                patting something with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized 
                the blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, he's come?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;And Plat-&quot; 
                he began, but did not finish.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his 
                fancy- of the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree, 
                of the shot heard from that spot, of the dog's howl, of the guilty 
                faces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered 
                and smoking gun, and of Karataev's absence at this halt- and he 
                was on the point of realizing that Karataev had been killed, but 
                just at that instant, he knew not why, the recollection came to 
                his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish 
                lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And without linking 
                up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre 
                closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in summertime 
                mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating 
                globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.</p>
              <p> 　　Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid 
                firing. French soldiers were running past him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Cossacks!&quot; one of them shouted, and a moment 
                later a crowd of Russians surrounded Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　For a long time he could not understand what was happening 
                to him. All around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!&quot; old soldiers 
                exclaimed, weeping, as they embraced Cossacks and hussars.</p>
              <p> 　　The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one 
                offered them clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre 
                sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word. He hugged 
                the first soldier who approached him, and kissed him, weeping.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a 
                crowd of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all 
                that had happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as 
                they passed Dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip 
                and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they 
                became silent. On the opposite side stood Dolokhov's Cossack, 
                counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk 
                line on the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How many?&quot; Dolokhov asked the Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The second hundred,&quot; replied the Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Filez, filez!&quot;* Dolokhov kept saying, having adopted 
                this expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of 
                the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Get along, get along!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind 
                some Cossacks who were carrying the body of Petya Rostov to a 
                hole that had been dug in the garden.</p>

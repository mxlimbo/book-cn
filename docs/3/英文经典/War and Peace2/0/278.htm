              <p> 　　When Natasha opened Prince Andrew's door with a familiar movement 
                and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess 
                felt the sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare 
                herself, and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would 
                be unable to look at him without tears.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess understood what Natasha had meant by the words: 
                &quot;two days ago this suddenly happened.&quot; She understood 
                those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this 
                softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death. As she 
                stepped to the door she already saw in imagination Andrew's face 
                as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic 
                face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore affected her 
                very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender words 
                to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and that 
                she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in 
                his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. 
                The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and 
                more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes 
                tried to make out his features, and then she saw his face and 
                met his gaze.</p>
              <p> 　　He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded 
                by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white 
                hand he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the 
                delicate mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His 
                eyes gazed at them as they entered.</p>
              <p> 　　On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary's pace 
                suddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. 
                She suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression 
                of his face and eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But in what am I to blame?&quot; she asked herself. 
                And his cold, stern look replied: &quot;Because you are alive 
                and thinking of the living, while I...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the deep the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards 
                but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly 
                regarded his sister and Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their 
                wont.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?&quot; 
                said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck 
                such horror into Princess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And have you brought little Nicholas?&quot; he asked 
                in the same slow, quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How are you now?&quot; said Princess Mary, herself surprised 
                at what she was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,&quot; he replied, 
                and again making an evident effort to be affectionate, he said 
                with his lips only (his words clearly did not correspond to his 
                thoughts):</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Thank you for coming, my dear.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince 
                just perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to 
                say. She now understood what had happened to him two days before. 
                In his words, his tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic 
                look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to 
                this world, terrible in one who is alive. Evidently only with 
                an effort did he understand anything living; but it was obvious 
                that he failed to understand, not because he lacked the power 
                to do so but because he understood something else- something the 
                living did not and could not understand- and which wholly occupied 
                his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,&quot; 
                said he, breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha. &quot;She 
                looks after me all the time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could 
                say such a thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how 
                could he say that, before her whom he loved and who loved him? 
                Had he expected to live he could not have said those words in 
                that offensively cold tone. If he had not known that he was dying, 
                how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like 
                that in her presence? The only explanation was that he was indifferent, 
                because something else, much more important, had been revealed 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually 
                broke off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary came by way of Ryazan,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, 
                and only after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice 
                it herself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, 
                and that...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that 
                he was making an effort to listen, but could not do so.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, they say it's burned,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
                a great pity,&quot; and he gazed straight before him, absently 
                stroking his mustache with his fingers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?&quot; Prince 
                Andrew suddenly said, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to 
                them. &quot;He wrote here that he took a great liking to you,&quot; 
                he went on simply and calmly, evidently unable to understand all 
                the complex significance his words had for living people. &quot;If 
                you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you to get married,&quot; 
                he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having found words 
                he had long been seeking.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for 
                her, except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything 
                living.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why talk of me?&quot; she said quietly and glanced at 
                Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three 
                were again silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, would you like...&quot; Princess Mary suddenly 
                said in a trembling voice, &quot;would you like to see little 
                Nicholas? He is always talking about you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, 
                but Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror 
                that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, 
                but with quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying 
                what she believed to be the last means of arousing him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew's room 
                he looked at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, 
                because no one else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently 
                did not know what to say to him.</p>
              <p> 　　When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went 
                up to her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears 
                any longer began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked at her attentively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it about Nicholas?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary, you know the Gosp...&quot; but he broke off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What did you say?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing. You mustn't cry here,&quot; he said, looking 
                at her with the same cold expression. </p>
              <p> 　　When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was 
                crying at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without 
                a father. With a great effort he tried to return to life and to 
                see things from their point of view.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, to them it must seem sad!&quot; he thought. &quot;But 
                how simple it is.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, 
                yet your Father feedeth them,&quot; he said to himself and wished 
                to say to Princess Mary; &quot;but no, they will take it their 
                own way, they won't understand! They can't understand that all 
                those feelings they prize so- all our feelings, all those ideas 
                that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand 
                one another,&quot; and he remained silent. </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's little son was seven. He could scarcely read, 
                and knew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, 
                gaining knowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed 
                all the faculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had 
                a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the 
                scene he had witnessed between his father, Mary, and Natasha, 
                than he had then. He understood it completely, and, leaving the 
                room without crying, went silently up to Natasha who had come 
                out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful, thoughtful 
                eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his 
                head against her he began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed 
                him and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or 
                to Natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and 
                clung to them quietly and shyly.</p>
              <p> 　　When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood 
                what Natasha's face had told her. She did not speak any more to 
                Natasha of hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside 
                his sofa, and did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning 
                in soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above 
                the dying man was now so evident.</p>

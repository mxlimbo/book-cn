              <p> 　　In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the 
                commander in chief.</p>
              <p> 　　When he entered the private room Count Rostopchin, puckering 
                his face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short 
                man was saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking 
                and went out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, how do you do, great warrior?&quot; said Rostopchin 
                as soon as the short man had left the room. &quot;We have heard 
                of your prowess. But that's not the point. Between ourselves, 
                mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?&quot; he went on severely, 
                as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless 
                intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. &quot;I am well informed, 
                my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and Masons and 
                I hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving 
                mankind wish to ruin Russia.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I am a Mason,&quot; Pierre replied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. 
                Speranski and Magnitski have been deported to their proper place. 
                Mr. Klyucharev has been treated in the same way, and so have others 
                who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried 
                to destroy the temple of their fatherland. You can understand 
                that there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled 
                the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now come 
                to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal 
                from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him for 
                safe custody. I like you and don't wish you any harm and- as you 
                are only half my age- I advise you, as a father would, to cease 
                all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as 
                soon as possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what did Klyucharev do wrong, Count?&quot; asked 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,&quot; 
                shouted Rostopchin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he is accused of circulating Napoleon's proclamation 
                it is not proved that he did so,&quot; said Pierre without looking 
                at Rostopchin, &quot;and Vereshchagin...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There we are!&quot; Rostopchin shouted at Pierre louder 
                than before, frowning suddenly. &quot;Vereshchagin is a renegade 
                and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves,&quot; said 
                he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling 
                an insult. &quot;But I did not summon you to discuss my actions, 
                but to give you advice- or an order if you prefer it. I beg you 
                to leave the town and break off all communication with such men 
                as Klyucharev. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody&quot;- 
                but probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezukhov who so 
                far was not guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre's hand 
                in a friendly manner, &quot;We are on the eve of a public disaster 
                and I haven't time to be polite to everybody who has business 
                with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what 
                are you doing personally?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, nothing,&quot; answered Pierre without raising 
                his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face.</p>
              <p> 　　The count frowned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon 
                as you can, that's all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears 
                to hear. Good-by, my dear fellow. Oh, by the by!&quot; he shouted 
                through the doorway after Pierre, &quot;is it true that the countess 
                has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the Society 
                of Jesus?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin's room more sullen 
                and angry than he had ever before shown himself.</p>
              <p> 　　When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight 
                people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, 
                the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and 
                various petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted 
                decisions from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested 
                in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get 
                rid of these people. When left alone at last he opened and read 
                his wife's letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... 
                that old man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is 
                necessary... the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife 
                is getting married... One must forget and understand...&quot; 
                And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing 
                and immediately fell asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him 
                that a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count 
                Rostopchin to know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving 
                the town.</p>
              <p> 　　A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting 
                him in the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead 
                of going to see them, went to the back porch and out through the 
                gate.</p>
              <p> 　　From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no 
                one of Bezukhov's household, despite all the search they made, 
                saw Pierre again or knew where he was. </p>

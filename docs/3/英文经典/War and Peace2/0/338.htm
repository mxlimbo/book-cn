              <p> 　　Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history 
                had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. 
                But the mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because 
                the laws of their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.</p>
              <p> 　　Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, 
                the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of 
                time. Various groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming 
                formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples 
                was in course of preparation.</p>
              <p> 　　The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore 
                to shore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic 
                figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another 
                as before. They now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical 
                figures at the head of armies, who formerly reflected the movement 
                of the masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected 
                the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations, 
                laws, and treaties.</p>
              <p> 　　The historians call this activity of the historical figures 
                &quot;the reaction.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical 
                personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as 
                the reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander 
                and Napoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand, 
                and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted 
                or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or 
                to reaction.</p>
              <p> 　　According to their accounts a reaction took place at that 
                time in Russia also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the 
                same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal 
                movement at the commencement of his reign, being the savior of 
                Russia.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy 
                essayist to learned historian, who does not throw his little stone 
                at Alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. 
                In this case he did well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably 
                at the beginning of his reign and during 1812, but acted badly 
                by giving a constitution to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, 
                entrusting power to Arakcheev, favoring Golitsyn and mysticism, 
                and afterwards Shishkov and Photius. He also acted badly by concerning 
                himself with the active army and disbanding the Semenov regiment.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches 
                the historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what 
                is good for humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　What do these reproaches mean?</p>
              <p> 　　Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander 
                I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle 
                with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign 
                of 1813) flow from the same sources- the circumstances of his 
                birth, education, and life- that made his personality what it 
                was and from which the actions for which they blame him (the Holy 
                Alliance, the restoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 
                and later) also flowed?</p>
              <p> 　　In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?</p>
              <p> 　　It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander 
                I, standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with 
                the blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed 
                to those strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, 
                and self-deception inseparable from power; a character who at 
                every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was 
                happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character 
                who like every man had his personal habits, passions, and impulses 
                toward goodness, beauty, and truth- that this character- though 
                not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)- 
                had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years 
                ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has 
                been occupied with learning: that is, with books and lectures 
                and with taking notes from them.</p>
              <p> 　　But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was 
                mistaken in his view of what was good for the people, we must 
                inevitably assume that the historian who judges Alexander will 
                also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his 
                view of what is good for humanity. This assumption is all the 
                more natural and inevitable because, watching the movement of 
                history, we see that every year and with each new writer, opinion 
                as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what once seemed 
                good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is more, 
                we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as 
                to what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard 
                giving a constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance 
                as praiseworthy in Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.</p>
              <p> 　　The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called 
                useful or harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was 
                useful or harmful. If that activity displeases somebody, this 
                is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding 
                of what is good. Whether the preservation of my father's house 
                in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or the prosperity 
                of the Petersburg and other universities, or the freedom of Poland 
                or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in Europe, 
                or a certain kind of European culture called &quot;progress&quot; 
                appear to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these 
                things the action of every historic character has other more general 
                purposes inaccessible to me.</p>
              <p> 　　But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize 
                all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good 
                and bad by which to try historic characters and events; let us 
                say that Alexander could have done everything differently; let 
                us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess 
                to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity, he might 
                have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers 
                would have given him- of nationality, freedom, equality, and progress 
                (these, I think, cover the ground). Let us assume that this program 
                was possible and had then been formulated, and that Alexander 
                had acted on it. What would then have become of the activity of 
                all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the 
                government- an activity that in the opinion of the historians 
                was good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: 
                there would have been no life, there would have been nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility 
                of life is destroyed.</p>

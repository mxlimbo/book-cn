              <p> 　　 History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize 
                and put into words, to describe directly the life of humanity 
                or even of a single nation, appears impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　The ancient historians all employed one and the same method 
                to describe and seize the apparently elusive- the life of a people. 
                They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, 
                and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity 
                of the whole nation.</p>
              <p> 　　The question: how did individuals make nations act as they 
                wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves 
                guided? the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected 
                the nations to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of 
                that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined.</p>
              <p> 　　For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in 
                the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.</p>
              <p> 　　It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients 
                in man's subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward 
                which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations 
                of power but the causes that produce it. But modern history has 
                not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held by the 
                ancients, it still follows them in practice.</p>
              <p> 　　Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly 
                guided by the will of God, modern history has given us either 
                heroes endowed with extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply 
                men of very various kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead 
                the masses. Instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the 
                Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which ancient historians regarded 
                as representing the progress of humanity, modern history has postulated 
                its own aims- the welfare of the French, German, or English people, 
                or, in its highest abstraction, the welfare and civilization of 
                humanity in general, by which is usually meant that of the peoples 
                occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent.</p>
              <p> 　　Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without 
                replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation 
                has obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected 
                the divine authority of the kings and the &quot;fate&quot; of 
                the ancients, to reach the same conclusion by another road, that 
                is, to recognize (1) nations guided by individual men, and (2) 
                the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity 
                at large are tending.</p>
              <p> 　　At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from 
                Gibbon to Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the 
                apparent novelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable 
                assumptions.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first place the historian describes the activity of 
                individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian 
                considers only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such 
                men, while another includes also orators, learned men, reformers, 
                philosophers, and poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the goal 
                toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians: 
                to one of them this goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, 
                or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality, and a certain 
                kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called Europe.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and 
                is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several 
                times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from 
                the east westward. In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, 
                and then, with remarkable symmetry, a countermovement occurs from 
                east to west, attracting to it, as the first movement had done, 
                the nations of middle Europe. The counter movement reaches the 
                starting point of the first movement in the west- Paris- and subsides.</p>
              <p> 　　During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields 
                were left untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, 
                millions of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, 
                and millions of Christian men professing the law of love of their 
                fellows slew one another.</p>
              <p> 　　What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those 
                people burn houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes 
                of these events? What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, 
                plain, and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when 
                it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period.</p>
              <p> 　　For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind 
                turns to the science of history, whose aim is to enable nations 
                and humanity to know themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　If history had retained the conception of the ancients it 
                would have said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave 
                Napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the 
                divine ends, and that reply, would have been clear and complete. 
                One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of 
                Napoleon, but for anyone believing in it there would have been 
                nothing unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would 
                there have been any contradictions.</p>
              <p> 　　But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not 
                admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation 
                of the Deity in human affairs, and therefore history ought to 
                give other answers.</p>
              <p> 　　Modern history replying to these questions says: you want 
                to know what this movement means, what caused it, and what force 
                produced these events? Then listen:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he 
                had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he 
                ruled France badly. His descendants were weak men and they too 
                ruled France badly. And they had such and such favorites and such 
                and such mistresses. Moreover, certain men wrote some books at 
                that time. At the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple 
                of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men being free 
                and equal. This caused people all over France to begin to slash 
                at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other 
                people. At that time there was in France a man of genius- Napoleon. 
                He conquered everybody everywhere- that is, he killed many people 
                because he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to 
                kill Africans, and killed them so well and was so cunning and 
                wise that when he returned to France he ordered everybody to obey 
                him, and they all obeyed him. Having become an Emperor he again 
                went out to kill people in Italy, Austria, and Prussia. And there 
                too he killed a great many. In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, 
                who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought against 
                Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 
                they again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon 
                led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; 
                then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, 
                helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to arm 
                against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon's allies suddenly 
                became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh 
                forces he raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, 
                forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, 
                not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every 
                respect, though five years before and one year later they all 
                regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII, who 
                till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the 
                Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his 
                Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then the 
                skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who 
                managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and 
                thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and 
                by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly 
                the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the 
                point of again ordering their armies to kill one another, but 
                just then Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and the 
                French, who had been hating him, immediately all submitted to 
                him. But the Allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight 
                the French once more. And they defeated the genius Napoleon and, 
                suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him to the island 
                of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved France 
                so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and 
                bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction 
                occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their 
                subjects.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic- a caricature 
                of the historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild 
                expression of the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, 
                which all the historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and 
                the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories 
                and the new histories of the culture of that period.</p>
              <p> 　　The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from 
                the fact that modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions 
                no one has asked.</p>
              <p> 　　If the purpose of history be to give a description of the 
                movement of humanity and of the peoples, the first question- in 
                the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible- 
                is: what is the power that moves peoples? To this, modern history 
                laboriously replies either that Napoleon was a great genius, or 
                that Louis XIV was very proud, or that certain writers wrote certain 
                books.</p>
              <p> 　　All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, 
                but it is not what was asked. All that would be interesting if 
                we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently 
                directing its nations through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; 
                but we do not acknowledge such a power, and therefore before speaking 
                about Napoleons, Louis-es, and authors, we ought to be shown the 
                connection existing between these men and the movement of the 
                nations.</p>
              <p> 　　If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, 
                it should be explained in what this new force consists, for the 
                whole interest of history lies precisely in that force.</p>
              <p> 　　History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and 
                known to everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as 
                known, anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting 
                whether this new force, so variously understood by the historians 
                themselves, is really quite well known to everybody.</p>

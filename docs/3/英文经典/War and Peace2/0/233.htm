              <p> 　　The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon 
                in the better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov's hut. The 
                men, women, and children of the large peasant family crowded into 
                the back room across the passage. Only Malasha, Andrew's six-year-old 
                granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom 
                he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea, remained 
                on the top of the brick oven in the larger room. Malasha looked 
                down from the oven with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and 
                decorations of the generals, who one after another came into the 
                room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the 
                icons. &quot;Granddad&quot; himself, as Malasha in her own mind 
                called Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He 
                sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and continually cleared 
                his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which, though 
                it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those who entered 
                went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the hands 
                of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysarov was about 
                to draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutuzov, but the 
                latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood that his 
                Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Round the peasant's deal table, on which lay maps, plans, 
                pencils, and papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies 
                brought in another bench and put it beside the table. Ermolov, 
                Kaysarov, and Toll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench. 
                In the foremost place, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay 
                de Tolly, his high forehead merging into his bald crown. He had 
                a St. George's Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill. He 
                had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain. 
                Beside him sat Uvarov, who with rapid gesticulations was giving 
                him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did. Chubby 
                little Dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised 
                and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, 
                seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad head with its 
                bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand. Raevski, 
                twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit, 
                glanced now at Kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatience. 
                Konovnitsyn's firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by a 
                tender, sly smile. His glance met Malasha's, and the expression 
                of his eyes caused the little girl to smile.</p>
              <p> 　　They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of 
                inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They 
                waited for him from four till six o'clock and did not begin their 
                deliberations all that time talked in low tones of other matters.</p>
              <p> 　　Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave 
                his corner and draw toward the table, but not near enough for 
                the candles that had been placed there to light up his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Bennigsen opened the council with the question: &quot;Are 
                we to abandon Russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, 
                or are we to defend it?&quot; A prolonged and general silence 
                followed. There was a frown on every face and only Kutuzov's angry 
                grunts and occasional cough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing 
                at him. Malasha too looked at &quot;Granddad.&quot; She was nearest 
                to him and saw how his face puckered; he seemed about to cry, 
                but this did not last long.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Russia's ancient and sacred capital!&quot; he suddenly 
                said, repeating Bennigsen's words in an angry voice and thereby 
                drawing attention to the false note in them. &quot;Allow me to 
                tell you, your excellency, that that question has no meaning for 
                a Russian.&quot; (He lurched his heavy body forward.) &quot;Such 
                a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question I have 
                asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one. The 
                question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow 
                without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army 
                as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,&quot; 
                and he sank back in his chair.</p>
              <p> 　　The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game 
                lost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive 
                battle at Fili was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism 
                and the love of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right 
                to the left flank during the night and attack the French right 
                flank the following day. Opinions were divided, and arguments 
                were advanced for and against that project. Ermolov, Dokhturov, 
                and Raevski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary 
                to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by 
                other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not to understand 
                that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events 
                and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, 
                however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, 
                of the direction the army should take in its retreat. Malasha, 
                who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood 
                the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that 
                it was only a personal struggle between &quot;Granddad&quot; and 
                &quot;Long-coat&quot; as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they 
                grew spiteful when they spoke to one another, and in her heart 
                she sided with &quot;Granddad.&quot; In the midst of the conversation 
                she noticed &quot;Granddad&quot; give Bennigsen a quick, subtle 
                glance, and then to her joys he saw that &quot;Granddad&quot; 
                said something to &quot;Long-coat&quot; which settled him. Bennigsen 
                suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What 
                so affected him was Kutuzov's calm and quiet comment on the advantage 
                or disadvantage of Bennigsen's proposal to move troops by night 
                from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Kutuzov, &quot;I cannot approve 
                of the count's plan. Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy 
                is always dangerous, and military history supports that view. 
                For instance...&quot; Kutuzov seemed to reflect, searching for 
                an example, then with a clear, naive look at Bennigsen he added: 
                &quot;Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the 
                count well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only 
                because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to 
                them all.</p>
              <p> 　　The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred 
                and they all felt that there was no more to be said.</p>
              <p> 　　During one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if 
                preparing to speak. They all looked at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to 
                pay for the broken crockery,&quot; said he, and rising slowly 
                he moved to the table. &quot;Gentlemen, I have heard your views. 
                Some of you will not agree with me. But I,&quot; he paused, &quot;by 
                the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country, order 
                a retreat.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity 
                and circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different 
                from the way they had spoken during the council, communicated 
                something to their commander in chief.</p>
              <p> 　　Malasha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully 
                backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at 
                its projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals 
                she darted out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time 
                with his elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible 
                question: &quot;When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become 
                inevitable? When was that done which settled the matter? And who 
                was to blame for it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did not expect this,&quot; said he to his adjutant 
                Schneider when the latter came in late that night. &quot;I did 
                not expect this! I did not think this would happen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,&quot; 
                replied Schneider.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!&quot; 
                exclaimed Kutuzov without replying, striking the table with his 
                podgy fist. &quot;They shall too, if only...&quot; </p>

              <p> 　　Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist 
                going to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the 
                homage he received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and 
                yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning, and could 
                not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and 
                then of Balashev.</p>
              <p> 　　Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to 
                be personally insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the 
                army in the best way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and 
                earn fame as a great commander. Rostov charged the French because 
                he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; 
                and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the 
                war acted in accord with their personal characteristics, habits, 
                circumstances, and aims. They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced 
                or were indignant, reasoned, imagining that they knew what they 
                were doing and did it of their own free will, but they all were 
                involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work concealed from 
                them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of 
                men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy 
                the less are they free.</p>
              <p> 　　The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal 
                interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains 
                of that time but its historic results.</p>
              <p> 　　Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal 
                aims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no 
                one of them at all expected- neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, 
                nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting.</p>
              <p> 　　The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is 
                clear to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the 
                one hand, its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season 
                without any preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, 
                the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns 
                and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people. 
                But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that 
                this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men- the 
                best in the world and led by the best general- could be destroyed 
                in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and 
                led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only 
                did no one see this, but on the Russian side every effort was 
                made to hinder the only thing that could save Russia, while on 
                the French side, despite Napoleon's experience and so-called military 
                genius, every effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the 
                end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing that was bound 
                to lead to destruction.</p>
              <p> 　　In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very 
                fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his 
                line, that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him 
                to stop at Smolensk, and of making similar statements to show 
                that the danger of the campaign was even then understood. Russian 
                authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement 
                of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure Napoleon 
                into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute 
                to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others 
                again to Alexander himself- pointing to notes, projects, and letters 
                which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these hints 
                at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are 
                advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event 
                not occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have 
                forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations 
                to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten 
                because the event falsified them. There are always so many conjectures 
                as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will 
                always be people to say: &quot;I said then that it <br>
                would be so,&quot; quite forgetting that amid their innumerable 
                conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.</p>
              <p> 　　Conjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending 
                his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into 
                the depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by 
                much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon 
                and his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All 
                the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During 
                the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the 
                Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, 
                but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to 
                stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his 
                line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did 
                not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.</p>
              <p> 　　At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, 
                and our sole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies 
                was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into 
                the depths of the country. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage 
                it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The 
                enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel's plan, and there was 
                no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders 
                in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the idea 
                of letting the enemy even reach Smolensk, still less could he 
                contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite 
                he was displeased that Smolensk was abandoned and burned without 
                a general engagement having been fought under its walls.</p>
              <p> 　　So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people 
                were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating 
                into the depths of the country.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the 
                country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In 
                August he was at Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther, 
                though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger 
                of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders 
                then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The 
                luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the 
                result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it 
                resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and 
                wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception 
                whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia. 
                Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at 
                the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with 
                the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy's 
                advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle 
                with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies 
                at an acute angle- we led the French on to Smolensk. But we withdrew 
                at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between 
                our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew 
                still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner 
                disliked by Bagration (who would come his command), and Bagration- 
                being in command of the second army- tried to postpone joining 
                up and coming under Barclay's command as long as he could. Bagration 
                was slow in effecting the junction- though that was the chief 
                aim of all at headquarters- because, as he alleged, he exposed 
                his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to retire 
                more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from 
                flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his 
                army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come 
                under the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank 
                was inferior to his own.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence 
                and ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of 
                advisers and plans, destroyed the first army's energy and it retired.</p>
              <p> 　　The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but 
                Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly 
                employed his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel's whole 
                plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as 
                Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited. The 
                armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and Barclay 
                was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the unpopularity 
                of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand 
                indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have 
                refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, 
                instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing 
                indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic 
                zeal.</p>
              <p> 　　At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient 
                and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that 
                it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals 
                and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this 
                visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army 
                was trebled.</p>
              <p> 　　He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief's 
                undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action 
                would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still 
                more confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm 
                of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander 
                in chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, 
                feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these 
                &quot;eyes of the Emperor,&quot; became still more cautious of 
                undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.</p>
              <p> 　　Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarevich hinted at treachery 
                and demanded a general engagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, 
                and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, 
                under pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these 
                Polish adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open 
                struggle with Bennigsen and the Tsarevich.</p>
              <p> 　　At Smolensk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagration 
                disliked it.</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration drove up in a carriage to to the house occupied 
                by Barclay. Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report 
                to his senior officer Bagration.</p>
              <p> 　　Despite his seniority in rank Bagration, in this contest of 
                magnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, 
                agreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor's orders Bagration 
                reported direct to him. He wrote to Arakcheev, the Emperor's confidant: 
                &quot;It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with 
                the Minister (meaning Barclay). For God's sake send me somewhere 
                else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here. 
                Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist 
                and there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving 
                my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving 
                Barclay. I confess I do not want to.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like 
                still further embittered the relations between the commanders 
                in chief, and even less unity resulted. Preparations were made 
                to fight the French before Smolensk. A general was sent to survey 
                the position. This general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend 
                of his own, a corps commander, and, having spent the day with 
                him, returned to Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every 
                point of view, the battleground he had not seen.</p>
              <p> 　　While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future 
                field of battle, and while we were looking for the French- having 
                lost touch with them- the French stumbled upon Neverovski's division 
                and reached the walls of Smolensk.</p>
              <p> 　　It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk 
                to save our lines of communication. The battle was fought and 
                thousands were killed on both sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor 
                and of the whole people. But Smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants-who 
                had been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, 
                setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking 
                only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon 
                advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very result 
                which caused his destruction.</p>

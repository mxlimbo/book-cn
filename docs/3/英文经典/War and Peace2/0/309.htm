              <p> 　　The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, 
                tightened their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denisov stood 
                by the watchman's hut giving final orders. The infantry of the 
                detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid 
                the trees in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing 
                through the mud. The esaul gave some orders to his men. Petya 
                held his horse by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to 
                mount. His face, having been bathed in cold water, was all aglow, 
                and his eyes were particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down 
                his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, is ev'wything weady?&quot; asked Denisov. &quot;Bwing 
                the horses.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The horses were brought. Denisov was angry with the Cossack 
                because the saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. 
                Petya put his foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as 
                if to nip his leg, but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious 
                of his own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting 
                in the darkness behind him, rode up to Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... 
                for God's sake...!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya's very existence. He 
                turned to glance at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I ask one thing of you,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;to 
                obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all 
                the way. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably 
                growing light over the field. Denisov talked in whispers with 
                the esaul and the Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they 
                had all ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode down the 
                hill. Slipping onto their haunches and sliding, the horses descended 
                with their riders into the ravine. Petya rode beside Denisov, 
                the pulsation of his body constantly increasing. It was getting 
                lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid distant objects. Having 
                reached the valley, Denisov looked back and nodded to a Cossack 
                beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The signal!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant 
                the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from 
                various sides, and then more shots.</p>
              <p> 　　At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya 
                lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not 
                heeding Denisov who shouted at him. It seemed to Petya that at 
                the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as 
                noon. He galloped to the bridge. Cossacks were galloping along 
                the road in front of him. On the bridge he collided with a Cossack 
                who had fallen behind, but he galloped on. In front of him soldiers, 
                probably Frenchmen, were running from right to left across the 
                road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse's feet.</p>
              <p> 　　Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From 
                the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose. Petya galloped 
                up, and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling 
                jaw of a Frenchman, clutching the handle of a lance that had been 
                aimed at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!&quot; shouted Petya, and giving 
                rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village 
                street.</p>
              <p> 　　He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and 
                ragged Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides 
                of the road, were shouting something loudly and incoherently. 
                A gallant-looking Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and 
                with a frowning red face, had been defending himself against the 
                hussars. When Petya galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen. 
                &quot;Too late again!&quot; flashed through Petya's mind and he 
                galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be 
                heard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner's house he 
                had visited the night before with Dolokhov. The French were making 
                a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown 
                with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the 
                gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, Petya saw 
                Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to 
                his men. &quot;Go round! Wait for the infantry!&quot; he exclaimed 
                as Petya rode up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!&quot; shouted Petya, and without 
                pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds 
                of firing and where the smoke was thickest.</p>
              <p> 　　A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while 
                others plashed against something. The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped 
                after Petya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering 
                smoke some of the French threw down their arms and ran out of 
                the bushes to meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill 
                toward the pond. Petya was galloping along the courtyard, but 
                instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly 
                and strangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in his 
                saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering 
                in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily 
                on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs 
                jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet 
                had pierced his skull.</p>
              <p> 　　After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out 
                of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced 
                that they surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, 
                who lay motionless with outstretched arms.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Done for!&quot; he said with a frown, and went to the 
                gate to meet Denisov who was riding toward him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Killed?&quot; cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance 
                the unmistakably lifeless attitude- very familiar to him- in which 
                Petya's body was lying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Done for!&quot; repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance 
                of these words afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to 
                the prisoners, who were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried 
                up. &quot;We won't take them!&quot; he called out to Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and 
                with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered 
                face which had already gone white.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... 
                take them all!&quot; he recalled Petya's words. And the Cossacks 
                looked round in surprise at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, 
                with which Denisov turned away, walked to the wattle fence, and 
                seized hold of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denisov and Dolokhov 
                was Pierre Bezukhov. </p>

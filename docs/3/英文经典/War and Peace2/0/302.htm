              <p> 　　It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were 
                both the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, 
                and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the 
                rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken 
                sides. Like his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears 
                back, he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before 
                him. His thin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry.</p>
              <p> 　　Beside Denisov rode an esaul,* Denisov's fellow worker, also 
                in felt cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don 
                horse. </p>
              <p> 　　*A captain of Cossacks. </p>
              <p> 　　Esaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an 
                arrow, pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with 
                calm self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was 
                impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider 
                lay, yet at first glance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that 
                the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on 
                a horse, while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable 
                and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had 
                mounted a horse, but a man who was one with his horse, a being 
                consequently possessed of twofold strength.</p>
              <p> 　　A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the 
                skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.</p>
              <p> 　　A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with 
                an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer 
                in a blue French overcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French 
                uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The 
                boy held on to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his 
                eyebrows gazed about him with surprise. This was the French drummer 
                boy captured that morning.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came 
                hussars in threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, 
                some in French greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their 
                heads. The horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black 
                whether chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging 
                manes, looked strangely thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, 
                reins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the ground and 
                the fallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled up 
                trying not to stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled 
                to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking 
                in under their seats, their knees, and at the back of their necks. 
                In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn 
                by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched 
                on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed 
                through the water that lay in the ruts.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track 
                and bumped his rider's knee against a tree.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, the devil!&quot; exclaimed Denisov angrily, and 
                showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip, 
                splashing himself and his comrades with mud.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also 
                from hunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and 
                yet more because he still had no news from Dolokhov and the man 
                sent to capture a &quot;tongue&quot; had not returned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a 
                transport as today. It's too risky to attack them by oneself, 
                and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla 
                detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses,&quot; thought 
                Denisov, continually peering forward, hoping to see a messenger 
                from Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see 
                far to the right, Denisov stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's someone coming,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　The esaul looked in the direction Denisov indicated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not 
                presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,&quot; 
                said the esaul, who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not 
                know.</p>
              <p> 　　The approaching riders having descended a decline were no 
                longer visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, 
                at a weary gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, 
                disheveled and drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above 
                his knees. Behind him, standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. 
                The officer, a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen 
                merry eyes, galloped up to Denisov and handed him a sodden envelope.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From the general,&quot; said the officer. &quot;Please 
                excuse its not being quite dry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, it's dangerous,'&quot; 
                said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading 
                the dispatch. &quot;But Komarov and I&quot;- he pointed to the 
                Cossack- &quot;were prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... 
                But what's this?&quot; he asked, noticing the French drummer boy. 
                &quot;A prisoner? You've already been in action? May I speak to 
                him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wostov! Petya!&quot; exclaimed Denisov, having run through 
                the dispatch. &quot;Why didn't you say who you were?&quot; and 
                turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer was Petya Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　All the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with 
                Denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer- without hinting 
                at their previous acquaintance. But as soon as Denisov smiled 
                at him Petya brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the 
                official manner he had been rehearsing, and began telling him 
                how he had already been in a battle near Vyazma and how a certain 
                hussar had distinguished himself there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I am glad to see you,&quot; Denisov interrupted 
                him, and his face again assumed its anxious expression.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Michael Feoklitych,&quot; said he to the esaul, &quot;this 
                is again fwom that German, you know. He&quot;- he indicated Petya- 
                &quot;is serving under him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered 
                was a repetition of the German general's demand that he should 
                join forces with him for an attack on the transport.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch it fwom under 
                our noses,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　While Denisov was talking to the esaul, Petya- abashed by 
                Denisov's cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition 
                of his trousers- furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat 
                so that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial 
                an air as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will there be any orders, your honor?&quot; he asked 
                Denisov, holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game 
                of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself, &quot;or 
                shall I remain with your honor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Orders?&quot; Denisov repeated thoughtfully. &quot;But 
                can you stay till tomowwow?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, please... May I stay with you?&quot; cried Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at 
                once?&quot; asked Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya blushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He gave me no instructions. I think I could?&quot; he 
                returned, inquiringly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, all wight,&quot; said Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the 
                halting place arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest, 
                and told the officer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties 
                of an adjutant) to go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether 
                he would come that evening. Denisov himself intended going with 
                the esaul and Petya to the edge of the forest where it reached 
                out to Shamshevo, to have a look at the part of the French bivouac 
                they were to attack next day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, old fellow,&quot; said he to the peasant guide, 
                &quot;lead us to Shamshevo.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks 
                and the hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a 
                ravine to the edge of the forest. </p>

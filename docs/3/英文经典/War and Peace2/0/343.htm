              <p> 　　At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From 
                reports current in town she learned how the Rostovs were situated, 
                and how &quot;the son has sacrificed himself for his mother,&quot; 
                as people were saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I never expected anything else of him,&quot; said Princess 
                Mary to herself, feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering 
                her friendly relations with all the Rostovs which had made her 
                almost a member of the family, she thought it her duty to go to 
                see them. But remembering her relations with Nicholas in Voronezh 
                she was shy about doing so. Making a great effort she did however 
                go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room 
                could only be reached through his. But instead of being greeted 
                with pleasure as she had expected, at his first glance at her 
                his face assumed a cold, stiff, proud expression she had not seen 
                on it before. He inquired about her health, led the way to his 
                mother, and having sat there for five minutes left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　When the princess came out of the countess' room Nicholas 
                met her again, and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied 
                her to the anteroom. To her remarks about his mother's health 
                he made no reply. &quot;What's that to you? Leave me in peace,&quot; 
                his looks seemed to say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? 
                I can't bear these ladies and all these civilities!&quot; said 
                he aloud in Sonya's presence, evidently unable to repress his 
                vexation, after the princess' carriage had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?&quot; cried 
                Sonya, hardly able to conceal her delight. &quot;She is so kind 
                and Mamma is so fond of her!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the 
                princess any more. But after her visit the old countess spoke 
                of her several times a day.</p>
              <p> 　　She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, 
                expressed a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored 
                when she began to talk about her.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the 
                princess, but his silence irritated her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,&quot; 
                said she, &quot;and you must go and call on her. You would at 
                least be seeing somebody, and I think it must be dull for you 
                only seeing us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I don't in the least want to, Mamma.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You used to want to, and now you don't. Really I don't 
                understand you, my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you 
                refuse to see anyone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I never said I was dull.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, you said yourself you don't want even to see her. 
                She is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her, 
                but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head. 
                You hide everything from me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not at all, Mamma.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now- 
                but I only ask you to return a call. One would think mere politeness 
                required it.... Well, I have asked you, and now I won't interfere 
                any more since you have secrets from your mother.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, I'll go if you wish it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards 
                for a patience, trying to divert his mother's attention to another 
                topic.</p>
              <p> 　　The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, 
                and the day after that.</p>
              <p> 　　After her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly 
                reception by Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that 
                she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I expected nothing else,&quot; she told herself, calling 
                her pride to her aid. &quot;I have nothing to do with him and 
                I only wanted to see the old lady, who was always kind to me and 
                to whom I am under many obligations.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a 
                feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. 
                Though she had firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again 
                and to forget the whole matter, she felt herself all the time 
                in an awkward position. And when she asked herself what distressed 
                her, she had to admit that it was her relation to Rostov. His 
                cold, polite manner did not express his feeling for her (she knew 
                that) but it concealed something, and until she could discover 
                what that something was, she felt that she could not be at ease.</p>
              <p> 　　One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending 
                to her nephew's lessons, she was informed that Rostov had called. 
                With a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her 
                agitation, she sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her 
                to the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　Her first glance at Nicholas' face told her that he had only 
                come to fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved 
                to maintain the tone in which he addressed her.</p>
              <p> 　　They spoke of the countess' health, of their mutual friends, 
                of the latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety 
                had elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to 
                say good-by.</p>
              <p> 　　With Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the princess had maintained 
                the conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just 
                when he rose, she was so tired of talking of what did not interest 
                her, and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was 
                granted so little happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness 
                she sat still, her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not 
                noticing that he had risen.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice 
                her abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and 
                then again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with 
                a look of suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry 
                for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of 
                the sadness her face expressed. He wished to help her and say 
                something pleasant, but could think of nothing to say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, Princess!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon,&quot; she said as if waking up. 
                &quot;Are you going already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but 
                the cushion for the countess!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait a moment, I'll fetch it,&quot; said Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, and she left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Princess,&quot; said Nicholas at last with a sad 
                smile, &quot;it doesn't seem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo, 
                but how much water has flowed since then! In what distress we 
                all seemed to be then, yet I would give much to bring back that 
                time... but there's no bringing it back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous 
                ones as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden 
                meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said she, &quot;but you have no reason 
                to regret the past, Count. As I understand your present life, 
                I think you will always recall it with satisfaction, because the 
                self-sacrifice that fills it now...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot accept your praise,&quot; he interrupted her 
                hurriedly. &quot;On the contrary I continually reproach myself.... 
                But this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. 
                But the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known 
                and loved, and it was to him that she now spoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I thought you would allow me to tell you this,&quot; 
                she said. &quot;I had come so near to you... and to all your family 
                that I thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced, but 
                I was mistaken,&quot; and suddenly her voice trembled. &quot;I 
                don't know why,&quot; she continued, recovering herself, &quot;but 
                you used to be different, and...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are a thousand reasons why,&quot; laying special 
                emphasis on the why. &quot;Thank you, Princess,&quot; he added 
                softly. &quot;Sometimes it is hard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So that's why! That's why!&quot; a voice whispered in 
                Princess Mary's soul. &quot;No, it was not only that gay, kind, 
                and frank look, not only that handsome exterior, that I loved 
                in him. I divined his noble, resolute, self-sacrificing spirit 
                too,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Yes, he is poor now and 
                I am rich.... Yes, that's the only reason.... Yes, were it not 
                for that...&quot; And remembering his former tenderness, and looking 
                now at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause 
                of his coldness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why, Count, why?&quot; she almost cried, unconsciously 
                moving closer to him. &quot;Why? Tell me. You must tell me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand your why, Count,&quot; she continued, 
                &quot;but it's hard for me... I confess it. For some reason you 
                wish to deprive me of our former friendship. And that hurts me.&quot; 
                There were tears in her eyes and in her voice. &quot;I have had 
                so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to 
                bear.... Excuse me, good-by!&quot; and suddenly she began to cry 
                and was hurrying from the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess, for God's sake!&quot; he exclaimed, trying 
                to stop her. &quot;Princess!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into 
                one another's eyes- and what had seemed impossible and remote 
                suddenly became possible, inevitable, and very near. </p>

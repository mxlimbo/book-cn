              <p> 　　The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead 
                and wounded, together with the heaviness of his head and the news 
                that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or 
                wounded, and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty 
                arm, produced an unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually 
                liked to look at the killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, 
                testing his strength of mind. This day the horrible appearance 
                of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought 
                constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from 
                the battlefield and returned to the Shevardino knoll, where he 
                sat on his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes 
                dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, 
                with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection 
                he awaited the end of this action, in which he regarded himself 
                as a participant and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, 
                human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial 
                phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own person 
                the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield. 
                The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility 
                of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not 
                desire Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any 
                more glory?). The one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, 
                and freedom. But when he had been on the Semenovsk heights the 
                artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries 
                of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the 
                Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon had assented 
                and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the 
                effect those batteries produced.</p>
              <p> 　　An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred 
                guns had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, 
                but that they still held their ground.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they 
                hold on,&quot; said the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They want more!...&quot; said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire?&quot; asked the adjutant who had not heard the 
                remark.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They want more!&quot; croaked Napoleon frowning. &quot;Let 
                them have it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, 
                and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was 
                expected of him, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial 
                realm of imaginary greatness, and again- as a horse walking a 
                treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself- he submissively 
                fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined 
                for him.</p>
              <p> 　　And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience 
                darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening 
                lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to 
                the end of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, 
                or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to 
                goodness and truth, too remote from everything human, for him 
                ever to be able to grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his 
                actions, belauded as they were by half the world, and so he had 
                to repudiate truth, goodness, and all humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn 
                with men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he 
                reckon as he looked at them how many Russians there were for each 
                Frenchman and, deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in 
                the calculation that there were five Russians for every Frenchman. 
                Not on that day alone did he write in a letter to Paris that &quot;the 
                battle field was superb,&quot; because fifty thousand corpses 
                lay there, but even on the island of St. Helena in the peaceful 
                solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an 
                account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote: </p>
              <p> 　　The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern 
                times: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the 
                tranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and 
                the beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening 
                out, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system 
                was already founded; all that remained was to organize it.</p>
              <p> 　　Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, 
                I too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those 
                ideas were stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns 
                we should have discussed our interests like one family, and have 
                rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master.</p>
              <p> 　　Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one 
                people, and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself 
                always in the common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom 
                of all navigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be 
                common to all, and that the great standing armies should be reduced 
                henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns.</p>
              <p> 　　On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, 
                magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have 
                proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, 
                all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son 
                in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his 
                constitutional reign would have begun.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French 
                the envy of the nations!</p>
              <p> 　　My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, 
                in company with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship 
                of my son, to leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like 
                a true country couple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, 
                redressing wrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions 
                on all sides and everywhere. </p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of 
                executioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his 
                actions had been the peoples' welfare and that he could control 
                the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,&quot; 
                he wrote further of the Russian war, &quot;half were Austrians, 
                Prussians, Saxons, Poles, Bavarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, 
                Spaniards, Italians, and Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly 
                speaking, was one third composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from 
                the borders of the Rhine, Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, 
                Romans, inhabitants of the Thirty-second Military Division, of 
                Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it included scarcely a hundred 
                and forty thousand who spoke French. The Russian expedition actually 
                cost France less than fifty thousand men; the Russian army in 
                its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in the various battles four 
                times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow cost 
                the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and 
                want in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder 
                the Russian army also suffered from the severity of the season; 
                so that by the the time it reached Vilna it numbered only fifty 
                thousand, and at Kalisch less than eighteen thousand.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, 
                and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly 
                took the whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened 
                mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds 
                of thousands who perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians 
                and Bavarians. </p>

              <p> 　　On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozhaysk. 
                At the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road 
                led out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service 
                was being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his 
                vehicle and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was 
                coming down the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward 
                him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in 
                the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers, shouting and 
                lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The carts, 
                in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or 
                sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep 
                incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged 
                with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, 
                held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against 
                one another. Almost all of them stared with naive, childlike curiosity 
                at Pierre's white hat and green swallow-tail coat.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded 
                to keep to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended 
                the hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre's carriage and blocked 
                the road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the 
                cutting in which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill 
                did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, 
                but above Pierre's head was the bright August sunshine and the 
                bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by 
                the side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes 
                ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless 
                hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his little 
                horse.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who 
                was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound 
                hand and turned to look at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here 
                or take us on to Moscow?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. 
                He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy 
                of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which 
                two wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting 
                up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole 
                head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size 
                of a baby's head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. 
                This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself. 
                Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as though 
                there was no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, 
                with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his face was not 
                visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 Living in a foreign land. they sang their soldiers' dance 
                song.</p>
              <p> 　　As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, 
                the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the 
                hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with 
                yet another sort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart 
                with the wounded near the panting little nag where Pierre stood, 
                it was damp, somber, and sad.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry 
                singers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, the coxcombs!&quot; he muttered reproachfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not the soldiers only, but I've seen peasants today, 
                too.... The peasants- even they have to go,&quot; said the soldier 
                behind the cart, addressing Pierre with a sad smile. &quot;No 
                distinctions made nowadays.... They want the whole nation to fall 
                on them- in a word, it's Moscow! They want to make an end of it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words Pierre understood 
                what he wanted to say and nodded approval.</p>
              <p> 　　The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove 
                on.</p>
              <p> 　　He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, 
                but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military 
                men of different branches of the service, who all looked with 
                astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat.</p>
              <p> 　　Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance 
                and eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. 
                He was driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside 
                a young surgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack 
                who occupied the driver's seat to pull up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?&quot; 
                asked the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you know, I wanted to see...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, there will be something to see....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention 
                of taking part in a battle.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during 
                the battle?&quot; he said, exchanging glances with his young companion. 
                &quot;Anyhow his Serene Highness knows you and will receive you 
                graciously. That's what you must do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where 
                our position is exactly?&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The position?&quot; repeated the doctor. &quot;Well, 
                that's not my line. Drive past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is 
                going on there. Go up the hillock and you'll see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can one see from there?... If you would...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I would go with you but on my honor I'm up to here&quot;- 
                and he pointed to his throat. &quot;I'm galloping to the commander 
                of the corps. How do matters stand?... You know, Count, there'll 
                be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army of a hundred thousand we 
                must expect at least twenty thousand wounded, and we haven't stretchers, 
                or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for six thousand. We 
                have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as well- we 
                must manage as best we can!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and 
                old, who had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the 
                very men he had noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed 
                to wounds and death amazed Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything 
                but death?&quot; And by some latent sequence of thought the descent 
                of the Mozhaysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing 
                bells, the slanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen 
                vividly recurred to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and 
                do not for a moment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking 
                at the wounded. Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed 
                to die, and they wonder at my hat! Strange!&quot; thought Pierre, 
                continuing his way to Tatarinova.</p>
              <p> 　　In front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood 
                carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The 
                commander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre 
                arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there- 
                they had gone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward Gorki.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village 
                street, he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their 
                white shirts and with crosses on their caps, who, talking and 
                laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, were at work on a huge 
                knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads 
                of earth along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. 
                On seeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the 
                novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought 
                of the wounded men at Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier 
                had meant when he said: &quot;They want the whole nation to fall 
                on them.&quot; The sight of these bearded peasants at work on 
                the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots and perspiring 
                necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle, 
                unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed Pierre 
                more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment 
                than anything he had yet seen or heard.</p>

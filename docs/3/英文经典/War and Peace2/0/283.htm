              <p> 　　Bennigsen's note and the Cossack's information that the left 
                flank of the French was unguarded were merely final indications 
                that it was necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for 
                the fifth of October.</p>
              <p> 　　On the morning of the fourth of October Kutuzov signed the 
                dispositions. Toll read them to Ermolov, asking him to attend 
                to the further arrangements.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right- all right. I haven't time just now,&quot; 
                replied Ermolov, and left the hut.</p>
              <p> 　　The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the 
                Austerlitz dispositions, it was written- though not in German 
                this time:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The First Column will march here and here,&quot; &quot;the 
                Second Column will march there and there,&quot; and so on; and 
                on paper, all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed 
                time and destroyed the enemy. Everything had been admirably thought 
                out as is usual in dispositions, and as is always the case, not 
                a single column reached its place at the appointed time.</p>
              <p> 　　When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had 
                been prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them 
                to Ermolov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, 
                Kutuzov's orderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted 
                to him, went to Ermolov's quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gone away,&quot; said Ermolov's orderly.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom 
                Ermolov was often to be found.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, and the general's out too.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he's gone out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If only they don't make me responsible for this delay! 
                What a nuisance it is!&quot; thought the officer, and he rode 
                round the whole camp. One man said he had seen Ermolov ride past 
                with some other generals, others said he must have returned home. 
                The officer searched till six o'clock in the evening without even 
                stopping to eat. Ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew 
                where he was. The officer snatched a little food at a comrade's, 
                and rode again to the vanguard to find Miloradovich. Miloradovich 
                too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a ball 
                at General Kikin's and that Ermolov was probably there too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But where is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, there, over at Echkino,&quot; said a Cossack officer, 
                pointing to a country house in the far distance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What, outside our line?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They've put two regiments as outposts, and they're having 
                such a spree there, it's awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino. While still 
                at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's 
                dance song proceeding from the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the meadows... in the meadows!&quot; he heard, accompanied 
                by whistling and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and 
                then by shouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but at the 
                same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having 
                executed sooner the important order entrusted to him. It was already 
                past eight o'clock. He dismounted and went up into the porch of 
                a large country house which had remained intact between the Russian 
                and French forces. In the refreshment room and the hall, footmen 
                were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups of singers stood 
                outside the windows. The officer was admitted and immediately 
                saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among them 
                Ermolov's big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned 
                and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces, 
                laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general 
                with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at 
                such a moment he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred 
                to wait; but one of the generals espied him and, hearing what 
                he had come about, informed Ermolov.</p>
              <p> 　　Ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing 
                what the officer had to say, took the papers from him without 
                a word. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You think he went off just by chance?&quot; said a comrade, 
                who was on the staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse 
                Guards, referring to Ermolov. &quot;It was a trick. It was done 
                on purpose to get Konovnitsyn into trouble. You'll see what a 
                mess there'll be tomorrow.&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved 
                to Bald Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts 
                without selling any of his wife's property, and having received 
                a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt 
                to Pierre as well.</p>
              <p> 　　In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs 
                that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and 
                was negotiating to buy back Otradnoe- that being his pet dream.</p>
              <p> 　　Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted 
                to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. 
                Nicholas was a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially 
                the English ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical 
                treatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising 
                of expensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, 
                and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on 
                his estate. He always had before his mind's eye the estate as 
                a whole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in 
                his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the 
                air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important agent 
                by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective- 
                the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming and began 
                to understand its different branches, it was the serf who especially 
                attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely 
                a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At 
                first he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and 
                what they considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct 
                them and give orders while in reality learning from them their 
                methods, their manner of speech, and their judgment of what was 
                good and bad. Only when he had understood the peasants' tastes 
                and aspirations, had learned to talk their language, to grasp 
                the hidden meaning of their words, and felt akin to them did he 
                begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to perform toward them 
                the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas' management produced 
                very brilliant results.</p>
              <p> 　　Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management 
                of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village 
                elder, and delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have 
                chosen had they had the right to choose, and these posts never 
                changed hands. Before analyzing the properties of manure, before 
                entering into the debit and credit (as he ironically called it), 
                he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the 
                number by all possible means. He kept the peasant families together 
                in the largest groups possible, not allowing the family groups 
                to divide into separate households. He was hard alike on the lazy, 
                the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled from 
                the commune.</p>
              <p> 　　He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' 
                hay and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops 
                sown and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, 
                as did Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs- 
                the &quot;drones&quot; as he called them- and everyone said he 
                spoiled them by his laxity. When a decision had to be taken regarding 
                a domestic serf, especially if one had to be punished, he always 
                felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house; but when 
                it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of 
                a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He never 
                felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that 
                his every decision would be approved by them all with very few 
                exceptions.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a 
                man, or to make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because 
                he felt inclined to do so. He could not have said by what standard 
                he judged what he should or should not do, but the standard was 
                quite firm and definite in his own mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, 
                he would say: &quot;What can one do with our Russian peasants?&quot; 
                and imagined that he could not bear them.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet he loved &quot;our Russian peasants&quot; and their way 
                of life with his whole soul, and for that very reason had understood 
                and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced 
                good results.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband's 
                and regretted that she could not share it; but she could not understand 
                the joys and vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote 
                and alien. She could not understand why he was so particularly 
                animated and happy when, after getting up at daybreak and spending 
                the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor, he 
                returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with 
                her. She did not understand why he spoke with such admiration 
                and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant 
                Matthew Ermishin, who with his family had carted corn all night; 
                or of the fact that his (Nicholas') sheaves were already stacked 
                before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand 
                why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under 
                his mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began 
                to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why 
                when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay 
                harvest he would return from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and 
                perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and, 
                gleefully rubbing his hands, would say: &quot;Well, one more day 
                and my grain and the peasants' will all be under cover.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always 
                ready to anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate 
                when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women 
                who had appealed to her to be excused some work; why he, that 
                kind Nicholas, should obstinately refuse her, angrily asking her 
                not to interfere in what was not her business. She felt he had 
                a world apart, which he loved passionately and which had laws 
                she had not fathomed.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the 
                good work he was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: 
                &quot;Not in the least; it never entered my head and I wouldn't 
                do that for their good! That's all poetry and old wives' talk- 
                all that doing good to one's neighbor! What I want is that our 
                children should not have to go begging. I must put our affairs 
                in order while I am alive, that's all. And to do that, order and 
                strictness are essential.... That's all about it!&quot; said he, 
                clenching his vigorous fist. &quot;And fairness, of course,&quot; 
                he added, &quot;for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has 
                only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself 
                or for me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And all Nicholas did was fruitful- probably just because he 
                refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others 
                for virtue's sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring 
                estates came to beg him to buy them, and long after his death 
                the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among 
                the serfs. &quot;He was a master... the peasants' affairs first 
                and then his own. Of course he was not to be trifled with either- 
                in a word, he was a real master!&quot; </p>

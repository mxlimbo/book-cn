              <p> 　　At that very time, in circumstances even more important than 
                retreating without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning 
                of Moscow, Rostopchin, who is usually represented as being the 
                instigator of that event, acted in an altogether different manner 
                from Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　After the battle of Borodino the abandonment and burning of 
                Moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow 
                without fighting.</p>
              <p> 　　Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but 
                by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.</p>
              <p> 　　The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all 
                the towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolensk, 
                without the participation of Count Rostopchin and his broadsheets. 
                The people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become 
                excited or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling 
                within it the strength to find what it should do at that most 
                difficult moment. And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy 
                classes went away abandoning their property, while the poorer 
                remained and burned and destroyed what was left.</p>
              <p> 　　The consciousness that this would be so and would always be 
                so was and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness 
                of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present 
                in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow 
                already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they 
                expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and 
                abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from 
                the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or 
                by giving one's children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural 
                exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore 
                in the way that always produces the most powerful results.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards 
                are running away from Moscow,&quot; they were told. In his broadsheets 
                Rostopchin impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. 
                They were ashamed to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but 
                still they left, knowing it had to be done. Why did they go? It 
                is impossible to suppose that Rostopchin had scared them by his 
                accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered countries. 
                The first people to go away were the rich educated people who 
                knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and 
                that during Napoleon's occupation the inhabitants had spent their 
                time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom 
                the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so 
                much.</p>
              <p> 　　They went away because for Russians there could be no question 
                as to whether things would go well or ill under French rule in 
                Moscow. It was out of the question to be under French rule, it 
                would be the worst thing that could happen. They went away even 
                before the battle of Borodino and still more rapidly after it, 
                despite Rostopchin's calls to defend Moscow or the announcement 
                of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the Iberian 
                Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were to 
                destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchin wrote 
                in his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, 
                and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young 
                ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to 
                fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they were 
                to abandon their property to destruction. They went away without 
                thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy 
                city being given over to destruction, for a great city with wooden 
                buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be 
                burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was 
                only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event 
                was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of 
                the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count 
                Rostopchin's orders, had already in June moved with her Negroes 
                and her women jesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with 
                a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte's servant, was 
                really, simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved 
                Russia. But Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those who left Moscow 
                and now had the government offices removed; now distributed quite 
                useless weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying 
                the icons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or 
                the relics of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow 
                and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon 
                that was being constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would 
                burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house; 
                now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them 
                for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having 
                hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed; 
                now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, 
                and now reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French 
                residents from Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalme (the 
                center of the whole French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered 
                the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be arrested and exiled 
                for no particular offense; now assembled the people at the Three 
                Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of them, handed 
                over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back 
                gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow, 
                and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in 
                the affair- this man did not understand the meaning of what was 
                happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would 
                astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and 
                like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event- 
                the abandonment and burning of Moscow- and tried with his puny 
                hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that 
                bore him along with it. </p>

              <p> 　　On returning to Gorki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre 
                ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early 
                in the morning, and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition 
                in a corner Boris had given up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had 
                already left the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows 
                and his groom was shaking him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!&quot; 
                he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the 
                shoulder without looking at him, having apparently lost hope of 
                getting him to wake up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? Has it begun? Is it time?&quot; Pierre asked, 
                waking up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hear the firing,&quot; said the groom, a discharged 
                soldier. &quot;All the gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene 
                Highness himself rode past long ago.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all 
                was bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting 
                forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, 
                with rays still half broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the 
                street opposite, on the dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the 
                walls of the houses, on the windows, the fence, and on Pierre's 
                horses standing before the hut. The roar of guns sounded more 
                distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed 
                by at a sharp trot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's time, Count; it's time!&quot; cried the adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went 
                down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field 
                of battle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled 
                there, members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, 
                and Kutuzov's gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, 
                his gray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through 
                a field glass down the highroad before him.</p>
              <p> 　　Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene 
                before him, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he 
                had admired from that spot the day before, but now the whole place 
                was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, 
                and the slanting rays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the 
                left behind Pierre, cast upon it through the clear morning air 
                penetrating streaks of rosy, golden tinted light and long dark 
                shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama 
                seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; 
                its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and 
                was pierced beyond Valuevo by the Smolensk highroad crowded with 
                troops. Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed 
                with copses. There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front 
                and to the right and left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; 
                but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield 
                itself, of Borodino and the hollows on both sides of the Kolocha.</p>
              <p> 　　Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially 
                to the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls 
                into the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, 
                and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and 
                magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns 
                mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through 
                that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing 
                back like lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the 
                bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and 
                in Borodino. A white church could be seen through the mist, and 
                here and there the roofs of huts in Borodino as well as dense 
                masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And 
                all this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread 
                out over the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow 
                near Borodino, so along the entire line outside and above it and 
                especially in the woods and fields to the left, in the valleys 
                and on the summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke 
                seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now singly, now 
                several at a time, some translucent, others dense, which, swelling, 
                growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the whole expanse.</p>
              <p> 　　These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of sound 
                of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Puff!&quot;- suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke 
                was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white, and &quot;boom!&quot; 
                came the report a second later.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Puff! puff!&quot;- and two clouds arose pushing one 
                another and blending together; and &quot;boom, boom!&quot; came 
                the sounds confirming what the eye had seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen 
                as a round compact ball, and in its place already were balloons 
                of smoke floating to one side, and- &quot;puff&quot; (with a pause)- 
                &quot;puff, puff!&quot; three and then four more appeared and 
                then from each, with the same interval- &quot;boom- boom, boom!&quot; 
                came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if 
                those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while 
                woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the 
                left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were 
                continually appearing followed by their solemn reports, while 
                nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the muskets 
                small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had their 
                little echoes in just the same way. &quot;Trakh-ta-ta-takh!&quot; 
                came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and 
                feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, 
                that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov 
                and his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. 
                They were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as 
                it seemed to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were 
                now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed 
                the day before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince 
                Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!&quot; 
                Kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking 
                his eye from the battlefield.</p>
              <p> 　　Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on 
                his way down the knoll.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the crossing!&quot; said the general coldly and sternly 
                in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll go there too, I too!&quot; thought Pierre, and 
                followed the general.</p>
              <p> 　　The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre 
                went to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which 
                was the quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and 
                turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, 
                feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let 
                go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the general, causing 
                the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll.</p>

              <p> 　　On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to 
                the gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchin's adjutant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have been looking for you everywhere,&quot; said 
                the adjutant. &quot;The count wants to see you particularly. He 
                asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the 
                Moscow commander in chief.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from 
                his summer villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom and reception room 
                of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had 
                come for orders. Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count 
                and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and 
                that it would have to be surrendered. Though this news was being 
                concealed from the inhabitants, the officials- the heads of the 
                various government departments- knew that Moscow would soon be 
                in the enemy's hands, just as Count Rostopchin himself knew it, 
                and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the 
                governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments.</p>
              <p> 　　As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the 
                army came out of Rostopchin's private room.</p>
              <p> 　　In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier 
                made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes 
                watched the various officials, old and young, military and civilian, 
                who were there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre 
                went up to a group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting 
                Pierre they continued their conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If they're sent out and brought back again later on 
                it will do no harm, but as things are now one can't answer for 
                anything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you see what he writes...&quot; said another, pointing 
                to a printed sheet he held in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's another matter. That's necessary for the people,&quot; 
                said the first.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, it's a fresh broadsheet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took it and began reading. </p>
              <p> 　　His Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in order to 
                join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong 
                position where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty eight 
                guns with ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene 
                Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood 
                and is even ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, 
                that the law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, 
                and we will deal with villains in our own way! When the time comes 
                I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry 
                a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold 
                my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a 
                three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier 
                than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian 
                icon of the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital 
                where we will have some water blessed. That will help them to 
                get well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore 
                but now I am on the lookout with both. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But military men have told me that it is impossible 
                to fight in the town,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;and that the position...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, of course! That's what we were saying,&quot; replied 
                the first speaker.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what does he mean by 'One of my eyes was sore but 
                now I am on the lookout with both'?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count had a sty,&quot; replied the adjutant smiling, 
                &quot;and was very much upset when I told him people had come 
                to ask what was the matter with him. By the by, Count,&quot; he 
                added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, &quot;we heard 
                that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have heard nothing,&quot; Pierre replied unconcernedly. 
                &quot;But what have you heard?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only 
                say what I heard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what did you hear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, they say,&quot; continued the adjutant with the 
                same smile, &quot;that the countess, your wife, is preparing to 
                go abroad. I expect it's nonsense....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Possibly,&quot; remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. 
                &quot;And who is that?&quot; he asked, indicating a short old 
                man in a clean blue peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard 
                and eyebrows and a ruddy face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He? That's a tradesman, that is to say, he's the restaurant 
                keeper, Vereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with 
                the proclamation.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!&quot; said Pierre, looking 
                at the firm, calm face of the old man and seeking any indication 
                of his being a traitor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's not he himself, that's the father of the fellow 
                who wrote the proclamation,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;The 
                young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German 
                wearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a complicated story, you know,&quot; said the adjutant. 
                &quot;That proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count 
                was informed of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. 
                Gabriel Ivanovich here made the inquiries. The proclamation had 
                passed through exactly sixty-three hands. He asked one, 'From 
                whom did you get it?' 'From so-and-so.' He went to the next one. 
                'From whom did you get it?' and so on till he reached Vereshchagin, 
                a half educated tradesman, you know, 'a pet of a trader,'&quot; 
                said the adjutant smiling. &quot;They asked him, 'Who gave it 
                you?' And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could 
                only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come 
                to some understanding. He replied: 'From no one; I made it up 
                myself.' They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: 
                'I made it up myself.' And so it was reported to the count, who 
                sent for the man. 'From whom did you get the proclamation?' 'I 
                wrote it myself.' Well, you know the count,&quot; said the adjutant 
                cheerfully, with a smile of pride, &quot;he flared up dreadfully- 
                and just think of the fellow's audacity, lying, and obstinacy!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? 
                I understand!&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not at all,&quot; rejoined the adjutant in dismay. &quot;Klyucharev 
                had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he 
                has been banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. 
                'How could you have written it yourself?' said he, and he took 
                up the Hamburg Gazette that was lying on the table. 'Here it is! 
                You did not write it yourself but translated it, and translated 
                it abominably, because you don't even know French, you fool.' 
                And what do you think? 'No,' said he, 'I have not read any papers, 
                I made it up myself.' 'If that's so, you're a traitor and I'll 
                have you tried, and you'll be hanged! Say from whom you had it.' 
                'I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.' And that was the 
                end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck 
                to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. 
                Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he's a good-for-nothing 
                lad! You know that sort of tradesman's son, a dandy and lady-killer. 
                He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil 
                is no match for him. That's the sort of fellow he is. His father 
                keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there 
                was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a scepter in one 
                hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon home with 
                him for a few days and what did he do? He found some scoundrel 
                of a painter...&quot;</p>

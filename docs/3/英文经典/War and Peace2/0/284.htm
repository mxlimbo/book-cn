              <p> 　　Next day the decrepit Kutuzov, having given orders to be called 
                early, said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness 
                of having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his 
                caleche and drove from Letashovka (a village three and a half 
                miles from Tarutino) to the place where the attacking columns 
                were to meet. He sat in the caleche, dozing and waking up by turns, 
                and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication 
                that the action had begun. But all was still quiet. A damp dull 
                autumn morning was just dawning. On approaching Tarutino Kutuzov 
                noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road 
                along which he was driving. Kutuzov looked at them searchingly, 
                stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged 
                to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in front 
                and in ambush long before then. &quot;It may be a mistake,&quot; 
                thought the old commander in chief. But a little further on he 
                saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, 
                only partly dressed, eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. 
                He sent for an officer. The officer reported that no order to 
                advance had been received.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How! Not rec...&quot; Kutuzov began, but checked himself 
                immediately and sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his 
                caleche, he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing 
                silently up and down. When Eykhen, the officer of the general 
                staff whom he had summoned, appeared, Kutuzov went purple in the 
                face, not because that officer was to blame for the mistake, but 
                because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent 
                his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell into that 
                state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground, 
                and he fell upon Eykhen, threatening him with his hands, shouting 
                and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain Brozin, 
                who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered 
                the same fate.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What sort of another blackguard are you? I'll have you 
                shot! Scoundrels!&quot; yelled Kutuzov in a hoarse voice, waving 
                his arms and reeling.</p>
              <p> 　　He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a 
                Serene Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no 
                man had ever had in Russia, to be placed in this position- made 
                the laughingstock of the whole army! &quot;I needn't have been 
                in such a hurry to pray about today, or have kept awake thinking 
                everything over all night,&quot; thought he to himself. &quot;When 
                I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me 
                so... and now!&quot; He was in a state of physical suffering as 
                if from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it 
                by cries of anger and distress. But his strength soon began to 
                fail him, and looking about him, conscious of having said much 
                that was amiss, he again got into his caleche and drove back in 
                silence.</p>
              <p> 　　His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly 
                he listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermolov did not 
                come to see him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, 
                Konovnitsyn, and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should 
                be executed next day. And once more Kutuzov had to consent.</p>

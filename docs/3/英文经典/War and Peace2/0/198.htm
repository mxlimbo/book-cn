              <p> 　　Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince 
                Andrew supposed.</p>
              <p> 　　After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince 
                suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen 
                to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter 
                to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to 
                remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving 
                to the commander in chief's discretion to take measures or not 
                for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia's oldest generals 
                would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household 
                that he would remain at Bald Hills.</p>
              <p> 　　But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the 
                departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince 
                to Bogucharovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by 
                her father's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous 
                apathy, could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the 
                first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to 
                go away and her father's fury broke over her in a terrible storm. 
                He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying 
                to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his 
                quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making 
                it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove 
                her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it 
                was all the same to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember 
                her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her. The 
                fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to be carried 
                away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered 
                Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his 
                soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away.</p>
              <p> 　　The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince 
                donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in 
                chief. His caleche was already at the door. Princess Mary saw 
                him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders 
                and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic 
                serfs. She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached 
                her from the garden. Suddenly several men came running up the 
                avenue with frightened faces.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered 
                path, and into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics 
                were moving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting 
                by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform 
                and decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight 
                that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree 
                avenue, could not be sure what change there was in his face. All 
                she could see was that his former stern and determined expression 
                had altered to one of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter 
                he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible 
                to make out what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, 
                and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and 
                said that the prince had had seizure a paralyzing his right side.</p>
              <p> 　　It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald 
                Hills, and next day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo, the 
                doctor accompanying him.</p>
              <p> 　　By the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little 
                prince had already left for Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in 
                the new house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in 
                the same state, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious 
                and lay like a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his 
                eyebrows and lips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether 
                he understood what was going on around him or not. One thing was 
                certain- that he was suffering and wished to say something. But 
                what it was, no one could tell: it might be some caprice of a 
                sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate to public affairs, 
                or possibly to family concerns.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and 
                was due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished 
                to tell her something, and the fact that her presence always increased 
                his restlessness confirmed her opinion.</p>
              <p> 　　He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There 
                was no hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, 
                it would not do to let him die on the road. &quot;Would it not 
                be better if the end did come, the very end?&quot; Princess Mary 
                sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly sleeping at all, she 
                watched him and, terrible to say, often watched him not with hope 
                of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of 
                the approach of the end.</p>
              <p> 　　Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, 
                yet there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was 
                that since her father's illness began (perhaps even sooner, when 
                she stayed with him expecting something to happen), all the personal 
                desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her 
                had awakened. Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years- 
                thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father, and even 
                the possibility of love and of family happiness- floated continually 
                in her imagination like temptations of the devil. Thrust them 
                aside as she would, questions continually recurred to her as to 
                how she would order her life now, after that. These were temptations 
                of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole 
                weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed 
                an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words 
                of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different 
                world had now taken possession of her- the life of a world of 
                strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world 
                in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest 
                comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not weep, and 
                worldly cares took possession of her.</p>
              <p> 　　It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. News of 
                the approach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, 
                ten miles from Bogucharovo, a homestead had been looted by French 
                marauders.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; 
                the provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess 
                Mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the 
                head of the rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the 
                same thing, saying that the French were only some twenty-five 
                miles away, that French proclamations were circulating in the 
                villages, and that if the princess did not take her father away 
                before the fifteenth, he could not answer for the consequences.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares 
                of preparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, 
                occupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as 
                usual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the 
                prince lay. Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and 
                muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of Tikhon and the 
                doctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at 
                the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder 
                than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not 
                sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing 
                to enter but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess 
                Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his 
                account was to him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction 
                he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. 
                She knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour 
                would irritate him.</p>
              <p> 　　But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid 
                of losing him. She recalled all her life with him and in every 
                word and act of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally 
                amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into 
                her imagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, 
                and how her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove 
                these thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet 
                and she fell asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking 
                showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's 
                illness. On waking she listened to what was going on behind the 
                door and, hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that 
                things were still the same.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what could have happened? What did I want? I want 
                his death!&quot; she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.</p>
              <p> 　　She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the 
                porch. In front of it stood carriages without horses and things 
                were being packed into the vehicles.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the 
                porch, still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to 
                arrange her thoughts before going to her father. The doctor came 
                downstairs and went out to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a little better today,&quot; said he. &quot;I 
                was looking for you. One can make out something of what he is 
                saying. His head is clearer. Come in, he is asking for you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary's heart beat so violently at this news that 
                she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. 
                To see him, talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole 
                soul was overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, 
                was a torment of joy and terror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come,&quot; said the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary entered her father's room and went up to his 
                bed. He was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony 
                hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; 
                his left eye gazed straight before him, his right eye was awry, 
                and his brows and lips motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, 
                small, and pathetic. His face seemed to have shriveled or melted; 
                his features had grown smaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed 
                his hand. His left hand pressed hers so that she understood that 
                he had long been waiting for her to come. He twitched her hand, 
                and his brows and lips quivered angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted 
                of her. When she changed her position so that his left eye could 
                see her face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some 
                seconds. Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began 
                to speak, gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid 
                that she might not understand.</p>
              <p> 　　Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The 
                comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her 
                eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. 
                He said something, repeating the same words several times. She 
                could not understand them, but tried to guess what he was saying 
                and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mmm...ar...ate...ate...&quot; he repeated several times.</p>
              <p> 　　It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor 
                thought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: &quot;Mary, 
                are you afraid?&quot; The prince shook his head, again repeated 
                the same sounds.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My mind, my mind aches?&quot; questioned Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her 
                hand, and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as 
                if trying to find the right place for it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...&quot; he 
                then uttered much more clearly than he had done before, now that 
                he was sure of being understood.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to 
                hide her sobs and tears.</p>
              <p> 　　He moved his hand over her hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have been calling you all night...&quot; he brought 
                out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If only I had known...&quot; she said through her tears. 
                &quot;I was afraid to come in.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He pressed her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Weren't you asleep?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I did not sleep,&quot; said Princess Mary, shaking 
                her head.</p>
              <p> 　　Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express 
                herself as he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue 
                too seemed to move with difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear one... Dearest...&quot; Princess Mary could not 
                quite make out what he had said, but from his look it was clear 
                that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never 
                used to her before. &quot;Why didn't you come in?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I was wishing for his death!&quot; thought Princess 
                Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　He was silent awhile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... 
                thank you!... forgive!... thank you!...&quot; and tears began 
                to flow from his eyes. &quot;Call Andrew!&quot; he said suddenly, 
                and a childish, timid expression of doubt showed itself on his 
                face as he spoke.</p>
              <p> 　　He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So 
                at least it seemed to Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have a letter from him,&quot; she replied.</p>
              <p> 　　He glanced at her with timid surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's with the army, Father, at Smolensk.&quot; <br>
                　　He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as 
                if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he 
                understood and remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened 
                his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, softly and distinctly. &quot;Russia 
                has perished. They've destroyed her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. 
                Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while 
                she gazed at his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his 
                eyes, and Tikhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them 
                could understand for a long time, till at last Tikhon understood 
                and repeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words 
                in the mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he 
                was speaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, 
                or of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Put on your white dress. I like it,&quot; was what he 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, 
                and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing 
                her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When 
                she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his 
                son, about the war, and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his 
                brows and raising his hoarse voice, and then he had a second and 
                final stroke.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, 
                it was hot and sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing 
                and feel nothing, except passionate love for her father, love 
                such as she thought she had never felt till that moment. She ran 
                out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond, along the 
                avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted 
                it to end quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will 
                become of me? What use will peace be when he is no longer here?&quot; 
                Princess Mary murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and 
                pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought 
                her again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne- who had 
                remained at Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it- coming toward 
                her with a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the 
                district, who had come personally to point out to the princess 
                the necessity for her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened 
                without understanding him; she led him to the house, offered him 
                lunch, and sat down with him. Then, excusing herself, she went 
                to the door of the old prince's room. The doctor came out with 
                an agitated face and said she could not enter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the 
                foot of the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She 
                did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused 
                by the sound of a woman's footsteps running along the path. She 
                rose and saw Dunyasha her maid, who was evidently looking for 
                her, and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please come, Princess... The Prince,&quot; said Dunyasha 
                in a breaking voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming!&quot; replied the 
                princess hurriedly, not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she 
                was saying, and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward 
                the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess, it's God's will! You must be prepared for 
                everything,&quot; said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me alone; it's not true!&quot; she cried angrily 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran 
                to her father's door. &quot;Why are these people with frightened 
                faces stopping me? I don't want any of them! And what are they 
                doing here?&quot; she thought. She opened the door and the bright 
                daylight in that previously darkened room startled her. In the 
                room were her nurse and other women. They all drew back from the 
                bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the bed as before, 
                but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess Mary 
                stop short on the threshold.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he's not dead- it's impossible!&quot; she told herself 
                and approached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, 
                she pressed her lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. 
                All the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished 
                instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay 
                there before her. &quot;No, he is no more! He is not, but here 
                where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, 
                terrifying, and repellent mystery!&quot; And hiding her face in 
                her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, who 
                held her up. </p>
              <p> 　　In the presence of Tikhon and the doctor the women washed 
                what had been the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief 
                that the mouth should not stiffen while open, and with another 
                handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading 
                apart. Then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and 
                placed his shriveled little body on a table. Heaven only knows 
                who arranged all this and when, but it all got done as if of its 
                own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his coffin, 
                a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of 
                juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, 
                and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, 
                so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing 
                room round the coffin- the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant 
                women- and all with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, 
                bowed and kissed the old prince's cold and stiffened hand. </p>

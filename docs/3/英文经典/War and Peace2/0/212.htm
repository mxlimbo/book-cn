              <p> 　　Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?&quot; 
                said a voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees 
                with his hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt 
                before the icon), came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly 
                dressed, with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. 
                He wore a long coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his 
                shoulder.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself 
                in the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack 
                had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An 
                immense and brilliant suite surrounded him.</p>
              <p> 　　The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre 
                stopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see 
                the position.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what you must do,&quot; said Boris. &quot;I 
                will do the honors of the camp to you. You will see everything 
                best from where Count Bennigsen will be. I am in attendance on 
                him, you know; I'll mention it to him. But if you want to ride 
                round the position, come along with us. We are just going to the 
                left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night with me 
                and we'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmitri Sergeevich? 
                Those are his quarters,&quot; and he pointed to the third house 
                in the village of Gorki.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I should like to see the right flank. They say it's 
                very strong,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I should like to start from 
                the Moskva River and ride round the whole position.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is 
                the left flank.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski's regiment? 
                Can you point it out to me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll take you 
                to him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　What about the left flank?&quot; asked Pierre</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows 
                what state our left flank is in,&quot; said Boris confidentially 
                lowering his voice. &quot;It is not at all what Count Bennigsen 
                intended. He meant to fortify that knoll quite differently, but...&quot; 
                Boris shrugged his shoulders, &quot;his Serene Highness would 
                not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...&quot; but Boris 
                did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov, Kutuzov's adjutant, 
                came up to Pierre. &quot;Ah, Kaysarov!&quot; said Boris, addressing 
                him with an unembarrassed smile, &quot;I was just trying to explain 
                our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness 
                could so the intentions of the French!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You mean the left flank?&quot; asked Kaysarov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the 
                staff, Boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the 
                changes. He had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, 
                like all on whom Boris had been in attendance, considered young 
                Prince Drubetskoy an invaluable man.</p>
              <p> 　　In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: 
                Kutuzov's party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris 
                belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile 
                respect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old 
                fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. 
                Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would 
                be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov 
                won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. 
                In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow's 
                action, and new men would come to the front. So Boris was full 
                of nervous vivacity all day.</p>
              <p> 　　After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and 
                he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that 
                were showered upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. 
                The faces all expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed 
                to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these 
                faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success; his mind, 
                however, was occupied by the different expression he saw on other 
                faces- an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of 
                the universal questions of life and death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's 
                figure and the group gathered round him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Call him to me,&quot; said Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness' wish, and 
                Pierre went toward Kutuzov's bench. But a militiaman got there 
                before him. It was Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How did that fellow get here?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!&quot; was 
                the answer. &quot;He has been degraded, you know. Now he wants 
                to bob up again. He's been proposing some scheme or other and 
                has crawled into the enemy's picket line at night.... He's a brave 
                fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness 
                you might send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, 
                but then I shouldn't lose anything...&quot; Dolokhov was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But if I were right, I should be rendering a service 
                to my Fatherland for which I am ready to die.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And should your Serene Highness require a man who will 
                not spare his skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove 
                useful to your Serene Highness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... Yes...&quot; Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye 
                narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped 
                up to Pierre's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, 
                without raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing 
                an interrupted conversation:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready 
                to die. What heroism, Count!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard 
                by his Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov's attention would be caught 
                by those words, and so it was.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you saying about the militia?&quot; he asked 
                Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness- for death- 
                they have put on clean shirts.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!&quot; said Kutuzov; 
                and he closed his eyes and swayed his head. &quot;A matchless 
                people!&quot; he repeated with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you want to smell gunpowder?&quot; he said to Pierre. 
                &quot;Yes, it's a pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of 
                your wife's adorers. Is she well? My quarters are at your service.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking 
                about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or 
                do.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to 
                Andrew Kaysarov, his adjutant's brother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those verses... those verses of Marin's... how do they 
                go, eh? Those he wrote about Gerakov: 'Lectures for the corps 
                inditing'... Recite them, recite them!&quot; said he, evidently 
                preparing to laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to 
                the rhythm of the verses.</p>
              <p> 　　When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and 
                took his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very glad to meet you here, Count,&quot; he said 
                aloud, regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly 
                resolute and solemn tone. &quot;On the eve of a day when God alone 
                knows who of us is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity 
                to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings that occurred 
                between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for 
                me. I beg you to forgive me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to 
                say to him. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and 
                kissed him.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen 
                turned to Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along 
                the line.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It will interest you,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, very much,&quot; replied Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen 
                and his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along 
                the line.</p>

              <p> 　　 Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the 
                divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and 
                the subjection of that man's will to the Deity, history cannot 
                without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one 
                of two things: either a return to the former belief in the direct 
                intervention of the Deity in human affairs or a definite explanation 
                of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed 
                &quot;power.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; 
                and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are 
                so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that 
                the question: why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when 
                Napoleon uttered certain words, seems to us senseless. He had 
                the power and so what he ordered was done.</p>
              <p> 　　This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power 
                was given him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it 
                becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over 
                others.</p>
              <p> 　　It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over 
                a weak one- a domination based on the application or threat of 
                physical force, like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based 
                on the effect of moral force, as in their simplicity some historians 
                think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes, 
                that is, men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called 
                genius. This power cannot be based on the predominance of moral 
                strength, for, not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose 
                moral qualities opinions differ widely, history shows us that 
                neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over millions of 
                people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the contrary 
                were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled 
                over.</p>
              <p> 　　If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in 
                the moral qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently 
                be looked for elsewhere- in the relation to the people of the 
                man who wields the power.</p>
              <p> 　　And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence, 
                that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history's 
                understanding of power for true gold.</p>
              <p> 　　Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by 
                expressed or tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.</p>
              <p> 　　In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions 
                of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for 
                all that to be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied 
                to history that definition of power needs explanation.</p>
              <p> 　　The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as 
                the ancients regarded fire- namely, as something existing absolutely. 
                But for history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just 
                as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　From this fundamental difference between the view held by 
                history and that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence 
                can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted 
                and what power- existing immutably outside time- is, but to history's 
                questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time 
                it can answer nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　If power be the collective will of the people transferred 
                to their ruler, was Pugachev a representative of the will of the 
                people? If not, then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III 
                a criminal when he was taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later 
                on, were those criminals whom he arrested?</p>
              <p> 　　Do palace revolutions- in which sometimes only two or three 
                people take part- transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? 
                In international relations, is the will of the people also transferred 
                to their conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine 
                transferred to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people 
                transferred to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with 
                the French went to fight the Austrians?</p>
              <p> 　　To these questions three answers are possible:</p>
              <p> 　　Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always 
                unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, 
                and that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle 
                against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded 
                as an infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of 
                the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite 
                and known conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, 
                and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by 
                the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted 
                to them; or (3) that the will of the people is delegated to the 
                rulers conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and 
                indefinite, and that the appearance of several authorities, their 
                struggles and their falls, result solely from the greater or lesser 
                fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which 
                the will of the people is transferred from some people to others.</p>
              <p> 　　And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain 
                the relation of the people to their rulers.</p>
              <p> 　　Some historians- those biographical and specialist historians 
                already referred to- in their simplicity failing to understand 
                the question of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the 
                collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to 
                historical persons, and therefore when describing some single 
                state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute 
                and real power, and that any other force opposing this is not 
                a power but a violation of power- mere violence.</p>
              <p> 　　Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods 
                of history, has the inconvenience- in application to complex and 
                stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers 
                arise simultaneously and struggle with one another- that a Legitimist 
                historian will prove that the National Convention, the Directory, 
                and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power, while a 
                Republican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the Convention 
                and the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all 
                the others were violations of power. Evidently the explanations 
                furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can 
                only satisfy young children.</p>
              <p> 　　Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set 
                of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation 
                of the will of the people to their rulers, and that historical 
                leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program 
                that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed 
                to them. But what this program consists in these historians do 
                not say, or if they do they continually contradict one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes 
                a nation's progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, 
                wealth, freedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some 
                other country. But not to mention the historians' contradictions 
                as to the nature of this program- or even admitting that some 
                one general program of these conditions exists- the facts of history 
                almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions under 
                which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment 
                of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible 
                end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are 
                executed by their people? To this question historians reply that 
                Louis XIV's activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis 
                XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV- why 
                should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit 
                for such reactions? To these questions there are and can be no 
                answers. Equally little does this view explain why for several 
                centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers 
                and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of fifty years 
                is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, 
                to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to Charles X, 
                to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to Napoleon 
                III. When explaining these rapid transfers of the people's will 
                from from one individual to another, especially in view of international 
                relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are obliged 
                to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations 
                of the people's will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on 
                mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, 
                or a party leader. So that the greater part of the events of history- 
                civil wars, revolutions, and conquests- are presented by these 
                historians not as the results of free transferences of the people's 
                will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, 
                that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians 
                also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the 
                theory.</p>
              <p> 　　These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that 
                some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist 
                that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and 
                that the palm, the mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into 
                full growth and no longer resemble two leaves, are deviations 
                from the theory.</p>
              <p> 　　Historians of the third class assume that the will of the 
                people is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but 
                that the conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical 
                personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the 
                people which has been delegated to them.</p>
              <p> 　　But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not 
                in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance 
                have those leaders?</p>
              <p> 　　The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of 
                the people: the activity of the leaders represents the activity 
                of the people.</p>
              <p> 　　But in that case the question arises whether all the activity 
                of the leaders serves as an expression of the people's will or 
                only some part of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves 
                as the expression of the people's will, as some historians suppose, 
                then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies 
                of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the 
                nation, which is evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular 
                side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express 
                the people's life, as other so-called &quot;philosophical&quot; 
                historians believe, then to determine which side of the activity 
                of a leader expresses the nation's life, we have first of all 
                to know in what the nation's life consists.</p>
              <p> 　　Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some 
                most obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover 
                all conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be 
                the aim of humanity's movement. The most usual generalizations 
                adopted by almost all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, 
                progress, civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization 
                as the goal of the movement of humanity, the historians study 
                the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained: 
                kings, ministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, 
                to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted 
                or hindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way proved that 
                the aim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality, enlightenment, 
                or civilization, and as the connection of the people with the 
                rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary 
                assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred 
                to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the activity 
                of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, 
                and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the 
                activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice 
                agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.</p>
              <p> 　　History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples 
                of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive 
                eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, 
                their mistresses and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, 
                Rousseau, Diderot, Beaumarchais, and others?</p>
              <p> 　　Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and 
                Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the 
                Terrible and by his correspondence with Kurbski?</p>
              <p> 　　Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades 
                explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es 
                and their ladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west 
                to east, without leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter 
                the Hermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible 
                is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim 
                for the Crusade- the deliverance of Jerusalem- had been clearly 
                defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings, and knights incited 
                the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, 
                for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go 
                no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers 
                can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history 
                of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history 
                of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the 
                peoples and their impulses has remained unknown.</p>
              <p> 　　Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain 
                to us the life of the peoples.</p>
              <p> 　　The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions 
                of life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther 
                had a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that 
                Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we 
                do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one 
                another, nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined 
                one another.</p>
              <p> 　　If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the 
                newest historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, 
                but not the history of the life of the peoples.</p>

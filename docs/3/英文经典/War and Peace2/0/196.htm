              <p> 　　Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena 
                of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance 
                prevails and those in which form prevails. To the latter- as distinguished 
                from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life- we may 
                allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. 
                That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we 
                had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had 
                made constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna 
                Pavlovna Helene remained just as they had been- the one seven 
                and the other five years before. At Anna Pavlovna's they talked 
                with perplexity of Bonaparte's successes just as before and saw 
                in them and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns 
                a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause 
                unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna Pavlovna 
                was the representative. And in Helene's salon, which Rumyantsev 
                himself honored with his visits, regarding Helene as a remarkably 
                intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as 
                in 1808 of the &quot;great nation&quot; and the &quot;great man,&quot; 
                and regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according 
                to them, ought to be promptly terminated by peace.</p>
              <p> 　　Of late, since the Emperor's return from the army, there had 
                been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some 
                demonstrations of hostility to one another, but each camp retained 
                its own tendency. In Anna Pavlovna's circle only those Frenchmen 
                were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic 
                views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to 
                the French theater and that to maintain the French troupe was 
                costing the government as much as a whole army corps. The progress 
                of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering 
                to our army were circulated. In the French circle of Helene and 
                Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the 
                war were contradicted and all Napoleon's attempts at conciliation 
                were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those who 
                advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazan of the court 
                and the girls' educational establishments under the patronage 
                of the Dowager Empress. In Helene's circle the war in general 
                was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would 
                very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bilibin- 
                who now in Petersburg was quite at home in Helene's house, which 
                every clever man was obliged to visit- that not by gunpowder but 
                by those who invented it would matters be settled. In that circle 
                the Moscow enthusiasm- news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously 
                with the Emperor's return- was ridiculed sarcastically and very 
                cleverly, though with much caution.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this 
                enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of 
                the ancients. Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important 
                posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He 
                visited his &quot;good friend Anna Pavlovna&quot; as well as his 
                daughter's &quot;diplomatic salon,&quot; and often in his constant 
                comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said 
                at Helene's what he should have said at Anna Pavlovna's and vice 
                versa.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after the Emperor's return Prince Vasili in a conversation 
                about the war at Anna Pavlovna's severely condemned Barclay de 
                Tolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander 
                in chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as &quot;a man 
                of great merit,&quot; having described how he had that day seen 
                Kutuzov, the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding 
                over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured 
                to suggest that Kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov 
                had done nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,&quot; 
                Prince Vasili interrupted, &quot;but they did not listen to me. 
                I told them his election as chief of the militia would not please 
                the Emperor. They did not listen to me.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all this mania for opposition,&quot; he went on. 
                &quot;And who for? It is all because we want to ape the foolish 
                enthusiasm of those Muscovites,&quot; Prince Vasili continued, 
                forgetting for a moment that though at Helene's one had to ridicule 
                the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pavlovna's one had to be ecstatic 
                about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. &quot;Now, is 
                it suitable that Count Kutuzov, the oldest general in Russia, 
                should preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! 
                How could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount 
                a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the very worst 
                morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest! I 
                don't speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this 
                how they appoint they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively 
                blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can't see anything. 
                To play blindman's bluff? He can't see at all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No one replied to his remarks.</p>
              <p> 　　This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on 
                the twenty-ninth of July Kutuzov received the title of Prince. 
                This might indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince 
                Vasili's opinion continued to be correct though he was not now 
                in any hurry to express it. But on the eighth of August a committee, 
                consisting of Field Marshal Saltykov, Arakcheev, Vyazmitinov, 
                Lopukhin, and Kochubey met to consider the progress of the war. 
                This committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due 
                to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the 
                committee were aware of the Emperor's dislike of Kutuzov, after 
                a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as 
                commander in chief. That same day Kutuzov was appointed commander 
                in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region 
                occupied by them.</p>
              <p> 　　On the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna's again 
                met the &quot;man of great merit.&quot; The latter was very attentive 
                to Anna Pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of 
                one of the educational establishments for young ladies. Prince 
                Vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who 
                has attained the object of his desires.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutuzov 
                is field marshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, 
                so delighted! At last we have a man!&quot; said he, glancing sternly 
                and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　The &quot;man of great merit,&quot; despite his desire to 
                obtain the post of director, could not refrain from reminding 
                Prince Vasili of his former opinion. Though this was impolite 
                to Prince Vasili in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room, and also to 
                Anna Pavlovna herself who had received the news with delight, 
                he could not resist the temptation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Prince, they say he is blind!&quot; said he, reminding 
                Prince Vasili of his own words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,&quot; said Prince 
                Vasili rapidly, in a deep voice and with a slight cough- the voice 
                and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He sees well enough,&quot; he added. &quot;And what 
                I am so pleased about,&quot; he went on, &quot;is that our sovereign 
                has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region- 
                powers no commander in chief ever had before. He is a second autocrat,&quot; 
                he concluded with a victorious smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God grant it! God grant it!&quot; said Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　The &quot;man of great merit,&quot; who was still a novice 
                in court circles, wishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending 
                her former position on this question, observed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov 
                those powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde 
                is read, when he said to Kutuzov: 'Your Emperor and the Fatherland 
                award you this honor.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,&quot; 
                said Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no, no!&quot; warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, who 
                would not now yield Kutuzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutuzov 
                was not only admirable himself, but was adored by everybody. &quot;No, 
                that's impossible,&quot; said he, &quot;for our sovereign appreciated 
                him so highly before.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power 
                and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,&quot; observed 
                Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said 
                in a whisper:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition 
                that the Tsarevich should not be with the army. Do you know what 
                he said to the Emperor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Prince Vasili repeated the words supposed to have been 
                spoken by Kutuzov to the Emperor. &quot;I can neither punish him 
                if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I have known 
                him a long time!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They even say,&quot; remarked the &quot;man of great 
                merit&quot; who did not yet possess courtly tact, &quot;that his 
                excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself 
                should not be with the army.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as he said this both Prince Vasili and Anna Pavlovna 
                turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh 
                at his naivete. </p>

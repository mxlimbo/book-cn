              <p> 　　Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend- my pink one is delicious; 
                her name is Dunyasha....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But on glancing at Rostov's face Ilyin stopped short. He saw 
                that his hero and commander was following quite a different train 
                of thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode 
                off with rapid steps to the village.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll show them; I'll give it to them, the brigands!&quot; 
                said he to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, 
                kept up with him with difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What decision have you been pleased to come to?&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly 
                turned on Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...&quot; cried 
                he. &quot;What have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, 
                and you can't manage them? You're a traitor youself! I know you. 
                I'll flay you all alive!...&quot; And as if afraid of wasting 
                his store of anger, he left Alpatych and went rapidly forward. 
                Alpatych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rostov 
                at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the 
                peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would 
                be imprudent to &quot;overresist&quot; them without an armed force, 
                and would it not be better first to send for the military?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll give them armed force... I'll 'overresist' them!&quot; 
                uttered Rostov meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal 
                fury and the need to vent it.</p>
              <p> 　　Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously 
                with quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he 
                drew to it the more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action 
                might produce good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly 
                impressed when they saw Rostov's rapid, firm steps and resolute, 
                frowning face.</p>
              <p> 　　After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone 
                to see the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen 
                among the crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals 
                were Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being 
                detained. Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed 
                it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How many years have you been fattening on the commune?&quot; 
                Karp shouted at him. &quot;It's all one to you! You'll dig up 
                your pot of money and take it away with you.... What does it matter 
                to you whether our homes are ruined or not?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We've been told to keep order, and that no one is to 
                leave their homes or take away a single grain, and that's all 
                about it!&quot; cried another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was your son's turn to be conscripted, but no fear! 
                You begrudged your lump of a son,&quot; a little old man suddenly 
                began attacking Dron- &quot;and so they took my Vanka to be shaved 
                for a soldier! But we all have to die.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To be sure, we all have to die. I'm not against the 
                commune,&quot; said Dron.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's it- not against it! You've filled your belly....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, followed 
                by Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to the crowd, Karp, 
                thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked 
                to the front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the 
                crowd drew closer together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is your Elder here? Hey?&quot; shouted Rostov, coming 
                up to the crowd with quick steps.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Elder? What do you want with him?...&quot; asked 
                Karp.</p>
              <p> 　　But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew 
                off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Caps off, traitors!&quot; shouted Rostov in a wrathful 
                voice. &quot;Where's the Elder?&quot; he cried furiously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, 
                you!&quot; meek and flustered voices here and there were heard 
                calling and caps began to come off their heads.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We don't riot, we're following the orders,&quot; declared 
                Karp, and at that moment several voices began speaking together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's as the old men have decided- there's too many of 
                you giving orders.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!&quot; cried 
                Rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the 
                collar. &quot;Bind him, bind him!&quot; he shouted, though there 
                was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych.</p>
              <p> 　　Lavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms 
                from behind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?&quot; 
                he called out.</p>
              <p> 　　Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by 
                name to come and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the 
                crowd and began taking off their belts.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where's the Elder?&quot; demanded Rostov in a loud voice.</p>
              <p> 　　With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!&quot; shouted 
                Rostov, as if that order, too, could not possibly meet with any 
                opposition.</p>
              <p> 　　And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took 
                off his own belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you all listen to me!&quot; said Rostov to the peasants. 
                &quot;Be off to your houses at once, and don't let one of your 
                voices be heard!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, we've not done any harm! We did it just out of 
                foolishness. It's all nonsense... I said then that it was not 
                in order,&quot; voices were heard bickering with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! What did I say?&quot; said Alpatych, coming into 
                his own again. &quot;It's wrong, lads!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych,&quot; came the answers, 
                and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village.</p>
              <p> 　　The two bound men were led off to the master's house. The 
                two drunken peasants followed them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aye, when I look at you!...&quot; said one of them to 
                Karp.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can one talk to the masters like that? What were 
                you thinking of, you fool?&quot; added the other- &quot;A real 
                fool!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of 
                the Bogucharovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out 
                the proprietor's goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, 
                liberated at Princess Mary's wish from the cupboard where he had 
                been confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't put it in so carelessly,&quot; said one of the 
                peasants, a man with a round smiling face, taking a casket from 
                a housemaid. &quot;You know it has cost money! How can you chuck 
                it in like that or shove it under the cord where it'll get rubbed? 
                I don't like that way of doing things. Let it all be done properly, 
                according to rule. Look here, put it under the bast matting and 
                cover it with hay- that's the way!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, books, books!&quot; said another peasant, bringing 
                out Prince Andrew's library cupboards. &quot;Don't catch up against 
                it! It's heavy, lads- solid books.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, they worked all day and didn't play!&quot; remarked 
                the tall, round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant 
                wink at the dictionaries that were on the top. </p>
              <p> 　　Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov did not 
                go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her 
                departure. When her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted 
                and accompanied her eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the 
                road was occupied by our troops. At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully 
                took leave of her, for the first time permitting himself to kiss 
                her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can you speak so!&quot; he blushingly replied to 
                Princess Mary's expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, 
                as she termed what had occurred. &quot;Any police officer would 
                have done as much! If we had had only peasants to fight, we should 
                not have let the enemy come so far,&quot; said he with a sense 
                of shame and wishing to change the subject. &quot;I am only happy 
                to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Good-by, 
                Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet 
                you again in happier circumstances. If you don't want to make 
                me blush, please don't thank me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, 
                thanked him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with 
                gratitude and tenderness. She could not believe that there was 
                nothing to thank him for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain 
                that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands 
                of the mutineers and of the French, and that he had exposed himself 
                to terrible and obvious danger to save her, and even more certain 
                was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul, able to understand 
                her position and her sorrow. His kind, honest eyes, with the tears 
                rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke 
                of her loss, did leave her memory.</p>
              <p> 　　When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly 
                felt her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time 
                the strange question presented itself to her: did she love him?</p>
              <p> 　　On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess' position 
                was not a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage, 
                more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window 
                and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and 
                sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, supposing I do love him?&quot; thought Princess 
                Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had 
                fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she 
                comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know 
                it and that she would not be to blame if, without ever speaking 
                of it to anyone, she continued to the end of her life to love 
                the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last 
                time in her life.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his 
                words, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those 
                moments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of 
                the carriage window.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo, and 
                at that very moment?&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;And that 
                caused his sister to refuse my brother?&quot; And in all this 
                Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable 
                one. To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, 
                hearing of his adventure at Bogucharovo, rallied him on having 
                gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest 
                heiresses in Russia, he grew angry. It made him angry just because 
                the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive 
                to him and had an enormous fortune, had against his will more 
                than once entered his head. For himself personally Nicholas could 
                not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the 
                countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father's affairs 
                in order, and would even- he felt it- ensure Princess Mary's happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　But Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew 
                angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.</p>

              <p> 　　It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. 
                Natasha had been staying at her brother's with her husband and 
                children since early autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on 
                business of his own for three weeks as he said, but had remained 
                there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides the Bezukhov family, Nicholas' old friend the retired 
                General Vasili Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this 
                fifth of December.</p>
              <p> 　　On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would 
                be full of visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his 
                Tartar tunic for a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed 
                toes, and drive to the new church he had built, and then receive 
                visitors who would come to congratulate him, offer them refreshments, 
                and talk about the elections of the nobility; but he considered 
                himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way. 
                He examined the bailiff's accounts of the village in Ryazan which 
                belonged to his wife's nephew, wrote two business letters, and 
                walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and stables before 
                dinner. Having taken precautions against the general drunkenness 
                to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint's day, 
                he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk 
                with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, 
                at which the whole household had assembled. At that table were 
                his mother, his mother's old lady companion Belova, his wife, 
                their three children with their governess and tutor, his wife's 
                nephew with his tutor, Sonya, Denisov, Natasha, her three children, 
                their governess, and old Michael Ivanovich, the late prince's 
                architect, who was living on in retirement at Bald Hills.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her 
                husband took his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in 
                which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler 
                and wineglass standing before him, that he was out of humor, as 
                was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from 
                the farm- especially before the soup. Countess Mary well knew 
                that mood of his, and when she herself was in a good frame of 
                mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to 
                talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his 
                ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he 
                should be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. 
                She asked him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired 
                whether everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone 
                made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then I'm not mistaken,&quot; thought Countess Mary. 
                &quot;Why is he cross with me?&quot; She concluded from his tone 
                that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation. 
                She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but could not refrain 
                from asking some more questions.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became general 
                and lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left 
                the table and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess 
                Mary held out her hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why 
                he was angry with her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You always have such strange fancies! I didn't even 
                think of being angry,&quot; he replied.</p>
              <p> 　　But the word always seemed to her to imply: &quot;Yes, I am 
                angry but I won't tell you why.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even 
                Sonya and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked 
                them to disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but 
                even they had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it 
                was always just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly 
                had a feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most 
                frequently during Countess Mary's pregnancies, and this was such 
                a time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, messieurs et mesdames,&quot; said Nicholas loudly 
                and with apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that 
                he did it on purpose to vex her), &quot;I have been on my feet 
                since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today 
                I'll go and rest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting 
                room and lay down on the sofa.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's always the way,&quot; thought Countess Mary. 
                &quot;He talks to everyone except me. I see... I see that I am 
                repulsive to him, especially when I am in this condition.&quot; 
                She looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her 
                pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger 
                than ever.</p>
              <p> 　　And everything annoyed her- Denisov's shouting and laughter, 
                Natasha's talk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gave her.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for 
                feeling irritated.</p>
              <p> 　　Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding 
                anything of what they were saying, she softly left the room and 
                went to the nursery.</p>
              <p> 　　The children were playing at &quot;going to Moscow&quot; in 
                a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them. She 
                sat down and played with them a little, but the thought of her 
                husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her. She got up 
                and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to the small sitting 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps he is not asleep; I'll have an explanation with 
                him,&quot; she said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, 
                imitating his mother, followed her on tiptoe. She not notice him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary, dear, I think he is asleep- he was so tired,&quot; 
                said Sonya, meeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to 
                Countess Mary that she crossed her path everywhere). &quot;Andrew 
                may wake him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, 
                felt that Sonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and 
                with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. 
                She made no reply, but to avoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew 
                to follow her quietly and went to the door. Sonya went away by 
                another door. From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came 
                the sound of his even breathing, every slightest tone of which 
                was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw before 
                her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole 
                face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night 
                when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. 
                And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: 
                &quot;Papa! Mamma's standing here!&quot; Countess Mary turned 
                pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and 
                quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew 
                how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard 
                Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice 
                said crossly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't get a moment's peace.... Mary, is that you? 
                Why did you bring him here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive 
                me...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away 
                from the door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes 
                later little black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father's pet, 
                having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma 
                was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. 
                The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door, went 
                up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, 
                and having examined the position of her father, who was asleep 
                with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which 
                lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his 
                face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha, Natasha!&quot; came Countess Mary's frightened 
                whisper from the door. &quot;Papa wants to sleep.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Mamma, he doesn't want to sleep,&quot; said little 
                Natasha with conviction. &quot;He's laughing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in 
                his arms.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come in, Mary,&quot; he said to his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　She went in and sat down by her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did not notice him following me,&quot; she said timidly. 
                &quot;I just looked in.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at 
                his wife and, seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm 
                around her and kissed her hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I kiss Mamma?&quot; he asked Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha smiled bashfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Again!&quot; she commanded, pointing with a peremptory 
                gesture to the spot where Nicholas had placed the kiss.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know why you think I am cross,&quot; said Nicholas, 
                replying to the question he knew was in his wife's mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when 
                you are like that. It always seems to me... &quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary, don't talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of 
                yourself!&quot; he said gaily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It seems to be that you can't love me, that I am so 
                plain... always... and now... in this cond...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, 
                it's love that makes us see beauty. It is only Malvinas and women 
                of that kind who are loved for their beauty. But do I love my 
                wife? I don't love her, but... I don't know how to put it. Without 
                you, or when something comes between us like this, I seem lost 
                and can't do anything. Now do I love my finger? I don't love it, 
                but just try to cut it off!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm not like that myself, but I understand. So you're 
                not angry with me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Awfully angry!&quot; he said, smiling and getting up. 
                And smoothing his hair he began to pace the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, Mary, what I've been thinking?&quot; he 
                began, immediately thinking aloud in his wife's presence now that 
                they had made it up.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not 
                care. A thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her 
                also. And he told her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay 
                with them till spring.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, 
                and in her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about 
                the children.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can see the woman in her already,&quot; she said 
                in French, pointing to little Natasha. &quot;You reproach us women 
                with being illogical. Here is our logic. I say: 'Papa wants to 
                sleep!' but she says, 'No, he's laughing.' And she was right,&quot; 
                said Countess Mary with a happy smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; And Nicholas, taking his little daughter 
                in his strong hand, lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, 
                held her by the legs, and paced the room with her. There was an 
                expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and 
                daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of 
                this one,&quot; his wife whispered in French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and 
                footsteps in the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Somebody has come.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,&quot; said 
                Countess Mary and left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little 
                daughter a gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing 
                child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. 
                His capers reminded him of dancing, and looking at the child's 
                round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when 
                he was an old man, taking her into society and dancing the mazurka 
                with her as his old father had danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is he, it is he, Nicholas!&quot; said Countess Mary, 
                re-entering the room a few minutes later. &quot;Now our Natasha 
                has come to life. You should have seen her ecstasy, and how he 
                caught it for having stayed away so long. Well, come along now, 
                quick, quick! It's time you two were parted,&quot; she added, 
                looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should never, never have believed that one could be 
                so happy,&quot; she whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face 
                but at the same time she sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a 
                quiet sadness as though she felt, through her happiness, that 
                there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and 
                of which she involuntarily thought at that instant.</p>

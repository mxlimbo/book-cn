              <p> 　　From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with 
                Natasha's grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet 
                that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new 
                was appearing on his own horizon- from that day the problem of 
                the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly 
                tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question 
                &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Wherefore?&quot; which had come to him 
                amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question 
                or by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When he 
                listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when 
                he read or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified 
                as formerly, and did not ask himself why men struggled so about 
                these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible- but 
                he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts 
                vanished- not because she had answered the questions that had 
                haunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him 
                instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity 
                in which no one could be justified or guilty- a realm of beauty 
                and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness 
                presented itself to him, he said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, 
                and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does 
                that matter? She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, 
                and I love her, and no one will ever know it.&quot; And his soul 
                felt calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the 
                same idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent 
                at the Rostovs' there were other hours he had to spend somehow, 
                and the habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed 
                a current that bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when 
                more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and 
                Natasha's health began to improve and she no longer aroused in 
                him the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, 
                which he could not explain, took possession of him. He felt that 
                the condition he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe 
                was coming which would change his whole life, and he impatiently 
                sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One 
                of his brother Masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy 
                concerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation of St. John.</p>
              <p> 　　In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said: </p>
              <p> 　　Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the 
                number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
                is Six hundred threescore and six. And in the fifth verse of the 
                same chapter: </p>
              <p> 　　And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things 
                and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty 
                and two months. </p>
              <p> 　　The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values 
                as the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and 
                the others tens, will have the following significance: </p>
              <p> 　　　a　　 b　　 c　　 d　　 e　　 f　　 g　　 h　　 i　　 k</p>
              <p>

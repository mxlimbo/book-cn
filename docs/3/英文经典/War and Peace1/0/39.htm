                first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to 
                be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister 
                of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night's 
                conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full 
                parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went 
                into Bilibin's study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand 
                bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. 
                With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy, 
                Bolkonski was already acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the 
                others.</p>
              <p> 　　The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin's were young, wealthy, 
                gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set 
                which Bilibin, their leader, called les notres.* This set, consisting 
                almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests 
                which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high 
                society, to certain women, and to the official side of the service. 
                These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an 
                honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to start 
                conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and 
                the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*Ours. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But the best of it was,&quot; said one, telling of the 
                misfortune of a fellow diplomat, &quot;that the Chancellor told 
                him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and 
                that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But the worst of it, gentlemen- I am giving Kuragin 
                away to you- is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked 
                fellow, is taking advantage of it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs 
                over its arm. He began to laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell me about that!&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!&quot; cried several voices.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You, Bolkonski, don't know,&quot; said Bilibin turning 
                to Prince Andrew, &quot;that all the atrocities of the French 
                army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared 
                to what this man has been doing among the women!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;La femme est la compagne de l'homme,&quot;* announced 
                Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his 
                elevated legs. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Woman is man's companion.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin and the rest of &quot;ours&quot; burst out laughing 
                in Hippolyte's face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of 
                whom- he had to admit- he had almost been jealous on his wife's 
                account, was the butt of this set.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I must give you a treat,&quot; Bilibin whispered 
                to Bolkonski. &quot;Kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics- 
                you should see his gravity!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began 
                talking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered 
                round these two.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,&quot; 
                began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, &quot;without 
                expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, 
                unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of 
                our alliance...</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait, I have not finished...&quot; he said to Prince 
                Andrew, seizing him by the arm, &quot;I believe that intervention 
                will be stronger than nonintervention. And...&quot; he paused. 
                &quot;Finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch 
                of November 18. That is how it will end.&quot; And he released 
                Bolkonski's arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest 
                in thy golden mouth!&quot; said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on 
                his head moved with satisfaction.</p>
              <p> 　　Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was 
                evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain 
                the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well now, gentlemen,&quot; said Bilibin, &quot;Bolkonski 
                is my guest in this house and in Brunn itself. I want to entertain 
                him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we 
                were in Vienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian 
                hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to help me. Brunn's 
                attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater, 
                I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We must let him see Amelie, she's exquisite!&quot; said 
                one of &quot;ours,&quot; kissing his finger tips.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to 
                more humane interests,&quot; said Bilibin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, 
                gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,&quot; replied Prince 
                Andrew looking at his watch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the Emperor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; Well, au revoir, Bolkonski! Au revoir, 
                Prince! Come back early to dinner,&quot; cried several voices. 
                &quot;We'll take you in hand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can 
                to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes 
                indicated,&quot; said Bilibin, accompanying him to the hall.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I 
                the facts, I can't,&quot; replied Bolkonski, smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion 
                for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and 
                can't do it, as you will see.&quot; </p>

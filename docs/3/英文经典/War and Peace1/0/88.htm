              <p> 　　Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch 
                Pierre, not the Rhetor but Pierre's sponsor, Willarski, whom he 
                recognized by his voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness 
                of his resolution Pierre replied: &quot;Yes, yes, I agree,&quot; 
                and with a beaming, childlike smile, his fat chest uncovered, 
                stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted 
                foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. 
                He was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards 
                and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the Lodge. 
                Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, 
                the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfold) 
                questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was born, and 
                so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfold, and as 
                they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage, 
                of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the universe, 
                and of the courage with which he should endure toils and dangers. 
                During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of 
                now as the &quot;Seeker,&quot; now as the &quot;Sufferer,&quot; 
                and now as the &quot;Postulant,&quot; to the accompaniment of 
                various knockings with mallets and swords. As he was being led 
                up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among 
                his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers 
                and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain 
                carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed it on something, 
                and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with 
                the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath 
                of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then extinguished 
                and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was 
                told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was taken 
                off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, 
                as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing aprons 
                like the Rhetor's and holding swords in their hands pointed at 
                his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained 
                with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast 
                toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were 
                drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now thou hast seen the lesser light,&quot; uttered a 
                voice. Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would 
                see the full light; the bandage was again removed and more than 
                ten voices said together: &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about 
                at the room and at the people in it. Round a long table covered 
                with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already 
                seen. Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the 
                President's chair sat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar 
                cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abbe 
                whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna's two years before. There 
                were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who 
                had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins'. All maintained a solemn 
                silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a mallet 
                in his hand. Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one 
                side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked 
                upon it, at the other was something resembling an altar on which 
                lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large candlesticks 
                like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre up 
                to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie 
                down, saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the 
                Temple.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He must first receive the trowel,&quot; whispered one 
                of the brothers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, hush, please!&quot; said another.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes 
                without obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. &quot;Where 
                am I? What am I doing? Aren't they laughing at me? Shan't I be 
                ashamed to remember this?&quot; But these doubts only lasted a 
                moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around, remembered 
                all he had already gone through, and realized that he could not 
                stop halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation and, trying to arouse 
                his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself before the Gates 
                of the Temple. And really, the feeling of devotion returned to 
                him even more strongly than before. When he had lain there some 
                time, he was told to get up, and a white leather apron, such as 
                the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel and three 
                pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He told 
                him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of 
                that apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the 
                unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his 
                own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart 
                of his neighbor. As to the first pair of gloves, a man's, he said 
                that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The 
                second pair of man's gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and 
                finally of the third, a pair of women's gloves, he said: &quot;Dear 
                brother, these woman's gloves are intended for you too. Give them 
                to the woman whom you shall honor most of all. This gift will 
                be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to 
                be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.&quot; And after a pause, he 
                added: &quot;But beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not 
                deck hands that are unclean.&quot; While the Grand Master said 
                these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. 
                Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a child 
                till tears came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily, 
                and an awkward pause followed.</p>
              <p> 　　This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre 
                up to the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book 
                an explanation of all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a 
                hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, 
                a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then a place was assigned 
                to Pierre, he was shown the signs of the Lodge, told the password, 
                and at last was permitted to sit down. The Grand Master began 
                reading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierre, from joy, 
                agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to understand 
                what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words 
                of the statutes and these remained in his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,&quot; 
                read the Grand Master, &quot;but those between virtue and vice. 
                Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality. 
                Fly to a brother's aid whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth 
                astray, raise him that falleth, never bear malice or enmity toward 
                thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all hearts the 
                flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may 
                envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do 
                not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling the 
                highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which 
                thou hast lost.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, 
                with tears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how 
                to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances 
                that met him on all sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but 
                saw in all these men only brothers, and burned with impatience 
                to set to work with them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat 
                down in their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the 
                necessity of humility.</p>
              <p> 　　The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed, 
                and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of &quot;Collector 
                of Alms&quot; went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have 
                liked to subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look 
                like pride subscribed the same amount as the others.</p>
              <p> 　　The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt 
                as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent 
                dozens of years, had become completely changed, and had quite 
                left behind his former habits and way of life.</p>

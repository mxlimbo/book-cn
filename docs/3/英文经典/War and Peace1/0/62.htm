              <p> 　　That same night, Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing 
                duty in front of Bagration's detachment. His hussars were placed 
                along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying 
                to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous 
                space, with our army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could 
                be seen behind him; in front of him was misty darkness. Rostov 
                could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance: 
                now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now 
                little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now 
                he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept 
                closing, and in his fancy appeared- now the Emperor, now Denisov, 
                and now Moscow memories- and he again hurriedly opened his eyes 
                and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was 
                riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, 
                the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the 
                same misty darkness. &quot;Why not?... It might easily happen,&quot; 
                thought Rostov, &quot;that the Emperor will meet me and give me 
                an order as he would to any other officer; he'll say: 'Go and 
                find out what's there.' There are many stories of his getting 
                to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him 
                to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would 
                guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask 
                his deceivers!&quot; And in order to realize vividly his love 
                devotion to the sovereign, Rostov pictured to himself an enemy 
                or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure 
                but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly 
                a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass 
                and watchword- shaft, Olmutz. What a nuisance that our squadron 
                will be in reserve tomorrow,&quot; he thought. &quot;I'll ask 
                leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing 
                the Emperor. It won't be long now before I am off duty. I'll take 
                another turn and when I get back I'll go to the general and ask 
                him.&quot; He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up 
                his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him 
                that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent 
                lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a 
                wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostov could 
                not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the 
                moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought 
                something moved on that white spot. &quot;I expect it's snow... 
                that spot... a spot- une tache,&quot; he thought. &quot;There 
                now... it's not a tache... Natasha... sister, black eyes... Na... 
                tasha... (Won't she be surprised when I tell her how I've seen 
                the Emperor?) Natasha... take my sabretache...&quot;- &quot;Keep 
                to the right, your honor, there are bushes here,&quot; came the 
                voice of an hussar, past whom Rostov was riding in the act of 
                falling asleep. Rostov lifted his head that had sunk almost to 
                his horse's mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing 
                to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. &quot;But what 
                was I thinking? I mustn't forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? 
                No, that's not it- that's tomorrow. Oh yes! Natasha... sabretache... 
                saber them...Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. 
                Along the Tverskaya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I 
                thought about him too, just opposite Guryev's house... Old Guryev.... 
                Oh, but Denisov's a fine fellow. But that's all nonsense. The 
                chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and 
                wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared 
                not. But that's nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the 
                important thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tasha, sabretache, 
                oh, yes, yes! That's right!&quot; And his head once more sank 
                to his horse's neck. All at once it seemed to him that he was 
                being fired at. &quot;What? What? What?... Cut them down! What?...&quot; 
                said Rostov, waking up. At the moment he opened his eyes his eyes 
                he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn 
                shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the 
                hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, 
                where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, 
                then another, and all along the French line on the hill fires 
                flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rostov could 
                hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them. 
                The din of many voices was too great; all he could hear was: &quot;ahahah!&quot; 
                and &quot;rrrr!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's that? What do you make of it?&quot; said Rostov 
                to the hussar beside him. &quot;That must be the enemy's camp!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hussar did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, don't you hear it?&quot; Rostov asked again, after 
                waiting for a reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who can tell, your honor?&quot; replied the hussar reluctantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From the direction, it must be the enemy,&quot; repeated 
                Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It may be he or it may be nothing,&quot; muttered the 
                hussar. &quot;It's dark... Steady!&quot; he cried to his fidgeting 
                horse.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov's horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen 
                ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. 
                The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar 
                that only an army of several thousand men could produce. The lights 
                spread farther and farther, probably along the line of the French 
                camp. Rostov no longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting 
                of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him. &quot;Vive 
                l'Empereur! L'Empereur!&quot; he now heard distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They can't be far off, probably just beyond the stream,&quot; 
                he said to the hussar beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. 
                The sound of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line 
                of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure 
                of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an 
                elephant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor, the generals!&quot; said the sergeant, riding 
                up to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, 
                rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding 
                along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and 
                Prince Dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the 
                curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy's camp. 
                Rostov rode up to Bagration, reported to him, and then joined 
                the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Believe me,&quot; said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing 
                Bagration, &quot;it is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and 
                ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive 
                us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hardly,&quot; said Bagration. &quot;I saw them this 
                evening on that knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn 
                from that too.... Officer!&quot; said Bagration to Rostov, &quot;are 
                the enemy's skirmishers still there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They were there this evening, but now I don't know, 
                your excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?&quot; 
                replied Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostov's 
                face in the mist.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, go and see,&quot; he said, after a pause.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and 
                two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill 
                in the direction from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened 
                and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious 
                and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him. 
                Bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, 
                but Rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode 
                on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies 
                for men and continually discovering his mistakes. Having descended 
                the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy's 
                fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. 
                In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but when 
                he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the 
                road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along 
                it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. 
                To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have 
                been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along 
                it. &quot;Follow me!&quot; said he, crossed the road, and began 
                riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the French 
                pickets had been standing that evening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor, there he is!&quot; cried one of the hussars 
                behind him. And before Rostov had time to make out what the black 
                thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, 
                followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist 
                with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed 
                fire but flashed in the pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped 
                back. Four more reports followed at intervals, and the bullets 
                passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones. Rostov 
                reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at 
                the firing, and went back at a footpace. &quot;Well, some more! 
                Some more!&quot; a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no 
                more shots came.</p>
              <p> 　　Only when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop 
                again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated 
                and had only lit fires to deceive us.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does that prove?&quot; he was saying as Rostov 
                rode up. &quot;They might retreat and leave the pickets.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,&quot; 
                said Bagration. &quot;Wait till tomorrow morning, we'll find out 
                everything tomorrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just 
                where it was in the evening,&quot; reported Rostov, stooping forward 
                with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of 
                delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the 
                bullets.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very good, very good,&quot; said Bagration. &quot;Thank 
                you, officer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency,&quot; said Rostov, &quot;may I ask 
                a favor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask 
                to be attached to the first squadron?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Rostov.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Ilya Rostov's son?&quot; asked Dolgorukov.</p>
              <p> 　　But Rostov did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will give the order.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message 
                to the Emperor,&quot; thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned 
                by the fact that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read 
                to the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The 
                soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, 
                shouting, &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; Napoleon's proclamation 
                was as follows: </p>
              <p> 　　Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge 
                the Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke 
                at Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position 
                we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round 
                me on the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will 
                myself direct your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you 
                with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the 
                enemy's ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, 
                you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows 
                of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, especially 
                on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, 
                so necessary to the honor of our nation.</p>
              <p> 　　Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! 
                Let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat 
                these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! 
                This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter 
                quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France 
                will join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of 
                my people, of you, and of myself.</p>

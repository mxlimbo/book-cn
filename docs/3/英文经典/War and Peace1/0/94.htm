              <p> 　　Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre 
                went to the Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of 
                serfs, taking with him full directions which he had written down 
                for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates.</p>
              <p> 　　When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head 
                office and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told 
                them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs- 
                and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor, 
                women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work, 
                assistance was to be given to the serfs, punishments were to be 
                admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals, asylums, and schools 
                were to be established on all the estates. Some of the stewards 
                (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with alarm, 
                supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased 
                with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their 
                first fright were amused by Pierre's lisp and the new words they 
                had not heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master 
                talked, while the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, 
                understood from this speech how they could best handle the master 
                for their own ends.</p>
              <p> 　　The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre's intentions, 
                but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary 
                to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.</p>
              <p> 　　Despite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, since he had come 
                into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand 
                rubles a year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father 
                had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim 
                perception of the following budget:</p>
              <p> 　　About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land 
                Bank, about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, 
                the town house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 
                15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 
                150,000 alimony was sent to the countess; about 70,00 went for 
                interest on debts. The building of a new church, previously begun, 
                had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and he did 
                not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost 
                every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward 
                wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of 
                the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first 
                task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude 
                or inclination- practical business.</p>
              <p> 　　He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. 
                But he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt 
                that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did 
                not link up with them or make them move. On the one hand, the 
                chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst 
                light, pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and 
                undertaking new activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did 
                not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should 
                be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by showing 
                the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank, 
                and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.</p>
              <p> 　　The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested 
                selling the forests in the province of Kostroma, the land lower 
                down the river, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: 
                all of which operations according to him were connected with such 
                complicated measures- the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, 
                and so on- that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, do so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have 
                enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked 
                it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending 
                to it. The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count 
                that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor 
                and troublesome to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened 
                to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, 
                the largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre's 
                greatest weakness- the one to which he had confessed when admitted 
                to the Lodge- were so strong that he could not resist them. Again 
                whole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a 
                rush and were as much occupied with evening parties, dinners, 
                lunches, and balls, giving him no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. 
                Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the 
                old life, only in new surroundings.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that 
                he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an 
                example of moral life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked 
                two- morality and the love of death. He consoled himself with 
                the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts- that of 
                reforming the human race- and had other virtues- love of his neighbor, 
                and especially generosity.</p>
              <p> 　　In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. 
                On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself 
                how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were 
                the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended 
                to benefit.</p>
              <p> 　　The chief steward, who considered the young count's attempts 
                almost insane- unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the 
                serfs- made some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation 
                of the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of 
                large buildings- schools, hospitals, and asylums- on all the estates 
                before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not 
                for ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), 
                but for just such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of 
                icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to 
                his understanding of his master, would touch and delude him.</p>
              <p> 　　The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a 
                Vienna carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening 
                effect on Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each 
                more picturesque than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving 
                and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere 
                were receptions, which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened 
                a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one place the peasants 
                presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and 
                Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for 
                the benefits he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry 
                to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, 
                his patron saints. In another place the women with infants in 
                arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work. On 
                a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded 
                by children whom, by the count's generosity, he was instructing 
                in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre saw 
                with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection, 
                all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which 
                were soon to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards' accounts, 
                according to which the serfs' manorial labor had been diminished, 
                and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their 
                full-skirted blue coats.</p>
              <p> 　　What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented 
                him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor 
                of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on 
                St. Peter's day, and that the richest peasants (who formed the 
                deputation) had begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths 
                of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest 
                poverty. He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no 
                longer sent to work on his land, they did still harder work on 
                their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with 
                the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and that the 
                pupils' parents wept at having to let him take their children 
                and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that 
                the brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs 
                whose manorial labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. 
                He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts 
                that the serfs' payments had been diminished by a third, their 
                obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half. And so 
                Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered 
                the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote 
                enthusiastic letters to his &quot;brother-instructor&quot; as 
                he called the Grand Master.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so 
                much good,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;and how little attention 
                we pay to it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed 
                at receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more 
                he might do for these simple, kindly people.</p>
              <p> 　　The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly 
                through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as 
                with a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had 
                on Pierre, pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility 
                and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite 
                happy as it was.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it 
                would be difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only 
                knew what would happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, 
                though reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised 
                to do all in his power to carry out the count's wishes, seeing 
                clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out 
                whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and 
                forests and to release them from the Land Bank, but would probably 
                never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected 
                buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to 
                give in money and work all that other people's serfs gave- that 
                is to say, all that could be got out of them.</p>

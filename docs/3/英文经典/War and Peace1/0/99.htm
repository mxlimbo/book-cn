              <p> 　　When returning from his leave, Rostov felt, for the first 
                time, how close was the bond that united him to Denisov and and 
                the whole regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　On approaching it, Rostov felt as he had done when approaching 
                his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned 
                uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dementyev 
                and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrushka gleefully 
                shouted to his master, &quot;The count has come!&quot; and Denisov, 
                who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the 
                mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet 
                the new arrival, Rostov experienced the same feeling his mother, 
                his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy 
                choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a 
                home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents' house.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment 
                and had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty 
                and had gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all 
                the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived 
                of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced 
                the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense 
                being at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the 
                parental roof. But here was none of all that turmoil of the world 
                at large, where he did not know his right place and took mistaken 
                decisions; here was no Sonya with whom he ought, or ought not, 
                to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there 
                or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the 
                day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was 
                not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer 
                to him or farther from him than another; there were none of those 
                uncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and nothing 
                to recall that terrible loss to Dolokhov. Here, in the regiment, 
                all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two 
                unequal parts: one, our Pavlograd regiment; the other, all the 
                rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything 
                was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good 
                fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The 
                canteenkeeper gave one credit, one's pay came every four months, 
                there was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing 
                that was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and, when given 
                an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered- 
                and all would be well.</p>
              <p> 　　Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this 
                regimental life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels 
                on lying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, 
                was all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to Dolokhov 
                (for which, in spite of all his family's efforts to console him, 
                he could not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone 
                for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really 
                well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer- 
                in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so 
                difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to 
                his parents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, 
                but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest 
                to repay the debt to his parents.</p>
              <p> 　　Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles 
                at Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. 
                It was awaiting the Emperor's arrival and the beginning of a new 
                campaign.</p>
              <p> 　　The Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army 
                which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up 
                to strength in Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the 
                first actions of the campaign. It had been neither at Pultusk 
                nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined the army in the field 
                in the second half of the campaign, was attached to Platov's division.</p>
              <p> 　　Platov's division was acting independently of the main army. 
                Several times parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots 
                with the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured 
                Marshal Oudinot's carriages. In April the Pavlograds were stationed 
                immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German 
                village.</p>
              <p> 　　A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river 
                broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions 
                for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports 
                could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted 
                villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled- 
                if any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more 
                could be taken from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless 
                enough, instead of taking anything from them, often gave them 
                the last of their rations.</p>
              <p> 　　The Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, 
                but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In 
                the hospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering from 
                fever, or the swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain 
                on duty, and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front 
                rather than to the hospitals. When spring came on, the soldiers 
                found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like 
                asparagus, which, for some reason, they called &quot;Mashka's 
                sweet root.&quot; It was very bitter, but they wandered about 
                the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate 
                it, though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious 
                plant. That spring a new disease broke out broke out among the 
                soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, which the doctors 
                attributed to eating this root. But in spite of all this, the 
                soldiers of Denisov's squadron fed chiefly on &quot;Mashka's sweet 
                root,&quot; because it was the second week that the last of the 
                biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man 
                and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.</p>
              <p> 　　The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from 
                the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still 
                covered with tufts of felty winter hair.</p>
              <p> 　　Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on 
                living just as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered 
                uniforms, the hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in 
                order, groomed their horses, polished their arms, brought in straw 
                from the thatched roofs in place of fodder, and sat down to dine 
                round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking about 
                their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, 
                they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before them naked; smoked, 
                picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened 
                to stories of Potemkin's and Suvorov's campaigns, or to legends 
                of Alesha the Sly, or the priest's laborer Mikolka.</p>
              <p> 　　The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, 
                half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes 
                and, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves 
                as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though 
                there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits 
                and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken 
                of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly 
                because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going 
                badly.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov lived, as before, with Denisov, and since their furlough 
                they had become more friendly than ever. Denisov never spoke of 
                Rostov's family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed 
                him, Rostov felt that the elder hussar's luckless love for Natasha 
                played a part in strengthening their friendship. Denisov evidently 
                tried to expose Rostov to danger as seldom as possible, and after 
                an action greeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of 
                his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to 
                which he had come in search of provisions, Rostov found a family 
                consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. 
                They were half clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and 
                had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rostov brought them to 
                his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and kept them for 
                some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his comrades, 
                talking of women, began chaffing Rostov, saying that he was more 
                wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if 
                he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. Rostov 
                took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant 
                things to the officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent 
                a duel. When the officer had gone away, Denisov, who did not himself 
                know what Rostov's relations with the Polish girl might be, began 
                to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and Rostov replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and 
                I can't tell you how it offended me... because... well, for that 
                reason....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing 
                the room without looking at Rostov, as was his way at moments 
                of deep feeling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!&quot; he muttered, 
                and Rostov noticed tears in his eyes. </p>

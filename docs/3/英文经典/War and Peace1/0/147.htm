              <p> 　　At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkonski and his 
                daughter moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor 
                Alexander's regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French 
                tendency prevailed there, and this, together with his past and 
                his intellect and his originality, at once made Prince Nicholas 
                Bolkonski an object of particular respect to the Moscovites and 
                the center of the Moscow opposition to the government.</p>
              <p> 　　The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked 
                signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness 
                of quite recent events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish 
                vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. 
                In spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike 
                a feeling of respectful veneration- especially of an evening when 
                he came in to tea in his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, 
                aroused by anyone, told his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered 
                yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present. For them 
                all, that old-fashioned house with its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution 
                furniture, powdered footmen, and the stern shrewd old man (himself 
                a relic of the past century) with his gentle daughter and the 
                pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented 
                a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors did not reflect 
                that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host, 
                there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the private 
                and intimate life of the house continued.</p>
              <p> 　　Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess 
                Mary. There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures- 
                talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at 
                Bald Hills- and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of 
                city life. She did not go out into society; everyone knew that 
                her father would not let her go anywhere without him, and his 
                failing health prevented his going out himself, so that she was 
                not invited to dinners and evening parties. She had quite abandoned 
                the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness and malevolence 
                with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men, 
                possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She had 
                no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed 
                in the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                with whom she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become 
                unpleasant to her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided 
                her. Julie, with whom she had corresponded for the last five years, 
                was in Moscow, but proved to be quite alien to her when they met. 
                Just then Julie, who by the death of her brothers had become one 
                of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the full whirl of society 
                pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she fancied, had 
                suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at that stage 
                in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance 
                of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or 
                never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile 
                that she now had no one to write to, since Julie- whose presence 
                gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the 
                old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent 
                his evenings for years, she regretted Julie's presence and having 
                no one to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk 
                to, no one to whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell 
                to her lot just then. The time for Prince Andrew's return and 
                marriage was approaching, but his request to her to prepare his 
                father for it had not been carried out; in fact, it seemed as 
                if matters were quite hopeless, for at every mention of the young 
                Countess Rostova the old prince (who apart from that was usually 
                in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another lately added 
                sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew. 
                To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little 
                Nicholas some symptoms of her father's irritability. However often 
                she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching 
                her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down 
                to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own 
                knowledge quickly and easily into the child- who was already afraid 
                that Auntie might at any moment get angry- that at his slightest 
                inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated, raised 
                her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in 
                the corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin 
                to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following 
                her example, would sob, and without permission would leave his 
                corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort 
                her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father's 
                irritability, which was always directed against her and had of 
                late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself 
                to the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood 
                or water, it would never have entered her mind to think her position 
                hard; but this loving despot- the more cruel because he loved 
                her and for that reason tormented himself and her- knew how not 
                merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately, but to show her 
                that she was always to blame for everything. Of late he had exhibited 
                a new trait that tormented Princess Mary more than anything else; 
                this was his ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. 
                The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his 
                son's intentions had occurred to him in jest- that if Andrew got 
                married he himself would marry Bourienne- had evidently pleased 
                him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it seemed to Princess 
                Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments to the companion 
                and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations 
                of love of Bourienne.</p>
              <p> 　　One day in Moscow in Princess Mary's presence (she thought 
                her father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince 
                kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand and, drawing her to him, 
                embraced her affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out 
                of the room. A few minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into 
                Princess Mary's room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her 
                agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went 
                resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious 
                of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, 
                her voice breaking: &quot;It's horrible, vile, inhuman, to take 
                advantage of the weakness...&quot; She did not finish. &quot;Leave 
                my room,&quot; she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but 
                she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                should be served first. After dinner, when the footman handed 
                coffee and from habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly 
                grew furious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions 
                to have him conscripted for the army.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He doesn't obey... I said it twice... and he doesn't 
                obey! She is the first person in this house; she's my best friend,&quot; 
                cried the prince. &quot;And if you allow yourself,&quot; he screamed 
                in a fury, addressing Princess Mary for the first time, &quot;to 
                forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday, 
                I will show you who is master in this house. Go! Don't let me 
                set eyes on you; beg her pardon!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne's pardon, and also 
                her father's pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who 
                had begged for her intervention.</p>
              <p> 　　At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered 
                in her soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would 
                look for his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and 
                not seeing them, or would forget something that had just occurred, 
                or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if 
                anyone had noticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner 
                when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall 
                asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over 
                his plate. &quot;He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!&quot; 
                she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against 
                herself. </p>

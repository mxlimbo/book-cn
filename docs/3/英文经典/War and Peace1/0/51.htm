              <p> 　　In November, 1805, Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of inspection 
                in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself 
                so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick 
                up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take 
                him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkonski in order to arrange a match 
                for him with the daughter of that rich old man. But before leaving 
                home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasili had to settle 
                matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole 
                days at home, that is, in Prince Vasili's house where he was staying, 
                and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in Helene's presence 
                (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is all very fine, but things must be settled,&quot; 
                said Prince Vasili to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, 
                feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him (&quot;But 
                never mind that&quot;) was not behaving very well in this matter. 
                &quot;Youth, frivolity... well, God be with him,&quot; thought 
                he, relishing his own goodness of heart, &quot;but it must be 
                brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be Lelya's name 
                day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand 
                what he ought to do then it will be my affair- yes, my affair. 
                I am her father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna's &quot;At Home&quot; and after 
                the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry Helene would 
                be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, 
                despite that decision, had not left Prince Vasili's and felt with 
                terror that in people's eyes he was every day more and more connected 
                with her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former 
                conception of her, that he could not break away from her, and 
                that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite 
                his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able to free himself 
                but that Prince Vasili (who had rarely before given receptions) 
                now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at 
                which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general 
                pleasure and disappoint everyone's expectation. Prince Vasili, 
                in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre's hand 
                in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out 
                his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would 
                say: &quot;Till tomorrow,&quot; or, &quot;Be in to dinner or I 
                shall not see you,&quot; or, &quot;I am staying in for your sake,&quot; 
                and so on. And though Prince Vasili, when he stayed in (as he 
                said) for Pierre's sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with 
                him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to 
                himself one and the same thing: &quot;It is time I understood 
                her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken before, 
                or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent 
                girl,&quot; he sometimes said to himself &quot;she never makes 
                a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little, but what 
                she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. 
                She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be 
                a bad woman!&quot; He had often begun to make reflections or think 
                aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by 
                a brief but appropriate remark- showing that it did not interest 
                her- or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything 
                else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in regarding 
                all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.</p>
              <p> 　　She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile 
                meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant 
                than in the general smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre 
                knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross 
                a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would step 
                across it, but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought 
                of that dreadful step. A thousand times during that month and 
                a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful 
                abyss, Pierre said to himself: &quot;What am I doing? I need resolution. 
                Can it be that I have none?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in 
                this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known 
                in himself and really possessed. Pierre was one of those who are 
                only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent, and since 
                that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while 
                stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pavlovna's, an unacknowledged 
                sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.</p>
              <p> 　　On Helene's name day, a small party of just their own people- 
                as his wife said- met for supper at Prince Vasili's. All these 
                friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate 
                of the young girl would be decided that evening. The visitors 
                were seated at supper. Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman 
                who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table. 
                On either side of her sat the more important guests- an old general 
                and his wife, and Anna Pavlovna Scherer. At the other end sat 
                the younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members 
                of the family, and Pierre and Helene, side by side. Prince Vasili 
                was not having any supper: he went round the table in a merry 
                mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests. 
                To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except 
                to Pierre and Helene, whose presence he seemed not to notice. 
                He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, 
                the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies' toilets and 
                the gold and silver of the men's epaulets; servants in scarlet 
                liveries moved round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, 
                and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations. 
                At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring 
                an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she laughed; 
                at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some 
                Mary Viktorovna or other. At the center of the table, Prince Vasili 
                attracted everybody's attention. With a facetious smile on his 
                face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's meeting 
                of the Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, 
                the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received 
                and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from 
                the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that he 
                was receiving from all sides declarations of the people's loyalty, 
                that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, 
                and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would 
                endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: 
                &quot;Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me,&quot; etc.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and so he never got farther than: 'Sergey Kuzmich'?&quot; 
                asked one of the ladies.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther,&quot; answered 
                Prince Vasili, laughing, &quot;'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides... 
                From all sides... Sergey Kuzmich...' Poor Vyazmitinov could not 
                get any farther! He began the rescript again and again, but as 
                soon as he uttered 'Sergey' he sobbed, 'Kuz-mi-ch,' tears, and 
                'From all sides' was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. 
                And again his handkerchief, and again: 'Sergey Kuzmich, From all 
                sides,'... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to 
                read it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears,&quot; someone 
                repeated laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't be unkind,&quot; cried Anna Pavlovna from her 
                end of the table holding up a threatening finger. &quot;He is 
                such a worthy and excellent man, our dear Vyazmitinov....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, 
                where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits 
                and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only 
                Pierre and Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom 
                of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, 
                a smile that had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich- a smile of 
                bashfulness at their own feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, 
                talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, 
                and ices, and however they avoided looking at the young couple, 
                and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one could 
                feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about 
                Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, 
                and that the whole attention of that company was directed to- 
                Pierre and Helene. Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing of Sergey 
                Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, 
                and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said: 
                &quot;Yes... it's getting on, it will all be settled today.&quot; 
                Anna Pavlovna threatened him on behalf of &quot;our dear Vyazmitinov,&quot; 
                and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince 
                Vasili read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his 
                daughter's happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered 
                some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her 
                daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: &quot;Yes, there's nothing 
                left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the 
                time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly, provocatively 
                happy.&quot; &quot;And what nonsense all this is that I am saying!&quot; 
                thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. 
                &quot;That's happiness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests 
                uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction 
                of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another. 
                And this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above 
                all their affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, 
                and the animation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but 
                even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they 
                forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful Helene with 
                her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy 
                face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the candles 
                was focused on those two happy faces alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre felt that he the center of it all, and this both pleased 
                and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some 
                occupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. 
                Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world 
                of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it is all finished!&quot; he thought. &quot;And how 
                has it all happened? How quickly! Now I know that not because 
                of her alone, nor of myself alone, but because of everyone, it 
                must inevitably come about. They are all expecting it, they are 
                so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint 
                them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly 
                happen!&quot; thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders 
                close to his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He 
                felt it awkward to attract everyone's attention and to be considered 
                a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort 
                of Paris possessed of a Helen. &quot;But no doubt it always is 
                and must be so!&quot; he consoled himself. &quot;And besides, 
                what have I done to bring it about? How did it begin? I traveled 
                from Moscow with Prince Vasili. Then there was nothing. So why 
                should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and 
                picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, 
                when did it all come about?&quot; And here he was sitting by her 
                side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, 
                her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly 
                seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, 
                and that that was why they all looked so at him, and flattered 
                by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his 
                head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar 
                voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was 
                so absorbed that he did not understand what was said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski,&quot; 
                repeated Prince Vasili a third time. &quot;How absent-minded you 
                are, my dear fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was 
                smiling at him and Helene. &quot;Well, what of it, if you all 
                know it?&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;What of it? It's the truth!&quot; 
                and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and Helene smiled 
                too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?&quot; 
                repeated Prince Vasili, who pretended to want to know this in 
                order to settle a dispute.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can one talk or think of such trifles?&quot; thought 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, from Olmutz,&quot; he answered, with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into 
                the drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking 
                leave of Helene. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an 
                important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste 
                to go away, refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist 
                preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured 
                the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's 
                happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked 
                how his leg was. &quot;Oh, the old fool,&quot; he thought. &quot;That 
                Princess Helene will be beautiful still when she's fifty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think I may congratulate you,&quot; whispered Anna 
                Pavlovna to the old princess, kissing her soundly. &quot;If I 
                hadn't this headache I'd have stayed longer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy 
                of her daughter's happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for 
                a long time alone with Helene in the little drawing room where 
                they were sitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, 
                remained alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. 
                Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his 
                mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he 
                was occupying someone else's place here beside Helene. &quot;This 
                happiness is not for you,&quot; some inner voice whispered to 
                him. &quot;This happiness is for those who have not in them what 
                there is in you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether 
                she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple 
                manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest 
                she had ever had.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were 
                sitting in the large drawing room. Prince Vasili came up to Pierre 
                with languid footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. 
                Prince Vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what 
                Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it 
                in. But then the expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre's 
                hand downwards, made him sit down, and smiled affectionately.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Lelya?&quot; he asked, turning instantly to his 
                daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual 
                tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from 
                babyhood, but which Prince Vasili had only acquired by imitating 
                other parents.</p>
              <p> 　　And he again turned to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sergey Kuzmich- From all sides-&quot; he said, unbuttoning 
                the top button of his waistcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not 
                the story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just 
                then, and Prince Vasili saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly 
                muttered something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even 
                the prince was disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of 
                that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked at Helene 
                and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say: &quot;Well, 
                it is your own fault.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!&quot; 
                thought Pierre, and he again began speaking about indifferent 
                matters, about Sergey Kuzmich, asking what the point of the story 
                was as he had not heard it properly. Helene answered with a smile 
                that she too had missed it.</p>
              <p> 　　When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the princess, 
                his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, 
                my dear...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marriages are made in heaven,&quot; replied the elderly 
                lady.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and 
                sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his 
                eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he 
                roused himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aline,&quot; he said to his wife, &quot;go and see what 
                they are about.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified 
                and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. 
                Pierre and Helene still sat talking just as before.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still the same,&quot; she said to her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered 
                and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar 
                to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with 
                resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room. 
                With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so 
                unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God!&quot; said Prince Vasili. &quot;My wife has 
                told me everything!- (He put one arm around Pierre and the other 
                around his daughter.)- &quot;My dear boy... Lelya... I am very 
                pleased.&quot; (His voice trembled.) &quot;I loved your father... 
                and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed 
                him with his malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess, come here!&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was 
                using her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the 
                beautiful Helene's hand several times. After a while they were 
                left alone again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All this had to be and could not be otherwise,&quot; 
                thought Pierre, &quot;so it is useless to ask whether it is good 
                or bad. It is good because it's definite and one is rid of the 
                old tormenting doubt.&quot; Pierre held the hand of his betrothed 
                in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Helene!&quot; he said aloud and paused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Something special is always said in such cases,&quot; 
                he thought, but could not remember what it was that people say. 
                He looked at her face. She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, take those off... those...&quot; she said, pointing 
                to his spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look 
                eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed, had also 
                a frightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her 
                hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of 
                her head, she intercepted his lips and met them with her own. 
                Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is too late now, it's done; besides I love her,&quot; 
                thought Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Je vous aime!&quot;* he said, remembering what has to 
                be said at such moments: but his words sounded so weak that he 
                felt ashamed of himself. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;I love you.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezukhov's 
                large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, 
                as people said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions 
                of money.</p>

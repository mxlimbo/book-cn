              <p> 　　Boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, 
                so with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered 
                between the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though 
                Princess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive 
                than Julie, he, without knowing why, felt awkward about paying 
                court to her. When they had last met on the old prince's name 
                day, she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally, 
                evidently not listening to what he was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though 
                in a manner peculiar to herself.</p>
              <p> 　　She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she 
                had become very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought 
                herself not merely as good-looking as before but even far more 
                attractive. She was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that 
                she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that 
                the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men, and the 
                more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves 
                of her suppers, soirees, and the animated company that assembled 
                at her house, without incurring any obligation. A man who would 
                have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house 
                when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of compromising 
                her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day and 
                treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.</p>
              <p> 　　That winter the Karagins' house was the most agreeable and 
                hospitable in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner 
                parties, a large company, chiefly of men, gathered there every 
                day, supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning. 
                Julie never missed a ball, a promenade, or a play. Her dresses 
                were always of the latest fashion. But in spite of that she seemed 
                to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she 
                did not believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the 
                joys of life, and expected peace only &quot;yonder.&quot; She 
                adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, 
                like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly 
                deceived by him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her 
                she was regarded in that light, and had even herself come to believe 
                that she had suffered much in life. This melancholy, which did 
                not prevent her amusing herself, did not hinder the young people 
                who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly. Every 
                visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy 
                mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with society gossip, 
                dancing, intellectual games, and bouts rimes, which were in vogue 
                at the Karagins'. Only a few of these young men, among them Boris, 
                entered more deeply into Julie's melancholy, and with these she 
                had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly 
                things, and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful 
                sketches, maxims, and verses.</p>
              <p> 　　To Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his 
                early disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation 
                of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render, 
                and showed him her album. Boris sketched two trees in the album 
                and wrote: &quot;Rustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom and 
                melancholy upon me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote: </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Ah! contre les douleurs il n'y a pas d'autre asile.* </p>
              <p> 　　*Death gives relief and death is peaceful.</p>
              <p> 　　 Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge. Julia said this 
                was charming</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,&quot; 
                she said to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied 
                from a book. &quot;It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade 
                between sadness and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In reply Boris wrote these lines: </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Et mele une douceur secrete</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　A ces pleurs que je sens couler.* </p>
              <p> 　　*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,</p>
              <p> 　　 Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,</p>
              <p> 　　 Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,</p>
              <p> 　　 Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,</p>
              <p> 　　 And mingle a secret sweetness</p>
              <p> 　　 With these tears that I feel to be flowing. </p>
              <p> 　　For Boris, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. 
                Boris read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted 
                the reading because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at 
                large gatherings Julie and Boris looked on one another as the 
                only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent 
                people.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna, who often visited the Karagins, while playing 
                cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie's dowry 
                (she was to have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests). 
                Anna Mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her 
                son to the wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the 
                Divine will.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,&quot; 
                she said to the daughter. &quot;Boris says his soul finds repose 
                at your house. He has suffered so many disappointments and is 
                so sensitive,&quot; said she to the mother. &quot;Ah, my dear, 
                I can't tell you how fond I have grown of Julie latterly,&quot; 
                she said to her son. &quot;But who could help loving her? She 
                is an angelic being! Ah, Boris, Boris!&quot;- she paused. &quot;And 
                how I pity her mother,&quot; she went on; &quot;today she showed 
                me her accounts and letters from Penza (they have enormous estates 
                there), and she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they 
                do cheat her so!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. 
                He laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what 
                she had to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the 
                Penza and Nizhegorod estates.</p>
              <p> 　　Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy 
                adorer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of 
                repulsion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for 
                her artificiality, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility 
                of real love still restrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He 
                spent every day and whole days at the Karagins', and every day 
                on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose 
                tomorrow. But in Julie's presence, looking at her red face and 
                chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression 
                of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural 
                rapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the decisive words, 
                though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor 
                of those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the 
                use of the income from them. Julie saw Boris' indecision, and 
                sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to 
                him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied her 
                with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from 
                love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, 
                and not long before Boris' departure she formed a definite plan 
                of action. Just as Boris' leave of absence was expiring, Anatole 
                Kuragin made his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the Karagins' 
                drawing room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became 
                cheerful and very attentive to Kuragin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, &quot;I 
                know from a reliable source that Prince Vasili has sent his son 
                to Moscow to get him married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that 
                I should be sorry for her. What do you think of it, my dear?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away 
                that whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of 
                seeing all the revenue from the Penza estates which he had already 
                mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands 
                of another, and especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, 
                pained Boris. He drove to the Karagins' with the firm intention 
                of proposing. Julie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually 
                of how she had enjoyed yesterday's ball, and asked when he was 
                leaving. Though Boris had come intentionally to speak of his love 
                and therefore meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably 
                of feminine inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness 
                to joy, and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be 
                paying court to them. Julie was offended and replied that it was 
                true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing over and over 
                again would weary anyone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then I should advise you...&quot; Boris began, wishing 
                to sting her; but at that instant the galling thought occurred 
                to him that he might have to leave Moscow without having accomplished 
                his aim, and have vainly wasted his efforts- which was a thing 
                he never allowed to happen.</p>
              <p> 　　He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered 
                his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute 
                face, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the 
                contrary...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability 
                had suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were 
                fixed on him with greedy expectation. &quot;I can always arrange 
                so as not to see her often,&quot; thought Boris. &quot;The affair 
                has been begun and must be finished!&quot; He blushed hotly, raised 
                his eyes to hers, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know my feelings for you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was no need to say more: Julie's face shone with triumph 
                and self-satisfaction; but she forced Boris to say all that is 
                said on such occasions- that he loved her and had never loved 
                any other woman more than her. She knew that for the Penza estates 
                and Nizhegorod forests she could demand this, and she received 
                what she demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed 
                gloom and melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a 
                splendid house in Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything 
                for a brilliant wedding.</p>

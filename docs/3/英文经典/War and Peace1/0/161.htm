              <p> 　　Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov's. The plan for Natalie 
                Rostova's abduction had been arranged and the preparations made 
                by Dolokhov a few days before, and on the day that Sonya, after 
                listening at Natasha's door, resolved to safeguard her, it was 
                to have been put into execution. Natasha had promised to come 
                out to Kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening. Kuragin 
                was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive 
                her forty miles to the village of Kamenka, where an unfrocked 
                priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them. 
                At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them 
                to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would hasten abroad 
                with post horses.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand 
                rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed 
                with Dolokhov's help.</p>
              <p> 　　Two witnesses for the mock marriage- Khvostikov, a retired 
                petty official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, 
                and Makarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an 
                unbounded affection for Kuragin- were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's 
                front room.</p>
              <p> 　　In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling 
                with Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dolokhov in a traveling 
                cloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay abacus and 
                some bundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, 
                walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, 
                through the study to the room behind, where his French valet and 
                others were packing the last of his things. Dolokhov was counting 
                the money and noting something down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Khvostikov must have two 
                thousand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give it to him, then,&quot; said Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Makarka&quot; (their name for Makarin) &quot;will go 
                through fire and water for you for nothing. So here are our accounts 
                all settled,&quot; said Dolokhov, showing him the memorandum. 
                &quot;Is that right?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; returned Anatole, evidently not 
                listening to Dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile 
                that did not leave his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to Anatole with 
                an ironic smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know? You'd really better drop it all. There's 
                still time!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fool,&quot; retorted Anatole. &quot;Don't talk nonsense! 
                If you only knew... it's the devil knows what!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, really, give it up!&quot; said Dolokhov. &quot;I 
                am speaking seriously. It's no joke, this plot you've hatched.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?&quot; said 
                Anatole, making a grimace. &quot;Really it's no time for your 
                stupid jokes,&quot; and he left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole 
                had gone out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You wait a bit,&quot; he called after him. &quot;I'm 
                not joking, I'm talking sense. Come here, come here!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov, trying to give him 
                his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now listen to me. I'm telling you this for the last 
                time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged 
                everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? 
                Who raised the money? I did it all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?&quot; 
                And Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; 
                it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it- a stupid 
                business. Well, you'll carry her off- all right! Will they let 
                it stop at that? It will come out that you're already married. 
                Why, they'll have you in the criminal court....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, nonsense, nonsense!&quot; Anatole ejaculated and 
                again made a grimace. &quot;Didn't I explain to you? What?&quot; 
                And Anatole, with the partiality dull-witted people have for any 
                conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning, repeated 
                the argument he had already put to Dolokhov a hundred times. &quot;Didn't 
                I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion: if this 
                marriage is invalid,&quot; he went on, crooking one finger, &quot;then 
                I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no matter! Abroad 
                no one will know anything about it. Isn't that so? And don't talk 
                to me, don't, don't.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Seriously, you'd better drop it! You'll only get yourself 
                into a mess!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go to the devil!&quot; cried Anatole and, clutching 
                his hair, left the room, but returned at once and dropped into 
                an armchair in front of Dolokhov with his feet turned under him. 
                &quot;It's the very devil! What? Feel how it beats!&quot; He took 
                Dolokhov's hand and put it on his heart. &quot;What a foot, my 
                dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!&quot; he added in French. 
                &quot;What?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent 
                eyes looked at him- evidently wishing to get some more amusement 
                out of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well and when the money's gone, what then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What then? Eh?&quot; repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed 
                by a thought of the future. &quot;What then?... Then, I don't 
                know.... But why talk nonsense!&quot; He glanced at his watch. 
                &quot;It's time!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole went into the back room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!&quot; he shouted 
                to the servants.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered 
                to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, 
                and went into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow 
                and smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly 
                to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come and eat something. Have a drink!&quot; Dolokhov 
                shouted to him from the other room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't want to,&quot; answered Anatole continuing to 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come! Balaga is here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balaga was a famous 
                troyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years 
                and had given them good service with his troykas. More than once 
                when Anatole's regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him 
                from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and 
                driven him back again the next night. More than once he had enabled 
                Dolokhov to escape when pursued. More than once he had driven 
                them through the town with gypsies and &quot;ladykins&quot; as 
                he called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had 
                run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow 
                and had always been protected from the consequences by &quot;my 
                gentlemen&quot; as he called them. He had ruined more than one 
                horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him, and 
                more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, 
                which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of 
                them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. 
                They often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink 
                and dance at the gypsies', and more than one thousand rubles of 
                their money had passed through his hands. In their service he 
                risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in their 
                service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would 
                buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles 
                an hour, liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, 
                and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked 
                to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind him: &quot;Get on! Get 
                on!&quot; when it was impossible to go any faster. He liked giving 
                a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead than 
                alive, was already hurrying out of his way. &quot;Real gentlemen!&quot; 
                he considered them.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving 
                and because he liked the things they liked. With others Balaga 
                bargained, charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours' drive, 
                and rarely drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. 
                But with &quot;his gentlemen&quot; he always drove himself and 
                never demanded anything for his work. Only a couple of times a 
                year- when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand- 
                he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow 
                would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always made him sit 
                down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir,&quot; or &quot;your 
                excellency,&quot; he would say. &quot;I am quite out of horses. 
                Let me have what you can to go to the fair.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give 
                him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.</p>
              <p> 　　Balaga was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of 
                about twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, 
                glittering little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, 
                silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin.</p>
              <p> 　　On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward 
                the front corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding 
                out a small, black hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Theodore Ivanych!&quot; he said, bowing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good day, your excellency!&quot; he said, again holding 
                out his hand to Anatole who had just come in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, Balaga,&quot; said Anatole, putting his hands 
                on the man's shoulders, &quot;do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, 
                do me a service.... What horses have you come with? Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,&quot; 
                replied Balaga.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to death but get 
                me there in three hours. Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When they are dead, what shall I drive?&quot; said Balaga 
                with a wink.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make jokes!&quot; 
                cried Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why joke?&quot; said the driver, laughing. &quot;As 
                if I'd grudge my gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses 
                can gallop, so fast we'll go!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said Anatole. &quot;Well, sit down.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sit down!&quot; said Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll stand, Theodore Ivanych.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!&quot; said Anatole, 
                and filled a large glass of Madeira for him.</p>
              <p> 　　The driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After 
                refusing it for manners' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth 
                with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And when are we to start, your excellency?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well...&quot; Anatole looked at his watch. &quot;We'll 
                start at once. Mind, Balaga! You'll get there in time? Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't 
                we be there in time?&quot; replied Balaga. &quot;Didn't we get 
                you to Tver in seven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,&quot; 
                said Anatole, smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin 
                who gazed rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. &quot;Will you 
                believe it, Makarka, it took one's breath away, the rate we flew. 
                We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over 
                two of them. Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those were horses!&quot; Balaga continued the tale. 
                &quot;That time I'd harnessed two young side horses with the bay 
                in the shafts,&quot; he went on, turning to Dolokhov. &quot;Will 
                you believe it, Theodore Ivanych, those animals flew forty miles? 
                I couldn't hold them in, my hands grew numb in the sharp frost 
                so that I threw down the reins- 'Catch hold yourself, your excellency!' 
                says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled 
                there. It wasn't a case of urging them on, there was no holding 
                them in till we reached the place. The devils took us there in 
                three hours! Only the near one died of it.&quot;</p>

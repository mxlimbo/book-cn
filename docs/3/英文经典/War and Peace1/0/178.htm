              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the 
                room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkonski, 
                but not pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his 
                adjutant as he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen 
                had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive 
                the sovereign. Chernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the 
                porch, where the Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. 
                Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and 
                the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was listening with 
                a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing 
                to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian, 
                oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And as for the man who advised forming this camp- the 
                Drissa camp,&quot; said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps 
                and noticing Prince Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, &quot;as 
                to that person, sire...&quot; continued Paulucci, desperately, 
                apparently unable to restrain himself, &quot;the man who advised 
                the Drissa camp- I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or 
                the gallows!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Without heeding the end of the Italian's remarks, and as though 
                not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed 
                him graciously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are 
                meeting, and wait for me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince 
                Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed 
                behind them. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor's 
                permission, accompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, 
                into the drawing room where the council was assembled.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, 
                as it were, of chief of the Emperor's staff. He came out of the 
                study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on 
                a table, and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion 
                of the gentlemen present. What had happened was that news (which 
                afterwards proved to be false) had been received during the night 
                of a movement by the French to outflank the Drissa camp.</p>
              <p> 　　The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty 
                that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position 
                away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this 
                was inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could 
                have an opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should 
                unite and there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had 
                thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much 
                to answer the questions put- which, in fact, his plan did not 
                answer- as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was 
                one of the millions of proposals, one as good as another, that 
                could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the 
                war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others defended them. 
                Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general's views more 
                warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew 
                from his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission 
                to read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another 
                scheme, totally different from Armfeldt's or Pfuel's plan of campaign. 
                In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, 
                which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty 
                and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were 
                situated.</p>
              <p> 　　During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen 
                (his &quot;bridge&quot; in court relations), were silent. Pfuel 
                only snorted contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would 
                never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now 
                hearing. So when Prince Volkonski, who was in the chair, called 
                on him to give his opinion, he merely said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid 
                position with an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman's 
                attack- very fine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?&quot; 
                said he. &quot;Why, you yourselves know everything better than 
                I do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the 
                Emperor's name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly 
                growing animated, began to speak:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody 
                thought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How 
                mend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down 
                by me must be strictly adhered to,&quot; said he, drumming on 
                the table with his bony fingers. &quot;What is the difficulty? 
                Nonsense, childishness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that 
                no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, 
                that everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were 
                really going to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.</p>
              <p> 　　Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in 
                French. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke 
                French badly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep 
                pace with Pfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all 
                that had happened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen 
                in his scheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the 
                whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely 
                executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and 
                at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician 
                who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem 
                that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and continued 
                to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to 
                Pfuel and saying, &quot;Is it not so, your excellency?&quot; But 
                Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own 
                side, shouted angrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, of course, what more is there to explain?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously 
                in French. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained 
                to Volkonski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in 
                silence.</p>
              <p> 　　Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, 
                angry, determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all 
                those present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for 
                himself, nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that 
                the plan, formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should 
                be carried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, 
                but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion 
                to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had 
                one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of 
                war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon's genius, 
                which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything 
                was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from 
                every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other's 
                proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian 
                like everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling 
                of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone 
                in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had 
                allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but above all 
                from a certain desperation in Pfuel's own expressions, it was 
                clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall 
                was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German 
                sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the 
                temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he concealed the 
                fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was evidently 
                in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory 
                by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world 
                was slipping away from him.</p>
              <p> 　　The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they 
                lasted the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts 
                and personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any 
                general conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, 
                listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, 
                refutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they 
                were saying. A thought that had long since and often occurred 
                to him during his military activities- the idea that there is 
                not and cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there 
                can be no such thing as a military genius- now appeared to him 
                an obvious truth. &quot;What theory and science is possible about 
                a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown 
                and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting 
                forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee 
                in what condition our or the enemy's armies will be in a day's 
                time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment. 
                Sometimes- when there is not a coward at the front to shout, 'We 
                are cut off!' and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who 
                shouts, 'Hurrah!'- a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty 
                thousand, as at Schon Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run 
                from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there 
                be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing 
                can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, 
                the significance of which is determined at a particular moment 
                which arrives no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut 
                in half, and Paulucci says we have got the French army between 
                two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp 
                lies in having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what 
                constitutes its strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, 
                and they are all good and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestions 
                can be seen only at the moment of trial. And why do they all speak 
                of a 'military genius'? Is a man a genius who can order bread 
                to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the 
                right and who to the left? It is only because military men are 
                invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter 
                power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. 
                The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or 
                absent-minded men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted 
                that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied 
                face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander 
                not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence 
                of the highest and best human attributes- love, poetry, tenderness, 
                and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly 
                convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he 
                will not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a 
                brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, 
                or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable 
                that a theory of their 'genius' was invented for them long ago 
                because they have power! The success of a military action depends 
                not on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts, 'We are lost!' 
                or who shouts, 'Hurrah!' And only in the ranks can one serve with 
                assurance of being useful.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and 
                he roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was 
                leaving.</p>
              <p> 　　At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where 
                he would like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in 
                court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the 
                sovereign's person, but for permission to serve in the army. </p>

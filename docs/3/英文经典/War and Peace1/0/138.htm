              <p> 　　The old count went home, and Natasha and Petya promised to 
                return very soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. 
                At midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown 
                with young trees. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see 
                all his whips.</p>
              <p> 　　Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman 
                stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely 
                been loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltorn, giving 
                tongue at intervals; other hounds joined in, now pausing and now 
                again giving tongue. A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded 
                ravine that a fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining 
                together, rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away 
                from Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge 
                of the ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox 
                to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite.</p>
              <p> 　　The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, 
                and Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush 
                going hard across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now 
                they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field 
                in sharper and sharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly 
                a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and 
                everything was in confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped 
                figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away 
                from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the 
                dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's this?&quot; thought Nicholas. &quot;Where's that 
                huntsman from? He is not 'Uncle's' man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without 
                strapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high 
                saddles, stood near them and there too the dogs were lying. The 
                huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox. Then from 
                that spot came the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed on 
                in case of a fight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's Ilagin's huntsman having a row with our Ivan,&quot; 
                said Nicholas' groom.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and 
                rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the 
                hounds together. Several of the field galloped to the spot where 
                the fight was going on.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, who had ridden 
                up, stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would 
                end. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting 
                and rode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. 
                While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak 
                respectfully, but he was pale and breathless and his face was 
                angry. One of his eyes was black, but he probably was not even 
                aware of it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And 
                it was my gray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He 
                snatches at the fox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on 
                my saddle! Do you want a taste of this?...&quot; said the huntsman, 
                pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking 
                to his foe.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister 
                and Petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's, 
                Ilagin's, hunting party was.</p>
              <p> 　　The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there, 
                surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.</p>
              <p> 　　The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel 
                and were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to 
                the Rostovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the 
                very woods the Rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox 
                their dogs had chased.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas, though he had never seen Ilagin, with his usual 
                absence of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports 
                of his arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest 
                foe. He rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his 
                whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate 
                steps to punish his enemy.</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman 
                in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black 
                horse, accompanied by two hunt servants.</p>
              <p> 　　Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and 
                courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young 
                count's acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised 
                his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and 
                would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a 
                fox hunted by someone else's borzois. He hoped to become better 
                acquainted with the count and invited him to draw his covert.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, 
                had followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging 
                friendly greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin lifted his beaver 
                cap still higher to Natasha and said, with a pleasant smile, that 
                the young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase 
                as well as in her beauty, of which he had heard much.</p>
              <p> 　　To expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs 
                to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually 
                kept for himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas 
                agreed, and the hunt, now doubled, moved on.</p>
              <p> 　　The way to Iligin's upland was across the fields. The hunt 
                servants fell into line. The masters rode together. &quot;Uncle,&quot; 
                Rostov, and Ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one another's dogs, 
                trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily 
                for rivals to their own borzois.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred, 
                red-spotted bitch on Ilagin's leash, slender but with muscles 
                like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had 
                heard of the swiftness of Ilagin's borzois, and in that beautiful 
                bitch saw a rival to his own Milka.</p>
              <p> 　　In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about 
                the year's harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A fine little bitch, that!&quot; said he in a careless 
                tone. &quot;Is she swift?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's after,&quot; 
                answered Ilagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, 
                for which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families 
                of house serfs. &quot;So in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing 
                to boast of, Count?&quot; he went on, continuing the conversation 
                they had begun. And considering it polite to return the young 
                count's compliment, Ilagin looked at his borzois and picked out 
                Milka who attracted his attention by her breadth. &quot;That black-spotted 
                one of yours is fine- well shaped!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, she's fast enough,&quot; replied Nicholas, and 
                thought: &quot;If only a full-grown hare would cross the field 
                now I'd show you what sort of borzoi she is,&quot; and turning 
                to his groom, he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found 
                a hare.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand,&quot; continued Ilagin, &quot;how 
                some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, 
                I can tell you, Count, I enjoy riding in company such as this... 
                what could be better?&quot; (he again raised his cap to Natasha) 
                &quot;but as for counting skins and what one takes, I don't care 
                about that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course not!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not 
                mine catches something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the 
                chase, is it not so, Count? For I consider that...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A-tu!&quot; came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi 
                whippers-in, who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, 
                holding his whip aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, 
                &quot;A-tu!&quot; (This call and the uplifted whip meant that 
                he saw a sitting hare.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, he has found one, I think,&quot; said Ilagin carelessly. 
                &quot;Yes, we must ride up.... Shall we both course it?&quot; 
                answered Nicholas, seeing in Erza and &quot;Uncle's&quot; red 
                Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against 
                his own borzois. &quot;And suppose they outdo my Milka at once!&quot; 
                he thought as he rode with &quot;Uncle&quot; and Ilagin toward 
                the hare.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A full-grown one?&quot; asked Ilagin as he approached 
                the whip who had sighted the hare- and not without agitation he 
                looked round and whistled to Erza.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you, Michael Nikanorovich?&quot; he said, addressing 
                &quot;Uncle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can I join in? Why, you've given a village for each 
                of your borzois! That's it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. 
                Try yours against one another, you two, and I'll look on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rugay, hey, hey!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Rugayushka!&quot; 
                he added, involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection 
                and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt 
                the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were trying 
                to conceal, and was herself excited by it.</p>
              <p> 　　The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip 
                and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that 
                were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the 
                whips, but not the gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving 
                slowly and sedately.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is it pointing?&quot; asked Nicholas, riding a hundred 
                paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare.</p>
              <p> 　　But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost 
                coming next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack 
                on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from 
                all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the 
                hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who had been moving slowly, 
                shouted, &quot;Stop!&quot; calling in the hounds, while the borzoi 
                whips, with a cry of &quot;A-tu!&quot;galloped across the field 
                setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilagin, Nicholas, 
                Natasha, and &quot;Uncle&quot; flew, reckless of where and how 
                they went, seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only 
                to lose sight even for an instant of the chase. The hare they 
                had started was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did 
                not run at once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting 
                and trampling that resounded from all sides at once. He took a 
                dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, 
                and, finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger, 
                laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had been lying 
                in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing where 
                the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted 
                him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue 
                him, but they had not gone far before Ilagin's red-spotted Erza 
                passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible 
                swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, 
                rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded 
                off yet more swiftly. From behind Erza rushed the broad-haunched, 
                black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Milashka, dear!&quot; rose Nicholas' triumphant cry. 
                It looked as if Milka would immediately pounce on the hare, but 
                she overtook him and flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the 
                beautiful Erza reached him, but when close to the hare's scut 
                paused as if measuring the distance, so as not to make a mistake 
                this time but seize his hind leg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Erza, darling! Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. 
                Erza did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she 
                would have seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the 
                balk between the winter rye and the stubble. Again Erza and Milka 
                were abreast, running like a pair of carriage horses, and began 
                to overtake the hare, but it was easier for the hare to run on 
                the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rugay, Rugayushka! That's it, come on!&quot; came a 
                third voice just then, and &quot;Uncle's&quot; red borzoi, straining 
                and curving its back, caught up with the two foremost borzois, 
                pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain, put on 
                speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield, 
                again put on speed still more viciously, sinking to his knees 
                in the muddy field, and all one could see was how, muddying his 
                back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois surrounded 
                him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs. 
                Only the delighted &quot;Uncle&quot; dismounted, and cut off a 
                pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously 
                glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. 
                He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about. &quot;That's 
                it, come on! That's a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the 
                thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That's it, come 
                on!&quot; said he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if 
                he were abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies and had 
                insulted him, and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying 
                himself. &quot;There are your thousand-ruble ones.... That's it, 
                come on!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rugay, here's a pad for you!&quot; he said, throwing 
                down the hare's muddy pad. &quot;You've deserved it, that's it, 
                come on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down three times 
                by herself,&quot; said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone 
                and regardless of whether he were heard or not.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what is there in running across it like that?&quot; 
                said Ilagin's groom.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel 
                could take it,&quot; Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless 
                from his gallop and his excitement. At the same moment Natasha, 
                without drawing breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so 
                piercingly that it set everyone's ear tingling. By that shriek 
                she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once, 
                and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed 
                of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it 
                at any other time. &quot;Uncle&quot; himself twisted up the hare, 
                threw it neatly and smartly across his horse's back as if by that 
                gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not 
                wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The 
                others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much 
                later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference. 
                For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who, his arched 
                back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked 
                along just behind &quot;Uncle's&quot; horse with the serene air 
                of a conqueror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I am like any other dog as long as it's not a 
                question of coursing. But when it is, then look out!&quot; his 
                appearance seem to Nicholas to be saying.</p>
              <p> 　　When, much later, &quot;Uncle&quot; rode up to Nicholas and 
                began talking to him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, 
                &quot;Uncle&quot; deigned to speak to him. </p>

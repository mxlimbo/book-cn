              <p> 　　On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, news that 
                the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The 
                spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, 
                were advancing in immense force upon Kutuzov's line of communication 
                with the troops that were arriving from Russia. If Kutuzov decided 
                to remain at Krems, Napoleon's army of one hundred and fifty thousand 
                men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army 
                of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of 
                Mack at Ulm. If Kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting 
                him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to march 
                with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending 
                himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all 
                hope of a junction with Buxhowden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat 
                along the road from Krems to Olmutz, to unite with the troops 
                arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road 
                by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered 
                by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march 
                against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from 
                two sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov chose this latter course.</p>
              <p> 　　The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, 
                were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six 
                miles off on the line of Kutuzov's retreat. If he reached Znaim 
                before the French, there would be great hope of saving the army; 
                to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of 
                his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter 
                destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army was 
                impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter 
                and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.</p>
              <p> 　　The night he received the news, Kutuzov sent Bagration's vanguard, 
                four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim 
                to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without 
                resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and 
                if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them 
                as long as possible. Kutuzov himself with all his transport took 
                the road to Znaim.</p>
              <p> 　　Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, 
                with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his 
                men as stragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim 
                road at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching 
                Hollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to 
                march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration 
                with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain 
                for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn, 
                which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible 
                possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna 
                bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to 
                try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagration's weak 
                detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov's whole 
                army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival 
                of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and 
                with this object offered a three days' truce on condition that 
                both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared 
                that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that 
                he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. 
                Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, 
                believed Murat's emissary and retired, leaving Bagration's division 
                exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce 
                the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three 
                days' truce. Bagration replied that he was not authorized either 
                to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to 
                report the offer he had received.</p>
              <p> 　　A truce was Kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time, giving 
                Bagration's exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport 
                and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) 
                advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave 
                the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On 
                receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General 
                Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp. 
                Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to 
                offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants 
                back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains 
                of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagration's exhausted 
                and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the 
                transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face 
                of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov's expectations that the proposals of capitulation 
                (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the 
                transport to pass, and also that Murat's mistake would very soon 
                be discovered, proved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at 
                Schonbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabrunn) received Murat's dispatch 
                with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a 
                ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat: </p>
              <p> 　　　　Schonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,</p>
              <p> 　　　　at eight o'clock in the morning</p>
              <p> 　　To PRINCE MURAT,</p>
              <p> 　　I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You 
                command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an 
                armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits 
                of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the 
                enemy. Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation 
                had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia 
                has that right.</p>
              <p> 　　If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, 
                I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the 
                Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and 
                artillery.</p>
              <p> 　　The Russian Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers 
                are nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The 
                Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna 
                bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp 
                of the Emperor.</p>
              <p>　　 NAPOLEON </p>
              <p> 　　Bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter 
                to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved 
                with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting 
                a ready victim escape, and Bagration's four thousand men merrily 
                lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge 
                for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or 
                imagined what was in store for him. </p>

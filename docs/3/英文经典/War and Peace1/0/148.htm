              <p> 　　In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor- Metivier- 
                who had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, 
                amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily 
                clever doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as 
                a doctor, but as an equal.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly 
                on Mademoiselle Bourienne's advice had allowed this doctor to 
                visit him and had grown accustomed to him. Metivier came to see 
                the prince about twice a week.</p>
              <p> 　　On December 6- St. Nicholas' Day and the prince's name day- 
                all Moscow came to the prince's front door but he gave orders 
                to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a 
                list of whom he gave to Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Metivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, 
                considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne,* 
                as he told Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened 
                that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of 
                his worst moods. He had been going about the house all the morning 
                finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what 
                was said to him and not to be understood himself. Princess Mary 
                well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness, which generally 
                culminated in a burst of rage, and she went about all that morning 
                as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable 
                explosion. Until the doctor's arrival the morning had passed off 
                safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary sat down with 
                a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could 
                hear all that passed in the study. </p>
              <p> 　　*To force the guard. </p>
              <p> 　　At first she heard only Metivier's voice, then her father's, 
                then both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was 
                flung open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure 
                of the terrified Metivier with his shock of black hair, and the 
                prince in his dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury 
                and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You don't understand?&quot; shouted the prince, &quot;but 
                I do! French spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! 
                Be off, I tell you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Metivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood 
                to the head. Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow,&quot; said 
                Metivier; and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away.</p>
              <p> 　　Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and 
                the cry: &quot;Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment's 
                peace in my own house!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After Metivier's departure the old prince called his daughter 
                in, and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to 
                blame that a spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, 
                told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on 
                that list? Then why was that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause 
                of it all. With her, he said, he could not have a moment's peace 
                and could not die quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, 
                understand it! I cannot endure any more,&quot; he said, and left 
                the room. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation, 
                he returned and trying to appear calm added: &quot;And don't imagine 
                I have said this in a moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought 
                it over, and it will be carried out- we must part; so find some 
                place for yourself....&quot; But he could not restrain himself 
                and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable, 
                evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and screamed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If only some fool would marry her!&quot; Then he slammed 
                the door, sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his 
                study.</p>
              <p> 　　At two o'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.</p>
              <p> 　　These guests- the famous Count Rostopchin, Prince Lopukhin 
                with his nephew, General Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince's, 
                and of the younger generation Pierre and Boris Drubetskoy- awaited 
                the prince in the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, 
                had been anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, 
                and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince 
                in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors 
                in his house.</p>
              <p> 　　The prince's house did not belong to what is known as fashionable 
                society, but his little circle- though not much talked about in 
                town- was one it was more flattering to be received in than any 
                other. Boris had realized this the week before when the commander 
                in chief in his presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas' 
                Day, and Rostopchin had replied that he could not come:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics 
                of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, yes!&quot; replied the commander in chief. 
                &quot;How is he?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty 
                old-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the 
                solemn gathering of a court of justice. All were silent or talked 
                in low tones. Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess 
                Mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual. The guests 
                were reluctant to address her, feeling that she was in no mood 
                for their conversation. Count Rostopchin alone kept the conversation 
                going, now relating the latest town news, and now the latest political 
                gossip.</p>
              <p> 　　Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the 
                conversation. Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives 
                a report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing 
                that he took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone 
                of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved 
                of what was being done in the political world. Incidents were 
                related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going 
                from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion 
                the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond 
                which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon's 
                seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and the Russian 
                Note, hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European 
                courts.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured 
                vessel,&quot; said Count Rostopchin, repeating a phrase he had 
                uttered several times before. &quot;One only wonders at the long-suffering 
                or blindness of the crowned heads. Now the Pope's turn has come 
                and Bonaparte doesn't scruple to depose the head of the Catholic 
                Church- yet all keep silent! Our sovereign alone has protested 
                against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and 
                even...&quot; Count Rostopchin paused, feeling that he had reached 
                the limit beyond which censure was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Other territories have been offered in exchange for 
                the Duchy of Oldenburg,&quot; said Prince Bolkonski. &quot;He 
                shifts the Dukes about as I might move my serfs from Bald Hills 
                to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan estates.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable 
                strength of character and resignation,&quot; remarked Boris, joining 
                in respectfully.</p>
              <p> 　　He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had 
                had the honor of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski 
                glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply, 
                but changed his mind, evidently considering him too young.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair 
                and was surprised how badly the Note was worded,&quot; remarked 
                Count Rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject 
                quite familiar to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment, not understanding 
                why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,&quot; 
                he asked, &quot;so long as its substance is forcible?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops 
                it should be easy to have a good style,&quot; returned Count Rostopchin.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre now understood the count's dissatisfaction with the 
                wording of the Note.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung 
                up,&quot; remarked the old prince. &quot;There in Petersburg they 
                are always writing- not notes only but even new laws. My Andrew 
                there has written a whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays 
                they are always writing!&quot; and he laughed unnaturally.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general 
                cleared his throat to draw attention.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? 
                The figure cut by the new French ambassador.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward 
                in His Majesty's presence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division 
                and to the march past,&quot; continued the general, &quot;and 
                it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to 
                reply that: 'We in France pay no attention to such trifles!' The 
                Emperor did not condescend to reply. At the next review, they 
                say, the Emperor did not once deign to address him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, 
                it was impossible to pass any judgment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impudent fellows!&quot; said the prince. &quot;You know 
                Metivier? I turned him out of my house this morning. He was here; 
                they admitted him spite of my request that they should let no 
                one in,&quot; he went on, glancing angrily at his daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor 
                and the reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy. Though 
                these reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made 
                any rejoinder.</p>
              <p> 　　After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to 
                congratulate the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled, 
                clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told 
                her that he had not forgotten the morning's talk, that his decision 
                remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered 
                his speaking of it to her now.</p>
              <p> 　　When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, 
                the old men sat together.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views 
                on the impending war.</p>
              <p> 　　He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so 
                long as we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves 
                into European affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace 
                of Tilsit. &quot;We ought not to fight either for or against Austria. 
                Our political interests are all in the East, and in regard to 
                Bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm 
                policy, and he will never dare to cross the Russian frontier, 
                as was the case in 1807!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can we fight the French, Prince?&quot; said Count 
                Rostopchin. &quot;Can we arm ourselves against our teachers and 
                divinities? Look at our youths, look at our ladies! The French 
                are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There 
                now, you turned Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because 
                he is a Frenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after 
                him on their knees. I went to a party last night, and there out 
                of five ladies three were Roman Catholics and had the Pope's indulgence 
                for doing woolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly 
                naked, like the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. 
                Ah, when one looks at our young people, Prince, one would like 
                to take Peter the Great's old cudgel out of the museum and belabor 
                them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchin with 
                a smile and wagged his head approvingly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!&quot; said 
                Rostopchin, getting up with characteristic briskness and holding 
                out his hand to the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never 
                tire of hearing him!&quot; said the old prince, keeping hold of 
                the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed.</p>
              <p> 　　Following Rostopchin's example the others also rose. </p>

              <p> 　　During that year after his son's departure, Prince Nicholas 
                Bolkonski's health and temper became much worse. He grew still 
                more irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the 
                brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully 
                to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as 
                harshly as possible. Princess Mary had two passions and consequently 
                two joys- her nephew, little Nicholas, and religion- and these 
                were the favorite subjects of the prince's attacks and ridicule. 
                Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness 
                of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children. &quot;You 
                want to make him&quot;- little Nicholas- &quot;into an old maid 
                like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old 
                maid,&quot; he would say. Or, turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                he would ask her in Princess Mary's presence how she liked our 
                village priests and icons and would joke about them.</p>
              <p> 　　He continually hurt Princess Mary's feelings and tormented 
                her, but it cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to 
                blame toward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her 
                in spite of it all, be unjust? And what is justice? The princess 
                never thought of that proud word &quot;justice.&quot; All the 
                complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law- 
                the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who lovingly 
                suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to 
                do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure 
                and love, and that she did.</p>
              <p> 　　During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and 
                had been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary 
                had known him for a long time past. She felt that something had 
                happened to him, but he said nothing to her about his love. Before 
                he left he had a long talk with his father about something, and 
                Princess Mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied 
                with one another.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to 
                her friend Julie Karagina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed 
                (as all girls dream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at 
                that time in mourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey. </p>
              <p> 　　Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend 
                Julie.</p>
              <p> 　　Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself 
                as a special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try 
                you and your excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion 
                alone, can- I will not say comfort us- but save us from despair. 
                Religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot 
                comprehend: why, for what cause, kind and noble beings able to 
                find happiness in life- not merely harming no one but necessary 
                to the happiness of others- are called away to God, while cruel, 
                useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden to themselves 
                and to others, are left living. The first death I saw, and one 
                I shall never forget- that of my dear sister-in-law- left that 
                impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother 
                had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never 
                wronged anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind 
                thoughts, had to die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five 
                years have passed since then, and already I, with my petty understanding, 
                begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in what way that 
                death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, 
                whose every action, though generally incomprehensible to us, is 
                but a manifestation of His infinite love for His creatures. Perhaps, 
                I often think, she was too angelically innocent to have the strength 
                to perform all a mother's duties. As a young wife she was irreproachable; 
                perhaps she could not have been so as a mother. As it is, not 
                only has she left us, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the 
                purest regrets and memories, but probably she will there receive 
                a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of her alone, 
                that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence 
                on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at the 
                moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should 
                then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear 
                and certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince 
                you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of 
                life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. 
                And His will is governed only by infinite love for us, and so 
                whatever befalls us is for our good.</p>
              <p> 　　You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite 
                of my wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do 
                so. You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is 
                Buonaparte! The case is this: my father's health is growing noticeably 
                worse, he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. 
                This irritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political 
                questions. He cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating 
                on equal terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly 
                with our own, the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, 
                I am quite indifferent to politics, but from my father's remarks 
                and his talks with Michael Ivanovich I know all that goes on in 
                the world and especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, 
                who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted 
                as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father 
                cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of 
                his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going 
                to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from 
                his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the 
                benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose 
                as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. 
                In any case it will be decided very shortly.</p>
              <p> 　　Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother 
                Andrew's absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very 
                much of late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered 
                his spirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a 
                child: kind, affectionate, with that heart of gold to which I 
                know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me, that life is not 
                over for him. But together with this mental change he has grown 
                physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. 
                I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad 
                which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. 
                You write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most 
                active, cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity 
                as a relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to 
                everybody here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. 
                On his arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always 
                wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially 
                such false ones as that you write about- I mean the report of 
                my brother's betrothal to the little Rostova. I do not think my 
                brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this 
                is why: first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife 
                he has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart 
                for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little 
                angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl 
                is not the kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not 
                think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish 
                it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second 
                sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and 
                mighty care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you 
                kisses.</p>

              <p> 　　To say &quot;tomorrow&quot; and keep up a dignified tone was 
                not difficult, but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, 
                mother, and father, confess and ask for money he had no right 
                to after giving his word of honor, was terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after 
                returning from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round 
                the clavichord. As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in 
                that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rostov household 
                that winter and, now after Dolokhov's proposal and Iogel's ball, 
                seemed to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air 
                does before a thunderstorm. Sonya and Natasha, in the light-blue 
                dresses they had worn at the theater, looking pretty and conscious 
                of it, were standing by the clavichord, happy and smiling. Vera 
                was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing room. The old countess, 
                waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing patience 
                with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, with 
                sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking 
                chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes 
                rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some 
                verses called &quot;Enchantress,&quot; which he had composed, 
                and to which he was trying to fit music: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre</p>
              <p> 　　　　 What magic power is this recalls me still?</p>
              <p> 　　　　 What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill? He was 
                singing in passionate tones, gazing with gazing with his sparkling 
                black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Splendid! Excellent!&quot; exclaimed Natasha. &quot;Another 
                verse, she said, without noticing Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything's still the same with them,&quot; thought 
                Nicholas, glancing into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and 
                his mother with the old lady.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, and here's Nicholas!&quot; cried Natasha, running 
                up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is Papa at home?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am so glad you've come!&quot; said Natasha, without 
                answering him. &quot;We are enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich 
                is staying a day longer for my sake! Did you know?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Papa is not back yet,&quot; said Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!&quot; called 
                the old countess from the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently 
                at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From 
                the dancing room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices 
                trying to persuade Natasha to sing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All wight! All wight!&quot; shouted Denisov. &quot;It's 
                no good making excuses now! It's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla- 
                I entweat you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess glanced at her silent son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; said he, as if weary of being continually 
                asked the same question. &quot;Will Papa be back soon?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I expect so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything's the same with them. They know nothing about 
                it! Where am I to go?&quot; thought Nicholas, and went again into 
                the dancing room where the clavichord stood.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to 
                Denisov's favorite barcarolle. Natasha was preparing to sing. 
                Denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? 
                There's nothing to be happy about!&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My God, I'm a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through 
                my brain is the only thing left me- not singing! &quot; his thoughts 
                ran on. &quot;Go away? But where to? It's one- let them sing!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denisov 
                and the girls and avoiding their eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nikolenka, what is the matter?&quot; Sonya's eyes fixed 
                on him seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas turned away from her. Natasha too, with her quick 
                instinct, had instantly noticed her brother's condition. But, 
                though she noticed it, she was herself in such high spirits at 
                that moment, so far from sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that 
                she purposely deceived herself as young people often do. &quot;No, 
                I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone's 
                sorrow,&quot; she felt, and she said to herself: &quot;No, I must 
                be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, Sonya!&quot; she said, going to the very middle 
                of the room, where she considered the resonance was best.</p>
              <p> 　　Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, 
                as ballet dancers do, Natasha, rising energetically from her heels 
                to her toes, stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's me!&quot; she seemed to say, answering the 
                rapt gaze with which Denisov followed her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what is she so pleased about?&quot; thought Nicholas, 
                looking at his sister. &quot;Why isn't she dull and ashamed?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest 
                rose, her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious 
                of her surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which 
                anyone may produce at the same intervals hold for the same time, 
                but which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and 
                first time thrill you and make you weep.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing 
                seriously, mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing. 
                She no longer sang as a child, there was no longer in her singing 
                that comical, childish, painstaking effect that had been in it 
                before; but she did not yet sing well, as all the connoisseurs 
                who heard her said: &quot;It is not trained, but it is a beautiful 
                voice that must be trained.&quot; Only they generally said this 
                some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained 
                voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was 
                sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted 
                in it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal 
                freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet 
                untrained velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of 
                art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could 
                be altered without spoiling it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is this?&quot; thought Nicholas, listening to her 
                with widely opened eyes. &quot;What has happened to her? How she 
                is singing today!&quot; And suddenly the whole world centered 
                for him on anticipation of the next note, the next phrase, and 
                everything in the world was divided into three beats: &quot;Oh 
                mio crudele affetto.&quot;... One, two, three... one, two, three... 
                One... &quot;Oh mio crudele affetto.&quot;... One, two, three... 
                One. &quot;Oh, this senseless life of ours!&quot; thought Nicholas. 
                &quot;All this misery, and money, and Dolokhov, and anger, and 
                honor- it's all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natasha, 
                now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How will she take that si? 
                She's taken it! Thank God!&quot; And without noticing that he 
                was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third below 
                the high note. &quot;Ah, God! How fine! Did I really take it? 
                How fortunate!&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that 
                was finest in Rostov's soul! And this something was apart from 
                everything else in the world and above everything in the world. 
                &quot;What were losses, and Dolokhov, and words of honor?... All 
                nonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be happy...&quot;</p>

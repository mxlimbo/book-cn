              <p> 　　Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at 
                the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon's court.</p>
              <p> 　　The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room 
                where many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates- 
                several of whom Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor 
                of Russia- were waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive 
                the Russian general before going for his ride.</p>
              <p> 　　After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty 
                came into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked 
                Balashev to follow him.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which 
                led into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor 
                had dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. 
                He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it 
                were opened rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the 
                sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute- they were those 
                of Napoleon. He had just finished dressing for his ride, and wore 
                a blue uniform, opening in front over a white waistcoat so long 
                that it covered his rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly 
                fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His 
                short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung 
                down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck 
                stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he 
                smelled of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, 
                with its prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression 
                of imperial welcome.</p>
              <p> 　　He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head 
                slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad 
                thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, 
                had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty 
                who live in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best 
                of spirits that day.</p>
              <p> 　　He nodded in answer to Balashav's low and respectful bow, 
                and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values 
                every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what 
                he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and 
                say it well.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good day, General!&quot; said he. &quot;I have received 
                the letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very 
                glad to see you.&quot; He glanced with his large eyes into Balashav's 
                face and immediately looked past him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was plain that Balashev's personality did not interest 
                him at all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind 
                interested him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for 
                him, because everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended 
                entirely on his will.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not, and did not, desire war,&quot; he continued, 
                &quot;but it has been forced on me. Even now&quot; (he emphasized 
                the word) &quot;I am ready to receive any explanations you can 
                give me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons 
                for dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the 
                calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor 
                spoke, Balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace 
                and intended to enter into negotiations.</p>
              <p> 　　When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly 
                at the Russian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared 
                long before: &quot;Sire! The Emperor, my master...&quot; but the 
                sight of the Emperor's eyes bent on him confused him. &quot;You 
                are flurried- compose yourself!&quot; Napoleon seemed to say, 
                as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at Balashev's uniform 
                and sword.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that 
                the Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his 
                passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on 
                his own initiative and without his sovereign's assent, that the 
                Emperor Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with 
                England.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not yet!&quot; interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing 
                to give vent to his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as 
                a sign that Balashev might proceed.</p>
              <p> 　　After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added 
                that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter 
                into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated: 
                he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written 
                in his letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov 
                and had told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered 
                these words, &quot;So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian 
                soil,&quot; but some complex feeling restrained him. He could 
                not utter them, though he wished to do so. He grew confused and 
                said: &quot;On condition that the French army retires beyond the 
                Niemen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon noticed Balashev's embarrassment when uttering these 
                last words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began 
                to quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he 
                began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. 
                During the speech that followed, Balashev, who more than once 
                lowered his eyes, involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon's 
                left leg which increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,&quot; 
                he began. &quot;Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything 
                to obtain it? I have waited eighteen months for explanations. 
                But in order to begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?&quot; 
                he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with 
                his small white plump hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,&quot; 
                replied Balashev.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Niemen?&quot; repeated Napoleon. &quot;So now you 
                want me to retire beyond the Niemen- only the Niemen?&quot; repeated 
                Napoleon, looking straight at Balashev.</p>
              <p> 　　The latter bowed his head respectfully.</p>
              <p> 　　Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from 
                Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. 
                Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond 
                the Niemen before commencing negotiations, but in just the same 
                way two months ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond 
                the Vistula and the Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other 
                and again stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that 
                his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed 
                petrified in its stern expression. This quivering of his left 
                leg was a thing Napoleon was conscious of. &quot;The vibration 
                of my left calf is a great sign with me,&quot; he remarked at 
                a later date.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder 
                may be made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!&quot; Napoleon 
                almost screamed, quite to his own surprise. &quot;If you gave 
                me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept such conditions. You 
                say I have begun this war! But who first joined his army? The 
                Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I 
                have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, 
                and when your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! 
                But what is the aim of your alliance with England? What has she 
                given you?&quot; he continued hurriedly, evidently no longer trying 
                to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility, but 
                only to prove his own rectitude and power and Alexander's errors 
                and duplicity.</p>
              <p> 　　The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with 
                the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position 
                and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But 
                he had begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he 
                control his words.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt 
                himself and insult Alexander- just what he had least desired at 
                the commencement of the interview.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hear you have made peace with Turkey?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peace has been concluded...&quot; he began.</p>
              <p> 　　But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to 
                do all the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort 
                of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people 
                are so prone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without 
                obtaining Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign 
                those provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,&quot; he went on, 
                &quot;I promised and would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia 
                and Wallachia, and now he won't have those splendid provinces. 
                Yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign 
                would have extended Russia from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths 
                of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not have done more,&quot; 
                said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he paced up and 
                down the room, repeating to Balashev almost the very words he 
                had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. &quot;All that, he would 
                have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!&quot; he 
                repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold 
                snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might 
                have been!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the 
                latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What could he wish or look for that he would not have 
                obtained through my friendship?&quot; demanded Napoleon, shrugging 
                his shoulders in perplexity. &quot;But no, he has preferred to 
                surround himself with my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, 
                Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled 
                from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, 
                a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier 
                than the others, but all the same an incompetent who was unable 
                to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories 
                in the Emperor Alexander's mind.... Granted that were they competent 
                they might be made use of,&quot; continued Napoleon- hardly able 
                to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly 
                sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his perception 
                the two were one and the same)- &quot;but they are not even that! 
                They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be 
                the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by 
                his first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? 
                Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, 
                called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes 
                bringing no result. Bagration alone is a military man. He's stupid, 
                but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what 
                role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They 
                compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that 
                happens. A sovereign should not be with the army unless he is 
                a general!&quot; said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words 
                as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired 
                to be a military commander.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven't 
                even been able to defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been 
                driven out of the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, Your Majesty,&quot; said Balashev, 
                hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following 
                these verbal fireworks with difficulty, &quot;the troops are burning 
                with eagerness...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know everything!&quot; Napoleon interrupted him. &quot;I 
                know everything. I know the number of your battalions as exactly 
                as I know my own. You have not two hundred thousand men, and I 
                have three times that number. I give you my word of honor,&quot; 
                said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor could carry no 
                weight- &quot;I give you my word of honor that I have five hundred 
                and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will 
                be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it 
                by making peace with you. As for the Swedes- it is their fate 
                to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed 
                him for another- Bernadotte, who promptly went mad- for no Swede 
                would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox 
                to his nose.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon's remarks, 
                and would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man 
                wishing to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. 
                To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply 
                that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: 
                but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon 
                was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, 
                talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. 
                Balashev began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean 
                his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, 
                he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently 
                seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by 
                Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would 
                be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balashev stood 
                with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon's stout 
                legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what do I care about your allies?&quot; said Napoleon. 
                &quot;I have allies- the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them 
                and they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand 
                of them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had 
                uttered this obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood 
                silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, 
                Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashev's face, 
                and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, 
                almost shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I'll wipe 
                it off the map of Europe!&quot; he declared, his face pale and 
                distorted by anger, and he struck one of his small hands energetically 
                with the other. &quot;Yes, I will throw you back beyond the Dvina 
                and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect against you that barrier 
                which it was criminal and blind of Europe to allow to be destroyed. 
                Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what you have gained 
                by alienating me!&quot; And he walked silently several times up 
                and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.</p>
              <p> 　　He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out 
                again, lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front 
                of Balashev. He paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's 
                eyes, and said in a quiet voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And yet what a splendid reign your master might have 
                had!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that 
                from the Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. 
                Napoleon was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently 
                not listening to him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results 
                were expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as 
                if to say, &quot;I know it's your duty to say that, but you don't 
                believe it yourself. I have convinced you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, 
                sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. 
                The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, 
                handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought hima pocket 
                handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to 
                Balashev:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,&quot; said he, 
                taking his hat, &quot;that I am as devoted to him as before: I 
                know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities. 
                I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter 
                to the Emperor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception 
                room rushed forward and descended the staircase.</p>

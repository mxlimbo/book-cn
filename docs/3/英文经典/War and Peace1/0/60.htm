              <p> 　　The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, 
                his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters 
                and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor 
                was unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those 
                around him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong 
                impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed 
                and wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come 
                with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, 
                was brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. 
                The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. 
                At midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he 
                rode off with Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French 
                army.</p>
              <p> 　　It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander 
                a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, 
                a personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, 
                Prince Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary 
                to negotiate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these 
                negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the 
                Tsar, and remained alone with him for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced 
                two days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief interchange 
                of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on 
                the nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which 
                lasted till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle 
                of Austerlitz was fought.</p>
              <p> 　　Till midday on the nineteenth, the activity- the eager talk, 
                running to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants- was confined 
                to the Emperor's headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, 
                this activity reached Kutiizov's headquarters and the staffs of 
                the commanders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread 
                it to all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the 
                nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied 
                troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the 
                army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.</p>
              <p> 　　The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor's 
                headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement 
                that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of 
                a large tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in 
                motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, 
                levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, 
                and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all 
                that activity.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of 
                the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final 
                result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when 
                motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which 
                the impulse has not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as 
                the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with 
                the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as 
                quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for 
                a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches it 
                and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in 
                the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of 
                innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement 
                of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated 
                human activities of 160,000 Russians and French- all their passions, 
                desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, 
                fear, and enthusiasm- was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, 
                the so-called battle of the three Emperors- that is to say, a 
                slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance 
                on the commander in chief.</p>
              <p> 　　At six in the evening, Kutuzov went to the Emperor's headquarters 
                and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the 
                grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details 
                of the coming action from Dolgorukov. He felt that Kutuzov was 
                upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters 
                they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor's 
                headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know 
                something others do not know: he therefore wished to speak to 
                Dolgorukov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?&quot; said Dolgorukov, 
                who was sitting at tea with Bilibin. &quot;The fete is for tomorrow. 
                How is your old fellow? Out of sorts?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would 
                like to be heard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But they heard him at the council of war and will hear 
                him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something 
                now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is 
                impossible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you have seen him?&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Well, 
                what is Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing 
                so much as a general engagement,&quot; repeated Dolgorukov, evidently 
                prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his 
                interview with Napoleon. &quot;If he weren't afraid of a battle 
                why did he ask for that interview? Why negotiate, and above all 
                why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting 
                war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a general battle. His 
                hour has come! Mark my words!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But tell me, what is he like, eh?&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I 
                should call him 'Your Majesty,' but who, to his chagrin, got no 
                title from me! That's the sort of man he is, and nothing more,&quot; 
                replied Dolgorukov, looking round at Bilibin with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov,&quot; he continued, 
                &quot;we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about 
                and so give him a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we 
                certainly have him in our hands! No, we mustn't forget Suvorov 
                and his rule- not to put yourself in a position to be attacked, 
                but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the energy of young 
                men often shows the way better than all the experience of old 
                Cunctators.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But in what position are we going to attack him? I have 
                been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his 
                chief forces are situated,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had 
                himself formed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, that is all the same,&quot; Dolgorukov said quickly, 
                and getting up he spread a map on the table. &quot;All eventualities 
                have been foreseen. If he is standing before Brunn...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother's 
                plan of a flanking movement.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which 
                might have been as good as Weyrother's, but for the disadvantage 
                that Weyrother's had already been approved. As soon as Prince 
                Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the 
                merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgorukov ceased to listen to 
                him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew's 
                face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There will be a council of war at Kutuzov's tonight, 
                though; you can say all this there,&quot; remarked Dolgorukov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will do so,&quot; said Prince Andrew, moving away 
                from the map.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?&quot; said 
                Bilibin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to 
                their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke. &quot;Whether 
                tomorrow brings victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms 
                is secure. Except your Kutuzov, there is not a single Russian 
                in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, 
                le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de 
                Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish 
                names.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be quiet, backbiter!&quot; said Dolgorukov. &quot;It 
                is not true; there are now two Russians, Miloradovich, and Dokhturov, 
                and there would be a third, Count Arakcheev, if his nerves were 
                not too weak.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;However, I think General Kutuzov has come out,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew. &quot;I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!&quot; 
                he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and 
                Bilibin.</p>
              <p> 　　On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking 
                Kutuzov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought 
                of tomorrow's battle.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, 
                replied: &quot;I think the battle will be lost, and so I told 
                Count Tolstoy and asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think 
                he replied? 'But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and 
                cutlets, look after military matters yourself!' Yes... That was 
                the answer I got!&quot;</p>

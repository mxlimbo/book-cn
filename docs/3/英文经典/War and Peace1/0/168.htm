              <p> 　　From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating 
                of the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces- 
                millions of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the 
                army- moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward 
                which since 1811 Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the 
                twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the 
                Russian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed 
                to human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated 
                against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries, 
                thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms, 
                and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals 
                of all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed 
                them did not at the time regard as being crimes.</p>
              <p> 　　What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its 
                causes? The historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes 
                were the wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance 
                of the Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness 
                of Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich, 
                Rumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, 
                to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or 
                for Napoleon to have written to Alexander: &quot;My respected 
                Brother, I consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg&quot;- 
                and there would have been no war.</p>
              <p> 　　We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. 
                It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England's 
                intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It 
                naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that the 
                cause of the war was Napoleon's ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, 
                that the cause of the war was the violence done to him; to businessmen 
                that the cause of the way was the Continental System which was 
                ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the chief 
                reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment; 
                to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-establishing 
                les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time that 
                it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia 
                and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from 
                Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. 
                It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity 
                of other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity 
                of points of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; 
                but to us, to posterity who view the thing that happened in all 
                its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these 
                causes seem insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions 
                of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because 
                Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England's 
                policy was astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot 
                grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual 
                fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, 
                thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined 
                the people of Smolensk and Moscow and were killed by them.</p>
              <p> 　　To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not 
                carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard 
                the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number 
                of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of 
                these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause 
                or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself 
                and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude 
                of the events, and by its impotence- apart from the cooperation 
                of all the other coincident causes- to occasion the event. To 
                us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve 
                a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon's refusal to 
                withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy 
                of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, 
                a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there 
                would have been so many less men in Napoleon's army and the war 
                could not have occurred.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should 
                withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, 
                there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected 
                to serving a second term then also there could have been no war. 
                Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues 
                and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, 
                and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or 
                a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, 
                or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so 
                on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. 
                So all these causes- myriads of causes- coincided to bring it 
                about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but 
                it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing 
                their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to 
                slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of 
                men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.</p>
              <p> 　　The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the 
                event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions 
                of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. 
                This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon 
                and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried 
                out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without 
                any one of which the event could not have taken place. It was 
                necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power- 
                the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns- should 
                consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should 
                have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and 
                complex causes.</p>
              <p> 　　We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of 
                irrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of 
                which we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events 
                in history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible 
                do they become to us.</p>
              <p> 　　Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his 
                personal aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now 
                do or abstain from doing this or that action; but as soon as he 
                has done it, that action performed at a certain moment in time 
                becomes irrevocable and belongs to history, in which it has not 
                a free but a predestined significance.</p>
              <p> 　　There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual 
                life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, 
                and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws 
                laid down for him.</p>
              <p> 　　Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument 
                in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. 
                A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time 
                with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic 
                significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the 
                more people he is connected with and the more power he has over 
                others, the more evident is the predestination and inevitability 
                of his every action.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A king is history's slave.</p>
              <p> 　　History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, 
                uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.</p>
              <p> 　　Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced 
                than ever that it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le 
                sang de ses peuples*- as Alexander expressed it in the last letter 
                he wrote him- he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable 
                laws, which compelled him, while thinking that he was acting on 
                his own volition, to perform for the hive life- that is to say, 
                for history- whatever had to be performed. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow 
                men, and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes 
                fitted in and co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches 
                for the nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg's 
                wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia- undertaken (as it 
                seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed 
                peace, the French Emperor's love and habit of war coinciding with 
                his people's inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, 
                and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining 
                advantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating 
                honors he received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, 
                in the opinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere 
                desire to attain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of 
                both sides, and millions and millions of other causes that adapted 
                themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it.</p>
              <p> 　　When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because 
                of its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because 
                it is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the 
                wind shakes it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat 
                it?</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of 
                conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. 
                And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular 
                tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who 
                stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted 
                to eat it and prayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who 
                says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished 
                because Alexander desired his destruction, and he who says that 
                an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last 
                navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic 
                events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, 
                and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the 
                event itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their 
                own will, is in an historical sense involuntary and is related 
                to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity.</p>

              <p> 　　While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the 
                committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly 
                those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg 
                he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a 
                battle, when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted 
                to the ruling circles where the future, on which the fate of millions 
                depended, was being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, 
                the curiosity of the uninitiated. the reserve of the initiated, 
                the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the innumerable committees 
                and commissions of whose existence he learned every day, he felt 
                that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was 
                in preparation, the commander in chief of which was a mysterious 
                person he did not know, but who was supposed to be a man of genius- 
                Speranski. And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince 
                Andrew had a vague idea, and Speranski its chief promoter, began 
                to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations 
                quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception 
                in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. 
                The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, the first 
                place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read, 
                and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the 
                reputation of being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, 
                who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy 
                in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the 
                son of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, 
                because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a 
                newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death 
                and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion 
                of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved 
                during these last five years, having softened and grown more manly, 
                lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and 
                acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about 
                him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.</p>
              <p> 　　The day after his interview with Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrew 
                spent the evening at Count Kochubey's. He told the count of his 
                interview with Sila Andreevich (Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by 
                that nickname with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed 
                in the Minister of War's anteroom).</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mon cher, even in this case you can't do without Michael 
                Mikhaylovich Speranski. He manages everything. I'll speak to him. 
                He has promised to come this evening.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What has Speranski to do with the army regulations?&quot; 
                asked Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Kochubey shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkonski's 
                simplicity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We were talking to him about you a few days ago,&quot; 
                Kochubey continued, &quot;and about your freed plowmen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?&quot; 
                said an old man of Catherine's day, turning contemptuously toward 
                Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was a small estate that brought in no profit,&quot; 
                replied Prince Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not 
                to irritate the old man uselessly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Afraid of being late...&quot; said the old man, looking 
                at Kochubey.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's one thing I don't understand,&quot; he continued. 
                &quot;Who will plow the land if they are set free? It is easy 
                to write laws, but difficult to rule.... Just the same as now- 
                I ask you, Count- who will be heads of the departments when everybody 
                has to pass examinations?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those who pass the examinations, I suppose,&quot; replied 
                Kochubey, crossing his legs and glancing round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I have Pryanichnikov serving under me, a splendid 
                man, a priceless man, but he's sixty. Is he to go up for examination?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's a difficulty, as education is not at all 
                general, but...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Count Kochubey did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew 
                by the arm, and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty 
                with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar 
                whiteness, who was just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail 
                coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left 
                breast. It was Speranski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, 
                and felt a throb within him, as happens at critical moments of 
                life. Whether it was from respect, envy, or anticipation, he did 
                not know. Speranski's whole figure was of a peculiar type that 
                made him easily recognizable. In the society in which Prince Andrew 
                lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy 
                gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he had never 
                seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, 
                rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; 
                nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all 
                he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands- hands 
                which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness 
                and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers 
                who had been long in hospital. This was Speranski, Secretary of 
                State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where 
                he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another 
                as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was 
                in no hurry to speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he 
                would be listened to, and he looked only at the person with whom 
                he was conversing.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew followed Speranski's every word and movement 
                with particular attention. As happens to some people, especially 
                to men who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting 
                anyone new- especially anyone whom, like Speranski, he knew by 
                reputation- expected to discover in him the perfection of human 
                qualities.</p>
              <p> 　　Speranski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to 
                come sooner as he had been detained at the palace. He did not 
                say that the Emperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this 
                affectation of modesty. When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew, 
                Speranski slowly turned his eyes to Bolkonski with his customary 
                smile and looked at him in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard 
                of you, as everyone has,&quot; he said after a pause.</p>
              <p> 　　Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had 
                given Bolkonski. Speranski smiled more markedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is 
                my good friend Monsieur Magnitski,&quot; he said, fully articulating 
                every word and syllable, &quot;and if you like I can put you in 
                touch with him.&quot; He paused at the full stop. &quot;I hope 
                you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in promoting 
                all that is reasonable.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A circle soon formed round Speranski, and the old man who 
                had talked about his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched 
                every movement of Speranski's: this man, not long since an insignificant 
                divinity student, who now, Bolkonski thought, held in his hands- 
                those plump white hands- the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was 
                struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which 
                Speranski answered the old man. He appeared to address condescending 
                words to him from an immeasurable height. When the old man began 
                to speak too loud, Speranski smiled and said he could not judge 
                of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.</p>
              <p> 　　Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Speranski 
                rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other 
                end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to 
                interest himself in Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the 
                animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved 
                me,&quot; he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating 
                by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance 
                of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered 
                Prince Andrew. &quot;I have known of you for a long time: first 
                from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of 
                which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; 
                and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber 
                who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree 
                concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so 
                much gossip and tittle-tattle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; said Prince Andrew, &quot;my father did not 
                wish me to take advantage of the privilege. I began the service 
                from the lower grade.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands 
                above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely 
                reestablishes natural justice.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think, however, that these condemnations have some 
                ground,&quot; returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speranski's 
                influence, of which he began to be conscious. He did not like 
                to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict. 
                Though he usually spoke easily and well, he felt a difficulty 
                in expressing himself now while talking with Speranski. He was 
                too much absorbed in observing the famous man's personality.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grounds of personal ambition maybe,&quot; Speranski 
                put in quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And of state interest to some extent,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Speranski quietly, lowering 
                his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am an admirer of Montesquieu,&quot; replied Prince 
                Andrew, &quot;and his idea that le principe des monarchies est 
                l'honneur me parait incontestable. Certains droits et privileges 
                de la noblesse me paraissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.&quot;* 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable. 
                Certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me 
                a means of maintaining that sentiment.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　The smile vanished from Speranski's white face, which was 
                much improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew's thought 
                interested him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,&quot;* 
                he began, pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking 
                even slower than in Russian but quite calmly. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;If you regard the question from that point of view.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Speranski went on to say that honor, l'honeur, cannot be upheld 
                by privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l'honneur, is 
                either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or 
                it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, 
                which recognize it. His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, 
                is one similar to the Legion d'honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, 
                not harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not 
                a class or court privilege.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that 
                court privileges have attained the same end,&quot; returned Prince 
                Andrew. &quot;Every courtier considers himself bound to maintain 
                his position worthily.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, 
                Prince,&quot; said Speranski, indicating by a smile that he wished 
                to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. 
                &quot;If you will do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,&quot; 
                he added, &quot;I will, after talking with Magnitski, let you 
                know what may interest you, and shall also have the pleasure of 
                a more detailed chat with you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Closing his eyes, he bowed a la francaise, without taking 
                leave, and trying to attract as little attention as possible, 
                he left the room.</p>

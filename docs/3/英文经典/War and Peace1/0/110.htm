              <p> 　　Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was 
                the time when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his 
                fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest 
                energy. That same August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche, 
                injured his leg, and remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving 
                Speranski every day and no one else. At that time the two famous 
                decrees were being prepared that so agitated society- abolishing 
                court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades 
                of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor- and not merely these 
                but a whole state constitution, intended to change the existing 
                order of government in Russia: legal, administrative, and financial, 
                from the Council of State down to the district tribunals. Now 
                those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had 
                ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put into effect 
                with the aid of his associates, Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Kochubey, 
                and Strogonov- whom he himself in jest had called his Comite de 
                salut public- were taking shape and being realized.</p>
              <p> 　　Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil 
                side, and Arakcheev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince 
                Andrew, as a gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court 
                and at a levee. The Emperor, though he met him twice, did not 
                favor him with a single word. It had always seemed to Prince Andrew 
                before that he was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter 
                disliked his face and personality generally, and in the cold, 
                repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now found further confirmation 
                of this surmise. The courtiers explained the Emperor's neglect 
                of him by His Majesty's displeasure at Bolkonski's not having 
                served since 1805.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know myself that one cannot help one's sympathies 
                and antipathies,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, &quot;so it will 
                not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations 
                to the Emperor personally, but the project will speak for itself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, 
                a friend of his father's. The field marshal made an appointment 
                to see him, received him graciously, and promised to inform the 
                Emperor. A few days later Prince Andrew received notice that he 
                was to go to see the Minister of War, Count Arakcheev. </p>
              <p> 　　On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev's 
                waiting room at nine in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know Arakcheev personally, had never seen him, 
                and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect 
                for the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, 
                and I need not concern myself about his personal qualities: he 
                has been commissioned to consider my project, so he alone can 
                get it adopted,&quot; thought Prince Andrew as he waited among 
                a number of important and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev's 
                waiting room.</p>
              <p> 　　During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew 
                had seen the anterooms of many important men, and the different 
                types of such rooms were well known to him. Count Arakcheev's 
                anteroom had quite a special character. The faces of the unimportant 
                people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment 
                and servility; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common 
                feeling of awkwardness, covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule 
                of themselves, their situation, and the person for whom they were 
                waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others whispered 
                and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname &quot;Sila Andreevich&quot; 
                and the words, &quot;Uncle will give it to us hot,&quot; in reference 
                to Count Arakcheev. One general (an important personage), evidently 
                feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing 
                his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared 
                on all faces- that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time 
                asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an 
                ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course. 
                After some others had been shown in and out of the minister's 
                room by the adjutant on duty, an officer who struck Prince Andrew 
                by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible 
                door. This officer's audience lasted a long time. Then suddenly 
                the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side 
                of the door, and the officer- with pale face and trembling lips- 
                came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching his head.</p>
              <p> 　　After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the 
                officer on duty said in a whisper, &quot;To the right, at the 
                window.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table 
                a man of forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, 
                deep wrinkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and 
                an overhanging red nose. Arakcheev turned his head toward him 
                without looking at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your petition?&quot; asked Arakcheev.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not petitioning, your excellency,&quot; returned 
                Prince Andrew quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　Arakcheev's eyes turned toward him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sit down,&quot; said he. &quot;Prince Bolkonski?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the 
                Emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted 
                by me...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, my dear sir, I have read your project,&quot; 
                interrupted Arakcheev, uttering only the first words amiably and 
                then- again without looking at Prince Andrew- relapsing gradually 
                into a tone of grumbling contempt. &quot;You are proposing new 
                military laws? There are many laws but no one to carry out the 
                old ones. Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier writing 
                than doing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I came at His Majesty the Emperor's wish to learn from 
                your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I 
                have presented,&quot; said Prince Andrew politely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and 
                sent it to the committee. I do not approve of it,&quot; said Arakcheev, 
                rising and taking a paper from his writing table. &quot;Here!&quot; 
                and he handed it to Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters, 
                misspelled, and without punctuation: &quot;Unsoundly constructed 
                because resembles an imitation of the French military code and 
                from the Articles of War needlessly deviating.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To what committee has the memorandum been referred?&quot; 
                inquired Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended 
                that your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't want one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A member without salary,&quot; repeated Arakcheev. &quot;I 
                have the honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?&quot; 
                he shouted, bowing to Prince Andrew. </p>

              <p> 　　On our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock 
                the battle had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's 
                demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility 
                from himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send 
                to inquire of the commander in chief. Bagration knew that as the 
                distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, even 
                if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), 
                and found the commander in chief (which would be very difficult), 
                he would not be able to get back before evening.</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round 
                his suite, and the boyish face Rostov, breathless with excitement 
                and hope, was the first to catch his eye. He sent him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander 
                in chief, your excellency?&quot; said Rostov, with his hand to 
                his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can give the message to His Majesty,&quot; said 
                Dolgorukov, hurriedly interrupting Bagration.</p>
              <p> 　　On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get 
                a few hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and 
                resolute, with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, 
                and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem 
                possible, pleasant, and easy.</p>
              <p> 　　All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was 
                to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than 
                that, he was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he 
                was going with a message to Kutuzov, perhaps even to the sovereign 
                himself. The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, 
                and his heart was full of joy and happiness. On receiving the 
                order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line. 
                At first he rode along the line of Bagration's troops, which had 
                not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then 
                he came to the region occupied by Uvarov's cavalry and here he 
                noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed 
                Uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry 
                ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.</p>
              <p> 　　In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three 
                musket shots at irregular intervals as before, followed by one 
                or two cannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the 
                slopes of the hill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent 
                reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated 
                from one another but merged into a general roar.</p>
              <p> 　　He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase 
                one another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, 
                spreading, and mingling with one another. He could also, by the 
                gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses 
                of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see 
                what was going on, but strain his attention as he would he could 
                not understand or make out anything of what was happening: there 
                in the smoke men of some sort were moving about, in front and 
                behind moved lines of troops; but why, whither, and who they were, 
                it was impossible to make out. These sights and sounds had no 
                depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the contrary, they 
                stimulated his energy and determination.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go on! Go on! Give it them!&quot; he mentally exclaimed 
                at these sounds, and again proceeded to gallop along the line, 
                penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army 
                was already in action.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How it will be there I don't know, but all will be well!&quot; 
                thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next 
                part of the line (the Guards) was already in action.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So much the better! I shall see it close,&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men 
                came galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered 
                ranks were returning from the attack. Rostov got out of their 
                way, involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and 
                galloped on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is no business of mine,&quot; he thought. He had 
                not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his 
                left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of 
                cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, 
                trotting straight toward him and across his path. Rostov put his 
                horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he 
                would have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but 
                they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were 
                already galloping. Rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the 
                jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and 
                even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse 
                Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming 
                to meet them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their 
                horses. Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command: 
                &quot;Charge!&quot; shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred 
                to full speed. Rostov, fearing to be crushed or swept into the 
                attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his 
                horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.</p>
              <p> 　　The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned 
                angrily on seeing Rostov before him, with whom he would inevitably 
                collide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostov and 
                his Bedouin over (Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared 
                to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostov 
                to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman's horse. 
                The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back 
                its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in 
                violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its 
                neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed 
                Rostov before he heard them shout, &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and looking 
                back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign 
                cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing 
                more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere 
                and smoke enveloped everything.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared 
                in the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or 
                to go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the 
                Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves. Rostov was horrified 
                to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, 
                of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who 
                had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen 
                were left after the charge.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe 
                I shall see the Emperor immediately! &quot; thought Rostov and 
                galloped on.</p>
              <p> 　　When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about 
                them and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was 
                aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw 
                uneasiness on the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity 
                on those of the officers.</p>
              <p> 　　Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards 
                he heard a voice calling him by name.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rostov!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot; he answered, not recognizing Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, we've been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!&quot; 
                said Boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men 
                who have been under fire for the first time.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you?&quot; he said. &quot;Well, how did it go?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We drove them back!&quot; said Boris with animation, 
                growing talkative. &quot;Can you imagine it?&quot; and he began 
                describing how the Guards, having taken up their position and 
                seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all 
                at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops 
                that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly 
                to go into action. Rostov without hearing Boris to the end spurred 
                his horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you off to?&quot; asked Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With a message to His Majesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There he is!&quot; said Boris, thinking Rostov had said 
                &quot;His Highness,&quot; and pointing to the Grand Duke who with 
                his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away 
                from them in his helmet and Horse Guards' jacket, shouting something 
                to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the commander 
                in chief or the Emperor,&quot; said Rostov, and was about to spur 
                his horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count! Count!&quot; shouted Berg who ran up from the 
                other side as eager as Boris. &quot;Count! I am wounded in my 
                right hand&quot; (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief 
                tied round it) &quot;and I remained at the front. I held my sword 
                in my left hand, Count. All our family- the von Bergs- have been 
                knights!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He said something more, but Rostov did not wait to hear it 
                and rode away.</p>
              <p> 　　Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostov, 
                to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done 
                when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, 
                going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade 
                were heard. Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front 
                of him and behind our troops, where he could never have expected 
                the enemy to be.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can it be?&quot; he thought. &quot;The enemy in 
                the rear of our army? Impossible!&quot; And suddenly he was seized 
                by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole 
                battle. &quot;But be that what it may,&quot; he reflected, &quot;there 
                is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander in chief 
                here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostov 
                was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region 
                behind the village of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all 
                kinds.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing 
                at? Who is firing?&quot; Rostov kept asking as he came up to Russian 
                and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all 
                up now!&quot; he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the 
                crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little 
                as he did.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kill the Germans!&quot; shouted one.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May the devil take them- the traitors!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Zum Henker diese Russen!&quot;* muttered a German. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Hang these Russians!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, 
                screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing 
                died down. Rostov learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers 
                had been firing at one another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My God! What does it all mean?&quot; thought he. &quot;And 
                here, where at any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, 
                these must be only a handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, 
                it can't be that, it can't be! Only to get past them quicker, 
                quicker!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov's head. 
                Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights 
                just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, 
                he could not, did not wish to, believe that. </p>

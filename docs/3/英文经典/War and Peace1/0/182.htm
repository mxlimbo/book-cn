              <p> 　　Rostov, with his keen sportsman's eye, was one of the first 
                to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. 
                Nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the 
                French dragoons pursuing them. He could already see how these 
                men, who looked so small at the foot of the hill, jostled and 
                overtook one another, waving their arms and their sabers in the 
                air.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. 
                He felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French 
                dragoons now, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge 
                was to be made it must be done now, at that very moment, or it 
                would be too late. He looked around. A captain, standing beside 
                him, was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew Sevastyanych!&quot; said Rostov. &quot;You know, 
                we could crush them....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A fine thing too!&quot; replied the captain, &quot;and 
                really...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, 
                galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he had time 
                to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing 
                his feeling, was following him. Rostov himself did not know how 
                or why he did it. He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting 
                or considering. He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping 
                in disorder; he knew they could not withstand an attack- knew 
                there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would 
                not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly 
                around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not 
                restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command, 
                and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of 
                his deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons. 
                Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace 
                instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster 
                as they drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who 
                galloped after them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing 
                the hussars, the foremost began to turn, while those behind began 
                to halt. With the same feeling with which he had galloped across 
                the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his Donets horse and galloped 
                to intersect the path of the dragoons' disordered lines. One Uhlan 
                stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to 
                avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among 
                the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back. 
                Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after him. On 
                the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and 
                almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that 
                he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That 
                Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching 
                on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another 
                moment Rostov's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters 
                of the officer's horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same 
                instant Rostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck 
                the Frenchman with it.</p>
              <p> 　　The instant he had done this, all Rostov's animation vanished. 
                The officer fell, not so much from the blow- which had but slightly 
                cut his arm above the elbow- as from the shock to his horse and 
                from fright. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his 
                foe to see whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer 
                was hopping with one foot on the ground, the other being caught 
                in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every 
                moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostov with shrinking 
                terror. His pale and mud-stained face- fair and young, with a 
                dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes- was not an enemy's face 
                at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike 
                face. Before Rostov had decided what to do with him, the officer 
                cried, &quot;I surrender!&quot; He hurriedly but vainly tried 
                to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened 
                blue eyes from Rostov's face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged 
                his foot and helped him into the saddle. On all sides, the hussars 
                were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but though his face 
                was bleeding, he would not give up his horse; another was perched 
                up behind an hussar with his arms round him; a third was being 
                helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the French infantry 
                were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with 
                their prisoners. Rostov galloped back with the rest, aware of 
                an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague 
                and confused, which he could not at all account for, had come 
                over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had 
                dealt him.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for 
                Rostov, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed 
                to the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George's Cross. 
                When sent for by Count Ostermann, Rostov, remembering that he 
                had charged without orders, felt sure his commander was sending 
                for him to punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann's flattering 
                words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him 
                all the more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable 
                feeling of moral nausea. &quot;But what on earth is worrying me?&quot; 
                he asked himself as he rode back from the general. &quot;Ilyin? 
                No, he's safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that's 
                not it.&quot; Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. 
                &quot;Yes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I 
                remember how my arm paused when I raised it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after 
                them to have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. 
                He was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and 
                looked anxiously about him; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely 
                be called a wound. He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and 
                waved his hand in greeting. Rostov still had the same indefinite 
                feeling, as of shame.</p>
              <p> 　　All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed 
                that Rostov, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, 
                and preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, 
                and kept turning something over in his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of 
                his, which to his amazement had gained him the St. George's Cross 
                and even given him a reputation for bravery, and there was something 
                he could not at all understand. &quot;So others are even more 
                afraid than I am!&quot; he thought. &quot;So that's all there 
                is in what is called heroism! And heroism! And did I do it for 
                my country's sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and 
                blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should 
                kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have 
                given me a St. George's Cross.... I can't make it out at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still 
                could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel 
                of fortune in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. 
                After the affair at Ostrovna he was brought into notice, received 
                command of an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed 
                he was chosen. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the 
                district in connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of 
                which he was trustee. This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov, and 
                in the middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already 
                clothed in green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near 
                water one longed to bathe.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business 
                about which he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the 
                avenue in the grounds of the Rostovs' house at Otradnoe. He heard 
                merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group 
                of girls running to cross the path of his caleche. Ahead of the 
                rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty 
                girl in a yellow chintz dress, with a white handkerchief on her 
                head from under which loose locks of hair escaped. The girl was 
                shouting something but, seeing that he was a stranger, ran back 
                laughing without looking at him.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was 
                so beautiful, the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but 
                that slim pretty girl did not know, or wish to know, of his existence 
                and was contented and cheerful in her own separate- probably foolish- 
                but bright and happy life. &quot;What is she so glad about? What 
                is she thinking of? Not of the military regulations or of the 
                arrangement of the Ryazan serfs' quitrents. Of what is she thinking? 
                Why is she so happy?&quot; Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive 
                curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just as he 
                had done in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole 
                province with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad 
                to see Prince Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted 
                on his staying the night.</p>
              <p> 　　During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained 
                by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors 
                (the old count's house was crowded on account of an approaching 
                name day), Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Natasha, gay and 
                laughing among the younger members of the company, and asked himself 
                each time, &quot;What is she thinking about? Why is she so glad?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable 
                to sleep. He read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit 
                it. It was hot in the room, the inside shutters of which were 
                closed. He was cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rostov), 
                who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents 
                had not yet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself for 
                having stayed.</p>
              <p> 　　He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he 
                opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching 
                for this, burst into the room. He opened the casement. The night 
                was fresh, bright, and very still. Just before the window was 
                a row of pollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery 
                light on the other. Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush, wet, 
                bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there. 
                Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, 
                to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and 
                branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its full, in 
                a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his 
                elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.</p>
              <p> 　　His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above 
                were also awake. He heard female voices overhead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just once more,&quot; said a girlish voice above him 
                which Prince Andrew recognized at once.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But when are you coming to bed?&quot; replied another 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I won't, I can't sleep, what's the use? Come now for 
                the last time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 Two girlish voices sang a musical passage- the end of some 
                song.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there's an end 
                of it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You go to sleep, but I can't,&quot; said the first voice, 
                coming nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, 
                for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. 
                Everything was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the 
                shadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying 
                his unintentional presence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya! Sonya!&quot; he again heard the first speaker. 
                &quot;Oh, how can you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, 
                how glorious! Do wake up, Sonya!&quot; she said almost with tears 
                in her voice. &quot;There never, never was such a lovely night 
                before!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya made some reluctant reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! 
                Come here.... Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? 
                I feel like sitting down on my heels, putting my arms round my 
                knees like this, straining tight, as tight as possible, and flying 
                away! Like this....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take care, you'll fall out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya's disapproving voice: 
                &quot;It's past one o'clock.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still 
                sitting there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at 
                times a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O God, O God! What does it mean?&quot; she suddenly 
                exclaimed. &quot;To bed then, if it must be!&quot; and she slammed 
                the casement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For her I might as well not exist!&quot; thought Prince 
                Andrew while he listened to her voice, for some reason expecting 
                yet fearing that she might say something about him. &quot;There 
                she is again! As if it were on purpose,&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil 
                of youthful thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of 
                his life, that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay 
                down and fell asleep at once. </p>

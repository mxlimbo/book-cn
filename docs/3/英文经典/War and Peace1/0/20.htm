              <p> 　　The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and 
                the count's visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing 
                rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.</p>
              <p> 　　The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty 
                from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at 
                everything. The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered 
                round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played 
                first. After she had played a little air with variations on the 
                harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and 
                <br>
                Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something. 
                Natasha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently 
                very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What shall we sing?&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'The Brook,'&quot; suggested Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then,let's be quick. Boris, come here,&quot; said 
                Natasha. &quot;But where is Sonya?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the 
                room ran to look for her.</p>
              <p> 　　Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha 
                ran to the nursery, but Sonya was not there either. Natasha concluded 
                that she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the 
                passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation 
                in the Rostov household. And there in fact was Sonya lying face 
                downward on Nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, 
                crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with 
                her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare 
                little shoulders shook. Natasha's face, which had been so radiantly 
                happy all that saint's day, suddenly changed: her eyes became 
                fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners 
                of her mouth drooped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... 
                Oo...!&quot; And Natasha's large mouth widened, making her look 
                quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing 
                why, except that Sonya was crying. Sonya tried to lift her head 
                to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the 
                bed. Natasha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and 
                hugging her friend. With an effort Sonya sat up and began wiping 
                her eyes and explaining.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... 
                have come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,&quot; 
                and she showed a paper she held in her hand- with the verses Nicholas 
                had written, &quot;still, I should not cry, but you can't... no 
                one can understand... what a soul he has!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all very well for you... I am not envious... I 
                love you and Boris also,&quot; she went on, gaining a little strength; 
                &quot;he is nice... there are no difficulties in your way.... 
                But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan 
                himself... and even then it can't be done. And besides, if she 
                tells Mamma&quot; (Sonya looked upon the countess as her mother 
                and called her so) &quot;that I am spoiling Nicholas' career and 
                am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,&quot; 
                and she made the sign of the cross, &quot;I love her so much, 
                and all of you, only Vera... And what for? What have I done to 
                her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice 
                everything, only I have nothing....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands 
                and in the feather bed. Natasha began consoling her, but her face 
                showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya,&quot; she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed 
                the true reason of her friend's sorrow, &quot;I'm sure Vera has 
                said something to you since dinner? Hasn't she?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied 
                some others, and she found them on my table and said she'd show 
                them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would 
                never allow him to marry me, but that he'll marry Julie. You see 
                how he's been with her all day... Natasha, what have I done to 
                deserve it?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha 
                lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began 
                comforting her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! 
                Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in 
                the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything 
                was to be. I don't quite remember how, but don't you remember 
                that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There's 
                Uncle Shinshin's brother has married his first cousin. And we 
                are only second cousins, you know. And Boris says it is quite 
                possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so 
                clever and so good!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Don't you cry, Sonya, 
                dear love, darling Sonya!&quot; and she kissed her and laughed. 
                &quot;Vera's spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right 
                and she won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, 
                and he doesn't care at all for Julie.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha kissed her on the hair.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, 
                and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, 
                and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you think so?... Really? Truly?&quot; she said, quickly 
                smoothing her frock and hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really, truly!&quot; answered Natasha, pushing in a 
                crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend's plaits.</p>
              <p> 　　Both laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come along!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is 
                so funny!&quot; said Natasha, stopping suddenly. &quot;I feel 
                so happy!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she set off at a run along the passage.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking 
                away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little 
                chest, ran after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room 
                with flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request 
                the young people sang the quartette, &quot;The Brook,&quot; with 
                which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had 
                just learned: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 At nighttime in the moon's fair glow</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　 How sweet, as fancies wander free,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 To feel that in this world there's one</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　 Who still is thinking but of thee! </p>
              <p> 　　　　 That while her fingers touch the harp</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　 Wafting sweet music music the lea,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 It is for thee thus swells her heart,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　 Sighing its message out to thee... </p>
              <p> 　　　　 A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　 But oh! till then I cannot live!... </p>
              <p> 　　He had not finished the last verse before the young people 
                began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of 
                the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the 
                gallery. </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was sitting in the drawing-room where Shinshin had 
                engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political 
                conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre. 
                When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to 
                Pierre said, laughing and blushing:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am afraid of mixing the figures,&quot; Pierre replied; 
                &quot;but if you will be my teacher...&quot; And lowering his 
                big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.</p>
              <p> 　　While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians 
                tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natasha was 
                perfectly happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had 
                been abroad. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking 
                to him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one 
                of the ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of 
                a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) 
                she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over 
                the fan.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear, dear! Just look at her!&quot; exclaimed the countess 
                as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha blushed and laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to 
                be surprised at?&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of 
                chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and 
                Marya Dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the 
                more distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves 
                after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, 
                entered the ballroom. First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count, 
                both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony 
                somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna. 
                He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face 
                and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he 
                clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, 
                addressing the first violin:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in 
                his youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of 
                the anglaise.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at Papa!&quot; shouted Natasha to the whole company, 
                and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner 
                she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring 
                with her laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure 
                at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and 
                stout partner, Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened 
                his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, 
                and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared 
                the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively 
                gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry 
                peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom 
                were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs- the men on one side 
                and the women on the other- who with beaming faces had come to 
                see their master making merry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!&quot; 
                loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.</p>
              <p> 　　The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not 
                and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, 
                her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to 
                the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined 
                in the dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count's plump 
                figure, in Marya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more 
                and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting 
                more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by 
                the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with 
                which he capered about on his light feet, Marya Dmitrievna produced 
                no less impression by slight exertions- the least effort to move 
                her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot- 
                which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. 
                The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could 
                not attract a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did 
                not even try to do so. All were watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna. 
                Natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them 
                to &quot;look at Papa!&quot; though as it was they never took 
                their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, 
                breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. 
                Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more 
                lightly whirled the count, flying round Marya Dmitrievna, now 
                on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round 
                to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot 
                backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide 
                sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led 
                by Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping 
                their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere,&quot; 
                said the count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That was a Daniel Cooper!&quot; exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, 
                tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily. </p>

              <p> 　　Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother 
                of his love for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The 
                countess, who had long noticed what was going on between them 
                and was expecting this declaration, listened to him in silence 
                and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased, but 
                that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such 
                a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time, felt that his mother 
                was displeased with him and that, despite her love for him, she 
                would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son, she sent 
                for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to 
                inform him of the facts, in her son's presence, but unable to 
                restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the 
                room. The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and 
                beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied that he could 
                not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and evidently 
                disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the countess. 
                In all his encounters with his son, the count was always conscious 
                of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune, 
                and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an 
                heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya. On this occasion, he 
                was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs 
                had not been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya 
                could have been wished for, and that no one but himself with his 
                Mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition 
                of the family finances.</p>
              <p> 　　The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their 
                son again, but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, 
                with a cruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece 
                for trying to catch Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sonya listened 
                silently with downcast eyes to the countess' cruel words, without 
                understanding what was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice 
                everything for her benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished 
                idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, 
                or for whom. She could not help loving the countess and the whole 
                Rostov family, but neither could she help loving Nicholas and 
                knowing that his happiness depended on that love. She was silent 
                and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable 
                and went to have an explanation with his mother. He first implored 
                her to forgive him and Sonya and consent to their marriage, then 
                he threatened that if she molested Sonya he would at once marry 
                her secretly.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her 
                before, replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying 
                without his father's consent, and he could do the same, but that 
                she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, 
                told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him 
                to sell his feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the 
                last time.... But he had no time to utter the decisive word which 
                the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror, 
                and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to 
                them both. He had not time to say it, for Natasha, with a pale 
                and set face, entered the room from the door at which she had 
                been listening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, 
                be quiet, I tell you!...&quot; she almost screamed, so as to drown 
                his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma darling, it's not at all so... my poor, sweet 
                darling,&quot; she said to her mother, who conscious that they 
                had been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror, 
                but in the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not 
                and would not give way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nicholas, I'll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma 
                darling,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at 
                which she was aiming.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter's 
                breast, while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far 
                succeeded that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that 
                Sonya should not be troubled, while he on his side promised not 
                to undertake anything without his parents' knowledge.</p>
              <p> 　　Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the 
                regiment, to retire from the army and return and marry Sonya, 
                Nicholas, serious, sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, 
                but, as it seemed to him, passionately in love, left at the beginning 
                of January to rejoin his regiment.</p>
              <p> 　　After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were 
                more depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental 
                agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still 
                more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not 
                help adopting toward her. The count was more perturbed than ever 
                by the condition of his affairs, which called for some decisive 
                action. Their town house and estate near Moscow had inevitably 
                to be sold, and for this they had to go to Moscow. But the countess' 
                health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, who had borne the first period of separation from 
                her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated 
                and impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which 
                she would have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, 
                with no advantage to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters 
                for the most part irritated her. It hurt her to think that while 
                she lived only in the thought of him, he was living a real life, 
                seeing new places and new people that interested him. The more 
                interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters 
                to him, far from giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome 
                and artificial obligation. She could not write, because she could 
                not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter 
                even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice, smile, 
                and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry letters, 
                to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough 
                copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.</p>
              <p> 　　There was still no improvement in the countess' health, but 
                it was impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natasha's 
                trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince 
                Andrew was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkonski was 
                spending the winter, and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking 
                Sonya and Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

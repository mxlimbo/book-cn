              <p> 　　Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward 
                and then back, and between the two rows, which separated, the 
                Emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck 
                up. Behind him walked his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, 
                bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments 
                of the reception over. The band played the polonaise in vogue 
                at that time on account of the words that had been set to it, 
                beginning: &quot;Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish 
                quite...&quot; The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the 
                crowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited 
                faces hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired 
                from the drawing-room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking 
                to the hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down 
                on the ladies, asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces 
                betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, 
                pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets. The men began 
                to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise.</p>
              <p> 　　Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the 
                drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time 
                to the music. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; 
                then came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya 
                diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners 
                and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for 
                the polonaise. Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother 
                and Sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, 
                not having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms 
                hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, 
                and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight 
                before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. 
                She was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great 
                people whom Peronskaya was pointing out- she had but one thought: 
                &quot;Is it possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among 
                the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men 
                will notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do 
                they look as if they were saying, 'Ah, she's not the one I'm after, 
                so it's not worth looking at her!' No, it's impossible,&quot; 
                she thought. &quot;They must know how I long to dance, how splendidly 
                I dance, and how they would enjoy dancing with me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable 
                time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha's 
                ears. She wanted to cry. Peronskaya had left them. The count was 
                at the other end of the room. She and the countess and Sonya were 
                standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that 
                crowd of strangers, with no one interested in them and not wanted 
                by anyone. Prince Andrew with a lady passed by, evidently not 
                recognizing them. The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to 
                a partner on his arm and looked at Natasha as one looks at a wall. 
                Boris passed them twice and each time turned away. Berg and his 
                wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.</p>
              <p> 　　This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha- as if 
                there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the 
                ball. She did not listen to or look at Vera, who was telling her 
                something about her own green dress.</p>
              <p> 　　At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had 
                danced with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp 
                ran up to the Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though 
                as it was they were already close to the wall, and from the gallery 
                resounded the distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains 
                of a waltz. The Emperor looked smilingly down the room. A minute 
                passed but no one had yet begun dancing. An aide-de-camp, the 
                Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess Bezukhova and asked 
                her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his 
                shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an adept in 
                his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with confident 
                deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of 
                the circle, then at the corner of the room he caught Helene's 
                left hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the 
                ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on 
                his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partner's 
                velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. 
                Natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not 
                she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, 
                wearing stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and 
                bright in the front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs. 
                Baron Firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the 
                Council of State to be held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely 
                connected with Speranski and participating in the work of the 
                legislative commission, could give reliable information about 
                that sitting, concerning which various rumors were current. But 
                not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was gazing now at 
                the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not 
                yet gathered courage to enter the circle.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor's 
                presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked 
                to dance.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You always dance. I have a protegee, the young Rostova, 
                here. Ask her,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is she?&quot; asked Bolkonski. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; 
                he added, turning to the baron, &quot;we will finish this conversation 
                elsewhere- at a ball one must dance.&quot; He stepped forward 
                in the direction Pierre indicated. The despairing, dejected expression 
                of Natasha's face caught his eye. He recognized her, guessed her 
                feelings, saw that it was her debut, remembered her conversation 
                at the window, and with an expression of pleasure on his face 
                approached Countess Rostova.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,&quot; said 
                the countess, with heightened color.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if 
                the countess remembers me,&quot; said Prince Andrew with a low 
                and courteous bow quite belying Peronskaya's remarks about his 
                rudeness, and approaching Natasha he held out his arm to grasp 
                her waist before he had completed his invitation. He asked her 
                to waltz. That tremulous expression on Natasha's face, prepared 
                either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a happy, 
                grateful, childlike smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have long been waiting for you,&quot; that frightened 
                happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the 
                threatened tears, as she raised her hand to Prince Andrew's shoulder. 
                They were the second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew 
                was one of the best dancers of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely. 
                Her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work 
                swiftly, lightly, and independently of herself, while her face 
                beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender bare arms and neck 
                were not beautiful- compared to Helene's her shoulders looked 
                thin and her bosom undeveloped. But Helene seemed, as it were, 
                hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had 
                scanned her person, while Natasha was like a girl exposed for 
                the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she 
                not been assured that this was absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly 
                as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone 
                addressed to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint 
                he disliked, caused by the Emperor's presence, he danced, and 
                had chosen Natasha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because 
                she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely 
                had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring 
                so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm 
                rose to his head, and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated 
                when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching 
                the other dancers. </p>

              <p> 　　An hour and a half later most of the players were but little 
                interested in their own play.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole interest was concentrated on Rostov. Instead of 
                sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored 
                against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that 
                now, as he vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. 
                In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov 
                was no longer listening to stories or telling them, but followed 
                every movement of Rostov's hands and occasionally ran his eyes 
                over the score against him. He had decided to play until that 
                score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number 
                because forty-three was the sum of his and Sonya's joint ages. 
                Rostov, leaning his head on both hands, sat at the table which 
                was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine, and littered 
                with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him: that 
                those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from 
                under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, 
                held him in their power.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning 
                it back's impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The 
                knave, double or quits... it can't be!... And why is he doing 
                this to me?&quot; Rostov pondered. Sometimes he staked a large 
                sum, but Dolokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself. 
                Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment prayed to God as 
                he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns, and 
                then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled 
                heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on 
                his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the 
                total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the 
                other players, or peered at the now cold face of Dolokhov and 
                tried to read what was passing in his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can't 
                want my ruin. Wasn't he my friend? Wasn't I fond of him? But it's 
                not his fault. What's he to do if he has such luck?... And it's 
                not my fault either,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I have 
                done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted or wished 
                harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it 
                begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought 
                of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma's name 
                day and then going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! 
                And I did not realize how happy I was! When did that end and when 
                did this new, terrible state of things begin? What marked the 
                change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table, chose 
                and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in 
                the same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well 
                and strong and still the same and in the same place. No, it can't 
                be! Surely it will all end in nothing!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room 
                was not hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially 
                from its helpless efforts to seem calm.</p>
              <p> 　　The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three 
                thousand. Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner 
                of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to 
                his score, when Dolokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put 
                it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rostov's debt, 
                breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Supper, it's time for supper! And here are the gypsies!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold 
                outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas 
                understood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent 
                tone:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, won't you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,&quot; 
                as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all up! I'm lost!&quot; thought he. &quot;Now a 
                bullet through my brain- that's all that's left me! &quot; And 
                at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come now, just this one more little card!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right!&quot; said Dolokhov, having finished the 
                addition. &quot;All right! Twenty-one rubles,&quot; he said, pointing 
                to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round 
                sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared 
                to deal. Rostov submissively unbent the corner of his card and, 
                instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all the same to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I only 
                want to see whether you will let me win this ten, or beat it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostov detested 
                at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and 
                hairy wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You owe forty-three thousand, Count,&quot; said Dolokhov, 
                and stretching himself he rose from the table. &quot;One does 
                get tired sitting so long,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I'm tired too,&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not 
                for him to jest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When am I to receive the money, Count?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, flushing, drew Dolokhov into the next room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, Rostov,&quot; said Dolokhov clearly, smiling 
                and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, &quot;you know the 
                saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky at cards.' Your cousin is in love 
                with you, I know.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, it's terrible to feel oneself so in this man's power,&quot; 
                thought Rostov. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father 
                and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it 
                would be to escape it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he 
                could save him from all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now 
                to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your cousin...&quot; Dolokhov started to say, but Nicholas 
                interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary 
                to mention her!&quot; he exclaimed fiercely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then when am I to have it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; replied Rostov and left the room. </p>

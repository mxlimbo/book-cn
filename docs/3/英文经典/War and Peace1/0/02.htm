            <td> 　　Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest 
              Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely 
              in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they 
              belonged. Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to 
              take her father to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball 
              dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess 
              Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* 
              was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, 
              and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only 
              to small receptions. Prince Vasili's son, Hippolyte, had come with 
              Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had 
              also come. 
              <p> 　　*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. </p>
              <p> 　　To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, &quot;You have not 
                yet seen my aunt,&quot; or &quot;You do not know my aunt?&quot; 
                and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing 
                large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from 
                another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly 
                turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovna mentioned 
                each one's name and then left them.</p>
              <p> 　　Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt 
                whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and 
                not one of them cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings 
                with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt 
                spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and 
                her own, and the health of Her Majesty, &quot;who, thank God, 
                was better today.&quot; And each visitor, though politeness prevented 
                his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief 
                at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her 
                the whole evening.</p>
              <p> 　　The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a 
                gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which 
                a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her 
                teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially 
                charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower 
                lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, 
                her defect- the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth- 
                seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone 
                brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to 
                become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her 
                burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who 
                looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a 
                little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full 
                of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw 
                her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought 
                that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess went round the table with quick, short, 
                swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out 
                her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all 
                she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. 
                &quot;I have brought my work,&quot; said she in French, displaying 
                her bag and addressing all present. &quot;Mind, Annette, I hope 
                you have not played a wicked trick on me,&quot; she added, turning 
                to her hostess. &quot;You wrote that it was to be quite a small 
                reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.&quot; And she 
                spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty 
                gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier 
                than anyone else,&quot; replied Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know,&quot; said the princess in the same tone of 
                voice and still in French, turning to a general, &quot;my husband 
                is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what 
                this wretched war is for?&quot; she added, addressing Prince Vasili, 
                and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, 
                the beautiful Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a delightful woman this little princess is!&quot; 
                said Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young 
                man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches 
                fashionable <br>
                at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This 
                stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known 
                grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young 
                man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, 
                as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, 
                and this was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted 
                him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing 
                room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety 
                and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited 
                to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though 
                he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, 
                her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, 
                but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him 
                from everyone else in that drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and 
                visit a poor invalid,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an 
                alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to 
                look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt 
                he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an 
                intimate acquaintance.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away 
                from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's 
                health. Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: &quot;Do 
                you know the Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, 
                and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You think so?&quot; rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order 
                to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. 
                But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First 
                he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and 
                now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With 
                his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining 
                his reasons for thinking the abbe's plan chimerical.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We will talk of it later,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna with 
                a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　And having got rid of this young man who did not know how 
                to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to 
                listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation 
                might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when 
                he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle 
                that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise 
                than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in 
                proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing room, 
                approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word 
                or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, 
                proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about 
                Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached 
                the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, 
                and again when he passed to another group whose center was the 
                abbe.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna 
                Pavlovna's was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that 
                all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there 
                and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, 
                afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. 
                Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces 
                of those present he was always expecting to hear something very 
                profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed 
                interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express 
                his own views, as young people are fond of doing.</p>

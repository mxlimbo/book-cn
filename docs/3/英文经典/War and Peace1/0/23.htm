              <p> 　　Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an 
                arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the 
                room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead 
                on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, 
                was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church 
                during evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long 
                invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, 
                evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw- covered to the waist by 
                a bright green quilt- the familiar, majestic figure of his father, 
                Count Bezukhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead 
                which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically 
                noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under 
                the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the right 
                hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust 
                between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over 
                from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood 
                the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering 
                vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly 
                conducting the service. A little behind them stood the two younger 
                princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front 
                of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined 
                look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that 
                she could not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna 
                Mikhaylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression 
                on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady. Prince Vasili 
                in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his 
                left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet 
                chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself 
                with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched 
                his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation 
                to the will of God. &quot;If you do not understand these sentiments,&quot; 
                he seemed to be saying, &quot;so much the worse for you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; 
                the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently 
                crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the 
                subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs 
                and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. 
                Anna Mikhaylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she 
                felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to 
                where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, 
                distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself 
                with the hand that held the taper.</p>
              <p> 　　Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with 
                the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, 
                and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing 
                Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to 
                look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at 
                him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one 
                of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the 
                priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the 
                old servant who was holding the count's hand got up and said something 
                to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna stepped forward and, stooping 
                over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. 
                The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of 
                the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, 
                in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance 
                of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He now 
                approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full 
                vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the 
                green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt 
                the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something 
                to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed 
                their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre 
                noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had been 
                leaning, and- with air which intimated that he knew what he was 
                about and if others did not understand him it was so much the 
                worse for them- did not go up to the dying man, but passed by 
                him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side 
                of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. 
                On leaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed 
                out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the 
                other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention 
                to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made 
                up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him 
                that evening was in some way essential.</p>
              <p> 　　The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest 
                was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having 
                received the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable 
                as before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible 
                and whispers, among which Anna Mikhaylovna's was the most distinct.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre heard her say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will 
                be impossible...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and 
                servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face 
                with its gray mane- which, though he saw other faces as well, 
                he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole 
                service. He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded 
                round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and 
                were moving him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!&quot; he heard 
                one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. &quot;Catch hold 
                from underneath. Here!&quot; exclaimed different voices; and the 
                heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet 
                grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too 
                much for them.</p>
              <p> 　　As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed the 
                young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and 
                backs of the dying man's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful 
                shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, 
                and of his gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably 
                broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its 
                cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach 
                of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months 
                before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now this 
                head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, 
                and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　After a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those 
                who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched 
                Pierre's hand and said, &quot;Come.&quot; Pierre went with her 
                to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose 
                in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head 
                propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed 
                on the green silk quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came 
                up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance 
                of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look 
                meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look 
                somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing 
                what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna 
                made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man's 
                hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully 
                stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her 
                suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. 
                Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count's face stirred. 
                Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see 
                what he was to do next. Anna Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated 
                a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, 
                his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikhaylovna nodded 
                approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose 
                of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and 
                clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look 
                as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed 
                at the spot where Pierre's face had been before he sat down. Anna 
                Mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the 
                pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the 
                father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre 
                seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's 
                face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth 
                was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death 
                his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, 
                hoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick 
                man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first 
                to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an 
                inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face 
                of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at 
                the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wants to turn on the other side,&quot; whispered the 
                servant, and got up to turn the count's heavy body toward the 
                wall.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre rose to help him.</p>
              <p> 　　While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell 
                back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. 
                Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded 
                that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across 
                his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, 
                at Pierre's terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on 
                his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping 
                with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. 
                At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in 
                his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. 
                The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. 
                He sighed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is dozing,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna, observing 
                that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. 
                &quot;Let us go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went out.</p>

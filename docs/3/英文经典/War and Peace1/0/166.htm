              <p> 　　Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment 
                of her wish that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow. The whole 
                house was in a state of alarm and commotion. Natasha was very 
                ill, having, as Marya Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned 
                herself the night after she had been told that Anatole was married, 
                with some arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing 
                a little she had been so frightened that she woke Sonya and told 
                her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had been administered 
                in time and she was now out of danger, though still so weak that 
                it was out of the question to move her to the country, and so 
                the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, 
                and Sonya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip 
                about the attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied 
                these rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except 
                that his brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. 
                It seemed to Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole 
                affair and re-establish Natasha's reputation.</p>
              <p> 　　He was awaiting Prince Andrew's return with dread and went 
                every day to the old prince's for news of him.</p>
              <p> 　　Old Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town 
                from Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess 
                Mary in which Natasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed 
                in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience.</p>
              <p> 　　Some days after Anatole's departure Pierre received a note 
                from Prince Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him 
                to come to see him.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from 
                his father Natasha's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement 
                (Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and 
                given it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of 
                Natasha's elopement, with additions.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to 
                see him next morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in 
                almost the same state as Natasha and was therefore surprised on 
                entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in 
                a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg. 
                The old prince's voice and another now and then interrupted him. 
                Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She sighed, looking toward 
                the door of the room where Prince Andrew was, evidently intending 
                to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her 
                face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way 
                her brother had taken the news of Natasha's faithlessness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He says he expected it,&quot; she remarked. &quot;I 
                know his pride will not let him express his feelings, but still 
                he has taken it better, far better, than I expected. Evidently 
                it had to be....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But is it possible that all is really ended?&quot; asked 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not 
                understand how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into 
                the study. Prince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better 
                health, but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows, 
                stood in civilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshcherski, 
                warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating. The conversation 
                was about Speranski- the news of whose sudden exile and alleged 
                treachery had just reached Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic 
                about him a month ago,&quot; Prince Andrew was saying, &quot;and 
                by those who were unable to understand his aims. To judge a man 
                who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other 
                men's mistakes is very easy, but I maintain that if anything good 
                has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him, by him 
                alone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately 
                assumed a vindictive expression.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Posterity will do him justice,&quot; he concluded, and 
                at once turned to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?&quot; he said 
                with animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. 
                &quot;Yes, I am well,&quot; he said in answer to Pierre's question, 
                and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　To Pierre that smile said plainly: &quot;I am well, but my 
                health is now of no use to anyone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the 
                Polish frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew 
                Pierre, and about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad 
                to be his son's tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the 
                conversation about Speranski which was still going on between 
                the two old men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations 
                with Napoleon, they would have been made public,&quot; he said 
                with warmth and haste. &quot;I do not, and never did, like Speranski 
                personally, but I like justice!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was 
                only too familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about 
                extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive 
                and too intimate. When Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew 
                took Pierre's arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned 
                him. A bed had been made up there, and some open portmanteaus 
                and trunks stood about. Prince Andrew went to one and took out 
                a small casket, from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper. 
                He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. 
                His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forgive me for troubling you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha, 
                and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression 
                irritated Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant 
                tone he continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and 
                have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, 
                or something of that kind. Is that true?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Both true and untrue,&quot; Pierre began; but Prince 
                Andrew interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here are her letters and her portrait,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give this to the countess... if you see her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is very ill,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then she is here still?&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;And 
                Prince Kuragin?&quot; he added quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He left long ago. She has been at death's door.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I much regret her illness,&quot; said Prince Andrew; 
                and he smiled like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova 
                with his hand?&quot; said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several 
                times.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He could not marry, for he was married already,&quot; 
                said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of 
                his father.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has gone to Peters... But I don't know,&quot; said 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, it doesn't matter,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Tell 
                Countess Rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that I 
                wish her all that is good.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember 
                whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre 
                would say anything, looked fixedly at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?&quot; 
                asked Pierre, &quot;about...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Prince Andrew hastily. &quot;I said 
                that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I didn't say I could 
                forgive her. I can't.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But can this be compared...?&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: &quot;Yes, 
                ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would 
                be very noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman's footsteps. 
                If you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all 
                that! Well, good-by. So you'll give her the packet?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess 
                Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was 
                the same as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, 
                Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken 
                off. Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity 
                they all felt for the Rostovs, and that it was impossible in their 
                presence even to mention the name of her who could give up Prince 
                Andrew for anyone else.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which 
                was becoming evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing 
                now with his father, now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing 
                an unnatural animation, the cause of which Pierre so well understood.

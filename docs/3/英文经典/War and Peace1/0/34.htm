              <p> 　　Kutuzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the 
                bridges over the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). 
                On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. 
                At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns 
                of troops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides 
                of the bridge.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that 
                opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood 
                guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain 
                of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, 
                far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though 
                freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with 
                its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on 
                both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. 
                At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with 
                a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns 
                and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the 
                Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of 
                green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood 
                out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other 
                side of the Enns the enemy's horse patrols could be discerned.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in 
                command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning 
                the country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvitski, 
                who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, 
                was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied 
                him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvitski was treating 
                some officers to pies and real doppelkummel. The officers gladly 
                gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish 
                fashion on the wet grass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no 
                fool. It's a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?&quot; 
                Nesvitski was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you very much, Prince,&quot; answered one of the 
                officers, pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. 
                &quot;It's a lovely place! We passed close to the park and saw 
                two deer... and what a splendid house!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look, Prince,&quot; said another, who would have dearly 
                liked to take another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended 
                to be examining the countryside- &quot;See, our infantrymen have 
                already got there. Look there in the meadow behind the village, 
                three of them are dragging something. They'll ransack that castle,&quot; 
                he remarked with evident approval.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So they will,&quot; said Nesvitski. &quot;No, but what 
                I should like,&quot; added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped 
                handsome mouth, &quot;would be to slip in over there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes 
                narrowed and gleamed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That would be fine, gentlemen!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officers laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian 
                girls among them. On my word I'd give five years of my life for 
                it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They must be feeling dull, too,&quot; said one of the 
                bolder officers, laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out 
                something to the general, who looked through his field glass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, so it is, so it is,&quot; said the general angrily, 
                lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, &quot;so 
                it is! They'll be fired on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling 
                there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked 
                eye, and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came 
                the distant report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying 
                to the crossing.</p>
              <p> 　　Nesvitski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a bad business,&quot; said the general without 
                answering him, &quot;our men have been wasting time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hadn't I better ride over, your excellency?&quot; asked 
                Nesvitski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, please do,&quot; answered the general, and he repeated 
                the order that had already once been given in detail: &quot;and 
                tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge 
                as I ordered; and the inflammable material on the bridge must 
                be reinspected.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very good,&quot; answered Nesvitski.</p>
              <p> 　　He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away 
                the knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into 
                the saddle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll really call in on the nuns,&quot; he said to the 
                officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding 
                path down the hill.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, let's see how far it will carry, Captain. 
                Just try!&quot; said the general, turning to an artillery officer. 
                &quot;Have a little fun to pass the time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Crew, to your guns!&quot; commanded the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires 
                and began loading.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One!&quot; came the command.</p>
              <p> 　　Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening 
                metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of 
                our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little 
                smoke showing the spot where it burst.</p>
              <p> 　　The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. 
                Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops 
                below, as plainly visible as if but a stone's throw away, and 
                the movements of the approaching enemy farther off. At the same 
                instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the 
                clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright 
                sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression.</p>

              <p> 　　During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew 
                felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life 
                of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed 
                him in that city.</p>
              <p> 　　On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his 
                notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain 
                hours. The mechanism of life, the arrangement of the day so as 
                to be in time everywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital 
                energy. He did nothing, did not even think or find time to think, 
                but only talked, and talked successfully, of what he had thought 
                while in the country.</p>
              <p> 　　He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated 
                the same remark on the same day in different circles. But he was 
                so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice 
                that he was thinking of nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey's, Speranski 
                produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, 
                when he received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to 
                him long and confidentially.</p>
              <p> 　　To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant 
                creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal 
                of that perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed 
                that in Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational 
                and virtuous man. Had Speranski sprung from the same class as 
                himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolkonski 
                would soon have discovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; but 
                as it was, Speranski's strange and logical turn of mind inspired 
                him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand 
                him. Moreover, Speranski, either because he appreciated the other's 
                capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his 
                side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before 
                Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which 
                goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit 
                assumption that one's companion is the only man besides oneself 
                capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and 
                the reasonableness and profundity of one's own ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speranski 
                more than once remarked: &quot;We regard everything that is above 
                the common level of rooted custom...&quot; or, with a smile: &quot;But 
                we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe...&quot; 
                or: &quot;They cannot understand this...&quot; and all in a way 
                that seemed to say: &quot;We, you and I, understand what they 
                are and who we are.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened 
                in Prince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at 
                their first meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking 
                man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained 
                power, which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In 
                Prince Andrew's eyes Speranski was the man he would himself have 
                wished to be- one who explained all the facts of life reasonably, 
                considered important only what was rational, and was capable of 
                applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything seemed 
                so simple and clear in Speranski's exposition that Prince Andrew 
                involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied 
                and argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence 
                and not submit to Speranski's opinions entirely. Everything was 
                right and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted 
                Prince Andrew. This was Speranski's cold, mirrorlike look, which 
                did not allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white 
                hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch 
                the hands of those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and 
                those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. 
                He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for 
                others that he observed in Speranski, and by the diversity of 
                lines of argument he used to support his opinions. He made use 
                of every kind of mental device, except analogy, and passed too 
                boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one to another. Now he 
                would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers; 
                now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his opponents; 
                now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. 
                (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.) He would 
                transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions 
                of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the refutation 
                he needed, would again descend to the level of the original discussion.</p>
              <p> 　　In general the trait of Speranski's mentality which struck 
                Prince Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the 
                power and authority of reason. It was evident that the thought 
                could never occur to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, 
                namely, that it is after all impossible to express all one thinks; 
                and that he had never felt the doubt, &quot;Is not all I think 
                and believe nonsense?&quot; And it was just this peculiarity of 
                Speranski's mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt 
                a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once 
                felt for Bonaparte. The fact that Speranski was the son of a village 
                priest, and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account 
                of his humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew 
                to cherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to 
                strengthen it.</p>
              <p> 　　On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having mentioned 
                the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speranski 
                told him sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred 
                and fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except 
                that Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs 
                of the different codes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And that is all the state has for the millions it has 
                spent,&quot; said he. &quot;We want to give the Senate new juridical 
                powers, but we have no laws. That is why it is a sin for men like 
                you, Prince, not to serve in these times!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence 
                was needed which he did not possess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It 
                is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on 
                Army Regulations and- what he had not at all expected- was chairman 
                of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At 
                Speranski's request he took the first part of the Civil Code that 
                was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and 
                the Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section 
                on Personal Rights.</p>

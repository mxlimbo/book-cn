              <p> 　　Does it ever happen to you,&quot; said Natasha to her brother, 
                when they settled down in the sitting room, &quot;does it ever 
                happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come- nothing; 
                that everything good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but 
                sad?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should think so!&quot; he replied. &quot;I have felt 
                like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. 
                The thought has come into my mind that I was already tired of 
                it all, and that we must all die. Once in the regiment I had not 
                gone to some merrymaking where there was music... and suddenly 
                I felt so depressed...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!&quot; Natasha interrupted 
                him. &quot;When I was quite little that used to be so with me. 
                Do you remember when I was punished once about some plums? You 
                were all dancing, and I sat sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall 
                never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for everyone, for myself, 
                and for everyone. And I was innocent- that was the chief thing,&quot; 
                said Natasha. &quot;Do you remember?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I remember,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;I remember 
                that I came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do 
                you know, I felt ashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a 
                funny doll then and wanted to give it to you. Do you remember?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you remember,&quot; Natasha asked with a pensive 
                smile, &quot;how once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, 
                Uncle called us into the study- that was in the old house- and 
                it was dark- we went in and suddenly there stood...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A Negro,&quot; chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. 
                &quot;Of course I remember. Even now I don't know whether there 
                really was a Negro, or if we only dreamed it or were told about 
                him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and 
                stood and looked at us...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, do you remember?&quot; asked Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, I do remember something too,&quot; Sonya answered 
                timidly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,&quot; 
                said Natasha, &quot;and they say there was no Negro at all. But 
                you see, you remember!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just 
                seen them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How strange it is! It's as if it were a dream! I like 
                that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in 
                the ballroom, and suddenly two old women began spinning round 
                on the carpet? Was that real or not? Do you remember what fun 
                it was?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat 
                fired a gun in the porch?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: 
                not the sad memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones- those 
                impressions of one's most distant past in which dreams and realities 
                blend- and they laughed with quiet enjoyment.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though 
                they shared the same reminiscences.</p>
              <p> 　　Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what 
                she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. 
                She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.</p>
              <p> 　　She only really took part when they recalled Sonya's first 
                arrival. She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because 
                he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, 
                too, would be sewn up with cords.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I remember their telling me that you had been born 
                under a cabbage,&quot; said Natasha, and I remember that I dared 
                not disbelieve it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt 
                so uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other 
                door of the sitting room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They have brought the cock, Miss,&quot; she said in 
                a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It isn't wanted, Petya. Tell them to take it away,&quot; 
                replied Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came 
                in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took 
                off its cloth covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,&quot; 
                came the old countess' voice from the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, Nicholas, 
                and Sonya, remarked: &quot;How quiet you young people are!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we're philosophizing,&quot; said Natasha, glancing 
                round for a moment and then continuing the conversation. They 
                were now discussing dreams.</p>
              <p> 　　Dimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly 
                to the table, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, 
                seating herself quietly in her former place. It was dark in the 
                room especially where they were sitting on the sofa, but through 
                the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the 
                floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running 
                his fingers over the strings, evidently uncertain whether to stop 
                or to play something else.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know,&quot; said Natasha in a whisper, moving 
                closer to Nicholas and Sonya, &quot;that when one goes on and 
                on recalling memories, one at last begins to remember what happened 
                before one was in the world...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is metempsychosis,&quot; said Sonya, who had always 
                learned well, and remembered everything. &quot;The Egyptians believed 
                that our souls have lived in animals, and will go back into animals 
                again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I don't believe we ever were in animals,&quot; said 
                Natasha, still in a whisper though the music had ceased. &quot;But 
                I am certain that we were angels somewhere there, and have been 
                here, and that is why we remember....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I join you?&quot; said Dimmler who had come up quietly, 
                and he sat down by them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?&quot; 
                said Nicholas. &quot;No, that can't be!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know 
                what I was before?&quot; Natasha rejoined with conviction. &quot;The 
                soul is immortal- well then, if I shall always live I must have 
                lived before, lived for a whole eternity.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,&quot; 
                remarked Dimmler, who had joined the young folk with a mildly 
                condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as 
                they.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is it hard to imagine eternity?&quot; said Natasha. 
                &quot;It is now today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and 
                there was yesterday, and the day before...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha! Now it's your turn. Sing me something,&quot; 
                they heard the countess say. &quot;Why are you sitting there like 
                conspirators?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, I don't at all want to,&quot; replied Natasha, 
                but all the same she rose.</p>
              <p> 　　None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to 
                break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting 
                room, but Natasha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. 
                Standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place 
                where the resonance was best, Natasha began to sing her mother's 
                favorite song.</p>
              <p> 　　She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since 
                she had sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that 
                evening. The count, from his study where he was talking to Mitenka, 
                heard her and, like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, 
                blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward, and 
                at last stopped, while Mitenka stood in front of him also listening 
                and smiling. Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and 
                drew breath in time with her. Sonya, as she listened, thought 
                of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend, 
                and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching 
                as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile 
                and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She 
                thought of Natasha and of her own youth, and of how there was 
                something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of 
                Natasha and Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened 
                with closed eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Countess,&quot; he said at last, &quot;that's a 
                European talent, she has nothing to learn- what softness, tenderness, 
                and strength....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!&quot; 
                said the countess, not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her 
                maternal instinct told her that Natasha had too much of something, 
                and that because of this she would not be happy. Before Natasha 
                had finished singing, fourteen-year-old Petya rushed in delightedly, 
                to say that some mummers had arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha stopped abruptly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Idiot!&quot; she screamed at her brother and, running 
                to a chair, threw herself on it, sobbing so violently that she 
                could not stop for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's nothing, Mamma, really it's nothing; only Petya 
                startled me,&quot; she said, trying to smile, but her tears still 
                flowed and sobs still choked her.</p>
              <p> 　　The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, 
                Turks, innkeepers, and ladies- frightening and funny- bringing 
                in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, 
                at first timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another 
                they pushed into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more 
                and more merrily and heartily, they started singing, dancing, 
                and playing Christmas games. The countess, when she had identified 
                them and laughed at their costumes, went into the drawing room. 
                The count sat in the ballroom, smiling radiantly and applauding 
                the players. The young people had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers 
                in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt- this was Nicholas. 
                A Turkish girl was Petya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natasha, 
                and a Circassian was Sonya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.</p>
              <p> 　　After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, 
                from those who were not themselves dressed up, the young people 
                decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be 
                shown elsewhere.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted 
                to take them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with 
                them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to &quot;Uncle's.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, why disturb the old fellow?&quot; said the countess. 
                &quot;Besides, you wouldn't have room to turn round there. If 
                you must go, go to the Melyukovs'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Melyukova was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors 
                and governesses, lived three miles from the Rostovs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's right, my dear,&quot; chimed in the old count, 
                thoroughly aroused. &quot;I'll dress up at once and go with them. 
                I'll make Pashette open her eyes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had 
                a bad leg all these last days. It was decided that the count must 
                not go, but that if Louisa Ivanovna (Madame Schoss) would go with 
                them, the young ladies might go to the Melyukovs', Sonya, generally 
                so timid and shy, more urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivanovna 
                not to refuse.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya's costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows 
                were extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very 
                handsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual 
                with her. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate 
                would be decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different 
                person. Louisa Ivanovna consented to go, and in half an hour four 
                troyka sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking 
                and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, 
                passing from one to another, grew stronger and stronger and reached 
                its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into 
                the sleighs, talking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting.</p>
              <p> 　　Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third 
                was the old count's with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft 
                horse, the fourth was Nicholas' own with a short shaggy black 
                shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old lady's dress over which he had 
                belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, 
                reins in hand.</p>
              <p> 　　It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected 
                from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, 
                who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow 
                of the porch roof.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas' 
                sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Petya, into the old count's, and 
                the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You go ahead, Zakhar!&quot; shouted Nicholas to his 
                father's coachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.</p>
              <p> 　　The old count's troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started 
                forward, squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, 
                its deep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against 
                the shafts of the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry 
                and glittered like sugar, and threw it up.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the 
                others moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove 
                at a steady trot along the narrow road. While they drove past 
                the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the 
                road and hid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were 
                past the fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless 
                spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with 
                bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle 
                hole in the snow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted 
                in the same way, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, 
                the troykas began to speed along the road, one after the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A hare's track, a lot of tracks!&quot; rang out Natasha's 
                voice through the frost-bound air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How light it is, Nicholas!&quot; came Sonya's voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her 
                face closer. Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches 
                peeped up at him from her sable furs- so close and yet so distant- 
                in the moonlight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That used to be Sonya,&quot; thought he, and looked 
                at her closer and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it, Nicholas?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing,&quot; said he and turned again to the horses.</p>
              <p> 　　When they came out onto the beaten highroad- polished by sleigh 
                runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were 
                visible in the moonlight- the horses began to tug at the reins 
                of their own accord and increased their pace. The near side horse, 
                arching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his 
                traces. The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears 
                as if asking: &quot;Isn't it time to begin now?&quot; In front, 
                already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther 
                and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakhar could be clearly 
                seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the 
                shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gee up, my darlings!&quot; shouted Nicholas, pulling 
                the reins to one side and flourishing the whip.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks 
                given by the side horses who pulled harder- ever increasing their 
                gallop- that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas 
                looked back. With screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused 
                even the shaft horses to gallop- the other sleighs followed. The 
                shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head, with 
                no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill 
                and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near 
                a river.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are we?&quot; thought he. &quot;It's the Kosoy 
                meadow, I suppose. But no- this is something new I've never seen 
                before. This isn't the Kosoy meadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven 
                only knows what it is! It is something new and enchanted. Well, 
                whatever it may be...&quot; And shouting to his horses, he began 
                to pass the first sleigh.</p>
              <p> 　　Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was 
                already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhar, stretching 
                out his arms, clucked his tongue and let his horses go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, look out, master!&quot; he cried.</p>
              <p> 　　Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster 
                moved the feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to 
                draw ahead. Zakhar, while still keeping his arms extended, raised 
                one hand with the reins.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No you won't, master!&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar. 
                The horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in 
                the sleigh- beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught 
                confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the 
                troyka they were passing. The whistling sound of the runners on 
                the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different 
                sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They 
                were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and 
                spangled with stars.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but 
                why to the left?&quot; thought Nicholas. &quot;Are we getting 
                to the Melyukovs'? Is this Melyukovka? Heaven only knows where 
                we are going, and heaven knows what is happening to us- but it 
                is very strange and pleasant whatever it is.&quot; And he looked 
                round in the sleigh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!&quot; 
                said one of the strange, pretty, unfamiliar people- the one with 
                fine eyebrows and mustache.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think this used to be Natasha,&quot; thought Nicholas, 
                &quot;and that was Madame Schoss, but perhaps it's not, and this 
                Circassian with the mustache I don't know, but I love her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aren't you cold?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh 
                behind shouted something- probably something funny- but they could 
                not make out what he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; some voices answered, laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, 
                and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the 
                silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. 
                And if this is really Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we 
                drove heaven knows where and have come to Melyukovka,&quot; thought 
                Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　It really was Melyukovka, and maids and footmen with merry 
                faces came running, out to the porch carrying candles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is it?&quot; asked someone in the porch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The mummers from the count's. I know by the horses,&quot; 
                replied some voices. </p>

              <p> 　　Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg 
                and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night 
                after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, 
                remained in his father's room, that huge room in which Count Bezukhov 
                had died.</p>
              <p> 　　He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget 
                all that had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm 
                of feelings, thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him 
                that he could not fall asleep, nor even remain in one place, but 
                had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps. Now he seemed 
                to see her in the early days of their marriage, with bare shoulders 
                and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then immediately 
                he saw beside her Dolokhov's handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking 
                face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face 
                pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled 
                and sank on the snow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What has happened?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;I have 
                killed her lover, yes, killed my wife's lover. Yes, that was it! 
                And why? How did I come to do it?&quot;- &quot;Because you married 
                her,&quot; answered an inner voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But in what was I to blame?&quot; he asked. &quot;In 
                marrying her without loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.&quot; 
                And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vasili's, 
                when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter: 
                &quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;It all comes from that! Even then 
                I felt it,&quot; he thought. &quot;I felt then that it was not 
                so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection. 
                Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection 
                of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom 
                into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown 
                and found his head steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked 
                into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as 
                if expressing respectful understanding of his employer's happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her 
                majestic beauty and social tact,&quot; thought he; &quot;been 
                proud of my house, in which she received all Petersburg, proud 
                of her unapproachability and beauty. So this is what I was proud 
                of! I then thought that I did not understand her. How often when 
                considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame 
                for not understanding her, for not understanding that constant 
                composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires, 
                and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a 
                depraved woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself 
                all has become clear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used 
                to kiss her naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but 
                let herself be kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, 
                and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as 
                to be jealous: 'Let him do what he pleases,' she used to say of 
                me. One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy. 
                She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want 
                to have children, and that she was not going to have any children 
                by me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts 
                and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, 
                though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous 
                promener,&quot;* she used to say. Often seeing the success she 
                had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand 
                why he did not love her. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;You clear out of this.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I never loved her,&quot; said he to himself; &quot;I 
                knew she was a depraved woman,&quot; he repeated, &quot;but dared 
                not admit it to myself. And now there's Dolokhov sitting in the 
                snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse 
                with some forced bravado!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance 
                of what is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their 
                troubles. He digested his sufferings alone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is all, all her fault,&quot; he said to himself; 
                &quot;but what of that? Why did I bind myself to her? Why did 
                I say 'Je vous aime'* to her, which was a lie, and worse than 
                a lie? I am guilty and must endure... what? A slur on my name? 
                A misfortune for life? Oh, that's nonsense,&quot; he thought. 
                &quot;The slur on my name and honor- that's all apart from myself. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*I love you. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable 
                and a criminal,&quot; came into Pierre's head, &quot;and from 
                their point of view they were right, as were those too who canonized 
                him and died a martyr's death for his sake. Then Robespierre was 
                beheaded for being a despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No 
                one! But if you are alive- live: tomorrow you'll die as I might 
                have died an hour ago. And is it worth tormenting oneself, when 
                one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such 
                reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the 
                moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love 
                for her, and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again 
                to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his 
                hand. &quot;Why did I tell her that 'Je vous aime'?&quot; he kept 
                repeating to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time, 
                Molibre's words: &quot;Mais que diable alloit-il faire dans cette 
                galere?&quot; occurred to him, and he began to laugh at himself.</p>
              <p> 　　In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to 
                go to Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her 
                now. He resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing 
                her of his intention to part from her forever.</p>
              <p> 　　Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, 
                Pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression, 
                unable to realize where he was.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency 
                was at home,&quot; said the valet.</p>
              <p> 　　But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, 
                the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered 
                with silver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice 
                round her lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and 
                majestic, except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather 
                prominent marble brow. With her imperturbable calm she did not 
                begin to speak in front of the valet. She knew of the duel and 
                had come to speak about it. She waited till the valet had set 
                down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked at her 
                timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds 
                who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before 
                her enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to 
                be senseless and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. 
                She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, 
                waiting for the valet to go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what's this now? What have you been up to now, 
                I should like to know?&quot; she asked sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? What have I...?&quot; stammered Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it seems you're a hero, eh? Come now, what was this 
                duel about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, 
                but could not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you won't answer, I'll tell you...&quot; Helene went 
                on. &quot;You believe everything you're told. You were told...&quot; 
                Helene laughed, &quot;that Dolokhov was my lover,&quot; she said 
                in French with her coarse plainness of speech, uttering the word 
                amant as casually as any other word, &quot;and you believed it! 
                Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you're 
                a fool, que vous etes un sot, but everybody knew that. What will 
                be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, 
                that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you 
                were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.&quot; 
                Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited, &quot;A 
                man who's a better man than you in every way...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hm... Hm...!&quot; growled Pierre, frowning without 
                looking at her, and not moving a muscle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because 
                I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I 
                should prefer yours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't speak to me... I beg you,&quot; muttered Pierre 
                hoarsely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why shouldn't I speak? I can speak as I like, and I 
                tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such 
                as you who would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have 
                not done so,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose 
                strange expression she did not understand, and lay down again. 
                He was suffering physically at that moment, there was a weight 
                on his chest and he could not breathe. He knew that he must do 
                something to put an end to this suffering, but what he wanted 
                to do was too terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We had better separate,&quot; he muttered in a broken 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,&quot; 
                said Helene. &quot;Separate! That's a thing to frighten me with!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll kill you!&quot; he shouted, and seizing the marble 
                top of a table with a strength he had never before felt, he made 
                a step toward her brandishing the slab.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene's face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. 
                His father's nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination 
                and delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping 
                down on her with outstretched hands shouted, &quot;Get out!&quot; 
                in such a terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. 
                God knows what he would have done at that moment had Helene not 
                fled from the room. </p>
              <p> 　　A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all 
                his estates in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his 
                property, and left for Petersburg alone. </p>

              <p> 　　Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova, a broadly built, energetic woman 
                wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, 
                surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling 
                dull. They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking 
                at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they 
                heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.</p>
              <p> 　　Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing 
                their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the 
                vestibule, came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly 
                lighted. The clown- Dimmler- and the lady- Nicholas- started a 
                dance. Surrounded by the screaming children the mummers, covering 
                their faces and disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess 
                and arranged themselves about the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And Natasha! See 
                whom she looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr 
                Dimmler- isn't he good! I didn't know him! And how he dances. 
                Dear me, there's a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear 
                Sonya. And who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! Nikita and 
                Vanya- clear away the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. 
                Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the 
                legs!... I can't look at him...&quot; different voices were saying.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, the young Melyukovs' favorite, disappeared with them 
                into the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and 
                male garments were called for and received from the footman by 
                bare girlish arms from behind the door. Ten minutes later, all 
                the young Melyukovs joined the mummers.</p>
              <p> 　　Pelageya Danilovna, having given orders to clear the rooms 
                for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry 
                and the serfs, went about among the mummers without removing her 
                spectacles, peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and 
                failing to recognize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler and 
                the Rostovs she failed to recognize, she did not even recognize 
                her own daughters, or her late husband's, dressing gowns and uniforms, 
                which they had put on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And who is is this?&quot; she asked her governess, peering 
                into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a Kazan-Tartar. 
                &quot;I suppose it is one of the Rostovs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and 
                what regiment do you serve in?&quot; she asked Natasha. &quot;Here, 
                hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!&quot; she ordered the butler 
                who was handing things round. &quot;That's not forbidden by his 
                law.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers 
                cut by the dancers, who- having decided once for all that being 
                disguised, no one would recognize them- were not at all shy, Pelageya 
                Danilovna hid her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout 
                body shook with irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My little Sasha! Look at Sasha!&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　After Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelageya Danilovna 
                made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a 
                string, and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games 
                together.</p>
              <p> 　　In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. 
                The corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, 
                flushed, and merry faces. Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize 
                the mummers, admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly 
                how they suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for 
                having entertained her so well. The visitors were invited to supper 
                in the drawing room, and the serfs had something served to them 
                in the ballroom.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now to tell one's fortune in the empty bathhouse is 
                frightening!&quot; said an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs, 
                during supper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot; said the eldest Melyukov girl.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You wouldn't go, it takes courage...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell what happened to the young lady!&quot; said the 
                second Melyukov girl.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; began the old maid, &quot;a young lady once 
                went out, took a cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and 
                sat down. After sitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... 
                a sleigh drives up with harness bells; she hears him coming! He 
                comes in, just in the shape of a man, like an officer- comes in 
                and sits down to table with her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; screamed Natasha, rolling her eyes with 
                horror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes? And how... did he speak?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he 
                began persuading her; and she should have kept him talking till 
                cockcrow, but she got frightened, just got frightened and hid 
                her face in her hands. Then he caught her up. It was lucky the 
                maids ran in just then...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, why frighten them?&quot; said Pelageya Danilovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...&quot; said 
                her daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how does one do it in a barn?&quot; inquired Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It 
                depends on what you hear; hammering and knocking- that's bad; 
                but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears 
                that, too.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pelageya Danilovna smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, I've forgotten...&quot; she replied. &quot;But none 
                of you would go?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I will; Pelageya Danilovna, let me! I'll go,&quot; 
                said Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, why not, if you're not afraid?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Louisa Ivanovna, may I?&quot; asked Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the 
                ruble game or talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya's side, 
                and gazed at her with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it 
                was only today, thanks to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had 
                fully learned to know her. And really, that evening, Sonya was 
                brighter, more animated, and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen 
                her before.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So that's what she is like; what a fool I have been!&quot; 
                he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache 
                a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never 
                seen before.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm not afraid of anything,&quot; said Sonya. &quot;May 
                I go at once?&quot; She got up.</p>
              <p> 　　They told her where the barn was and how she should stand 
                and listen, and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over 
                her head and shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a darling that girl is!&quot; thought he. &quot;And 
                what have I been thinking of till now?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas 
                went hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd 
                of people really had made the house stuffy.</p>
              <p> 　　Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, 
                but even brighter than before. The light was so strong and the 
                snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look 
                up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed. The sky was black 
                and dreary, while the earth was gay.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?&quot; 
                thought Nicholas. and running out from the porch he went round 
                the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back 
                porch. He knew Sonya would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered 
                piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows 
                from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path. 
                This path led to the barn. The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered 
                roof, that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone, sparkled 
                in the moonlight. A tree in the garden snapped with the frost, 
                and then all was again perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale 
                not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.</p>
              <p> 　　From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the 
                steps, the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing 
                creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying, &quot;Straight, 
                straight, along the path, Miss. Only, don't look back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not afraid,&quot; answered Sonya's voice, and along 
                the path toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of 
                Sonya's feet in her thin shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple 
                of paces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the 
                Nicholas she had known and always slightly feared. He was in a 
                woman's dress, with tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya. 
                She ran rapidly toward him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quite different and yet the same,&quot; thought Nicholas, 
                looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his 
                arms under the cloak that covered her head, embraced her, pressed 
                her to him, and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and 
                had a smell of burnt cork. Sonya kissed him full on the lips, 
                and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya!... Nicholas!&quot;... was all they said. They 
                ran to the barn and then back again, re-entering, he by the front 
                and she by the back porch. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his 
                plans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own 
                advantage. He was merely a man of the world who had got on and 
                to whom getting on had become a habit. Schemes and devices for 
                which he never rightly accounted to himself, but which formed 
                the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves 
                in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. 
                Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, 
                some only beginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, 
                and some in course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, 
                say to himself: &quot;This man now has influence, I must gain 
                his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special 
                grant.&quot; Nor did he say to himself: &quot;Pierre is a rich 
                man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty 
                thousand rubles I need.&quot; But when he came across came across 
                a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this 
                man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasili 
                took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, 
                become intimate with him, and finally make his request.</p>
              <p> 　　He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment 
                as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the 
                status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying 
                him to Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness, 
                yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, 
                Prince Vasili did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. 
                Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been 
                so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse 
                with everybody both above and below him in social standing. Something 
                always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself 
                and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for 
                making use of people.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukhov and a rich 
                man, felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from 
                cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to 
                be by himself. He had to sign papers, to present himself at government 
                offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him, to question 
                his chief steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive 
                many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence 
                but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not 
                to see them. These different people- businessmen, relations, and 
                acquaintances alike- were all disposed to treat the young heir 
                in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently 
                firmly convinced of Pierre's noble qualities. He was always hearing 
                such words as: &quot;With your remarkable kindness,&quot; or, 
                &quot;With your excellent heart,&quot; &quot;You are yourself 
                so honorable Count,&quot; or, &quot;Were he as clever as you,&quot; 
                and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional 
                kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the 
                depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really 
                was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly been 
                spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle 
                and affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist 
                and hair plastered down like a doll's, had come into Pierre's 
                room after the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes 
                she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings 
                and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, 
                except only for permission, after the blow she had received, to 
                remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where 
                she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping 
                at these words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so 
                change, Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without 
                knowing what for. From that day the eldest princess quite changed 
                toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to 
                put up with a great deal from the deceased,&quot; said Prince 
                Vasili to him, handing him a deed to sign for the princess' benefit.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary 
                to throw this bone- a bill for thirty thousand rubles- to the 
                poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share 
                in the affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed 
                and after that the princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters 
                also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the 
                pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused by 
                her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, 
                and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, 
                that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around 
                him. Besides, he had no time to ask himself whether these people 
                were sincere or not. He was always busy and always felt in a state 
                of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the 
                center of some important and general movement; that something 
                was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would 
                grieve and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, 
                all would be well; and he did what was demanded of him, but still 
                that happy result always remained in the future.</p>
              <p> 　　More than anyone else, Prince Vasili took possession of Pierre's 
                affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death 
                of Count Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had 
                the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who 
                yet would not, for pity's sake, leave this helpless youth who, 
                after all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of 
                such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the designs of 
                rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death 
                of Count Bezukhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, 
                and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and 
                assurance, as if he were adding every time: &quot;You know I am 
                overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that 
                I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that 
                what I propose is the only thing possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,&quot; 
                said Prince Vasili one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre's 
                elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long 
                since been agreed upon and could not now be altered. &quot;We 
                start tomorrow and I'm giving you a place in my carriage. I am 
                very glad. All our important business here is now settled, and 
                I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received 
                from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered 
                in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. 
                The diplomatic career now lies open before you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these 
                words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering 
                his career, wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasili 
                interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the 
                possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme 
                cases when special persuasion was needed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy 
                my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has 
                ever complained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you 
                are free, you could throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything 
                for yourself when you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you 
                to get away from these terrible recollections.&quot; Prince Vasili 
                sighed. &quot;Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go in your carriage. 
                Ah! I was nearly forgetting,&quot; he added. &quot;You know, mon 
                cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have 
                received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it; 
                you won't require it. We'll go into the accounts later.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　By &quot;what was due from the Ryazan estate&quot; Prince 
                Vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre's 
                peasants, which the prince had retained for himself.</p>
              <p> 　　In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere 
                of gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or 
                rather the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasili had procured 
                for him, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations 
                were so numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense 
                of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, 
                always in front of him but never attained.</p>
              <p> 　　Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in 
                Petersburg. The Guards had gone to the front; Dolokhov had been 
                reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the 
                provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity 
                to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open 
                his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and 
                whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with dinners and 
                balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasili's house in the company 
                of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the others, Anna Pavlovna Scherer showed Pierre the change 
                of attitude toward him that had taken place in society.</p>
              <p> 　　Formerly in Anna Pavlovna's presence, Pierre had always felt 
                that what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, 
                that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his 
                mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary 
                Hippolyte's stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything 
                Pierre said was charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say so, 
                he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard 
                for his modesty.</p>
              <p> 　　In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one 
                of Anna Pavlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which 
                was added: &quot;You will find the beautiful Helene here, whom 
                it is always delightful to see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time 
                that some link which other people recognized had grown up between 
                himself and Helene, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some 
                obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, 
                and pleased him as an entertaining supposition.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna's &quot;At Home&quot; was like the former one, 
                only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, 
                but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details 
                of the Emperor Alexander's visit to Potsdam, and of how the two 
                august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance 
                to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human 
                race. Anna Pavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, 
                evidently relating to the young man's recent loss by the death 
                of Count Bezukhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to 
                assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the 
                father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like 
                the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august 
                Majesty the Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pierre felt flattered by 
                this. Anna Pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing 
                room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were Prince 
                Vasili and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another 
                group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, 
                but Anna Pavlovna- who was in the excited condition of a commander 
                on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas 
                occur which there is hardly time to put in action- seeing Pierre, 
                touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.&quot; 
                (She glanced at Helene and smiled at her.) &quot;My dear Helene, 
                be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her 
                company for ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here 
                is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre, 
                looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Isn't she exquisite?&quot; she said to Pierre, pointing 
                to the stately beauty as she glided away. &quot;And how she carries 
                herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection 
                of manner! It comes from her heart. Happy the man who wins her! 
                With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant 
                position in society. Don't you think so? I only wanted to know 
                your opinion,&quot; and Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Helene's 
                perfection of manner. If he ever thought of Helene, it was just 
                of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified 
                in society.</p>
              <p> 　　The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, 
                but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined 
                rather to show her fear of Anna Pavlovna. She looked at her niece, 
                as if inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving 
                them, Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre's sleeve, saying: &quot;I 
                hope you won't say that it is dull in my house again,&quot; and 
                she glanced at Helene.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit 
                the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. 
                The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very 
                pleased to see Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same 
                words of welcome and the same look. In the middle of a dull and 
                halting conversation, Helene turned to Pierre with the beautiful 
                bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to 
                that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid 
                no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection 
                of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre's father, Count Bezukhov, 
                and showed them her own box. Princess Helene asked to see the 
                portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is probably the work of Vinesse,&quot; said Pierre, 
                mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table 
                to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said 
                at the other table.</p>
              <p> 　　He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him 
                the snuffbox, passing it across Helene's back. Helene stooped 
                forward to make room, and looked round with a smile. She was, 
                as always at evening parties, wearing a dress such as was then 
                fashionable, cut very low at front and back. Her bust, which had 
                always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that 
                his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm 
                of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only 
                have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was conscious 
                of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking 
                of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty forming 
                a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body 
                only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could 
                not help being aware it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we 
                have once seen through.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?&quot; 
                Helene seemed to say. &quot;You had not noticed that I am a woman? 
                Yes, I am a woman who may belong to anyone- to you too,&quot; 
                said her glance. And at that moment Pierre felt that Helene not 
                only could, but must, be his wife, and that it could not be otherwise.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing 
                at the altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, 
                he did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, 
                he knew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it 
                would happen.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once 
                more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he 
                had seen her every day until then, but he could no longer do it. 
                He could not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft 
                of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can 
                again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be 
                a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him. She already had 
                power over him, and between them there was no longer any barrier 
                except the barrier of his own will.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I will leave you in your little corner,&quot; 
                came Anna Pavlovna's voice, &quot;I see you are all right there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done 
                anything reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to 
                him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna 
                said to him: &quot;I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, 
                and Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg 
                house done up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a good thing, but don't move from Prince Vasili's. 
                It is good to have a friend like the prince,&quot; she said, smiling 
                at Prince Vasili. &quot;I know something about that. Don't I? 
                And you are still so young. You need advice. Don't be angry with 
                me for exercising an old woman's privilege.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She paused, as women always do, expecting something after 
                they have mentioned their age. &quot;If you marry it will be a 
                different thing,&quot; she continued, uniting them both in one 
                glance. Pierre did not look at Helene nor she at him. But she 
                was just as terribly close to him. He muttered something and colored.</p>
              <p> 　　When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking 
                of what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely 
                understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when 
                her beauty was mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: &quot;Yes, 
                she's good looking,&quot; he had understood that this woman might 
                belong to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But she's stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,&quot; 
                he thought. &quot;There is something nasty, something wrong, in 
                the feeling she excites in me. I have been told that her brother 
                Anatole was in love with her and she with him, that there was 
                quite a scandal and that that's why he was sent away. Hippolyte 
                is her brother... Prince Vasili is her father... It's bad....&quot; 
                he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was 
                still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious 
                that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking 
                of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be 
                his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how 
                all he had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again 
                saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasili, but visualized her 
                whole body only veiled by its gray dress. &quot;But no! Why did 
                this thought never occur to me before?&quot; and again he told 
                himself that it was impossible, that there would be something 
                unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage. 
                He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks 
                of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna Pavlovna's 
                words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled 
                thousands of such hints from Prince Vasili and others, and was 
                seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself 
                to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not 
                to do. But at the very time he was expressing this conviction 
                to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all 
                its womanly beauty. </p>

              <p> 　　After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that 
                she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be 
                sure to invite to dinner all who came &quot;to congratulate.&quot; 
                The countess wished to have a tete-a-tete talk with the friend 
                of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, whom she had not 
                seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikhaylovna, 
                with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to 
                that of the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With you I will be quite frank,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna. 
                &quot;There are not many left of us old friends! That's why I 
                so value your friendship.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused. The countess pressed 
                her friend's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vera,&quot; she said to her eldest daughter who was 
                evidently not a favorite, &quot;how is it you have so little tact? 
                Don't you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, 
                or...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at 
                all hurt.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,&quot; 
                she replied as she rose to go to her own room.</p>
              <p> 　　But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples 
                sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. 
                Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses 
                for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were 
                at the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered. Sonya 
                and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.</p>
              <p> 　　It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in 
                love; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling 
                in Vera.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How often have I asked you not to take my things?&quot; 
                she said. &quot;You have a room of your own,&quot; and she took 
                the inkstand from Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In a minute, in a minute,&quot; he said, dipping his 
                pen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You always manage to do things at the wrong time,&quot; 
                continued Vera. &quot;You came rushing into the drawing room so 
                that everyone felt ashamed of you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very 
                reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. 
                She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha 
                and Boris, or between you two? It's all nonsense!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?&quot; said Natasha 
                in defense, speaking very gently.</p>
              <p> 　　She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate 
                to everyone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very silly,&quot; said Vera. &quot;I am ashamed of you. 
                Secrets indeed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All have secrets of their own,&quot; answered Natasha, 
                getting warmer. &quot;We don't interfere with you and Berg.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should think not,&quot; said Vera, &quot;because there 
                can never be anything wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell 
                Mamma how you are behaving with Boris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me,&quot; remarked 
                Boris. &quot;I have nothing to complain of.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really 
                tiresome,&quot; said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled 
                slightly. (She used the word &quot;diplomat,&quot; which was just 
                then much in vogue among the children, in the special sense they 
                attached to it.) &quot;Why does she bother me?&quot; And she added, 
                turning to Vera, &quot;You'll never understand it, because you've 
                never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis 
                and nothing more&quot; (this nickname, bestowed on Vera by Nicholas, 
                was considered very stinging), &quot;and your greatest pleasure 
                is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much 
                as you please,&quot; she finished quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall at any rate not run after a young man before 
                visitors...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now you've done what you wanted,&quot; put in 
                Nicholas- &quot;said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. 
                Let's go to the nursery.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The unpleasant things were said to me,&quot; remarked 
                Vera, &quot;I said none to anyone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!&quot; shouted laughing 
                voices through the door.</p>
              <p> 　　The handsome Vera, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant 
                effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had 
                been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair 
                and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become 
                still colder and calmer. </p>
              <p> 　　In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear,&quot; said the countess, &quot;my life 
                is not all roses either. Don't I know that at the rate we are 
                living our means won't last long? It's all the Club and his easygoing 
                nature. Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, 
                and heaven knows what besides! But don't let's talk about me; 
                tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you, Annette- 
                how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, 
                to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how 
                to deal with them all! It's quite astonishing. How did you get 
                things settled? I couldn't possibly do it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my love,&quot; answered Anna Mikhaylovna, &quot;God 
                grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means 
                and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things 
                then,&quot; she added with a certain pride. &quot;That lawsuit 
                taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I write 
                a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,' 
                and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times- 
                till I get what I want. I don't mind what they think of me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?&quot; asked 
                the countess. &quot;You see yours is already an officer in the 
                Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There's no one 
                to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Prince Vasili. He was so kind. He at once agreed 
                to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,&quot; said 
                Princess Anna Mikhaylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all 
                the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has Prince Vasili aged much?&quot; asked the countess. 
                &quot;I have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyantsovs' 
                theatricals. I expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions 
                in those days,&quot; said the countess, with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is just the same as ever,&quot; replied Anna Mikhaylovna, 
                &quot;overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned 
                his head at all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little 
                for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine 
                fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love 
                for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs 
                are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,&quot; 
                continued Anna Mikhaylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. &quot;My 
                wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would 
                you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don't know how 
                to equip Boris.&quot; She took out her handkerchief and began 
                to cry. &quot;I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble 
                note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril 
                Vladimirovich Bezukhov. If he will not assist his godson- you 
                know he is Bory's godfather- and allow him something for his maintenance, 
                all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able 
                to equip him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin,&quot; said 
                the princess, &quot;that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich 
                Bezukhov so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune... and 
                what is his life worth? It's a burden to him, and Bory's life 
                is only just beginning....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Surely he will leave something to Boris,&quot; said 
                the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are 
                so selfish. Still, I will take Boris and go to see him at once, 
                and I shall speak to him straight out. Let people think what they 
                will of me, it's really all the same to me when my son's fate 
                is at stake.&quot; The princess rose. &quot;It's now two o'clock 
                and you dine at four. There will just be time.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make 
                the most of time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son, 
                and went into the anteroom with him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, my dear,&quot; said she to the countess who 
                saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should 
                not hear, &quot;Wish me good luck.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?&quot; 
                said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, 
                and he added: &quot;If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. 
                He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children. 
                Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see how Taras distinguishes 
                himself today. He says Count Orlov never gave such a dinner as 
                ours will be!&quot;</p>

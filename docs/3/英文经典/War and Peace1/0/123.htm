              <p> 　　After Prince Andrew, Boris came up to ask Natasha for dance, 
                and then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several 
                other young men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her 
                superfluous partners to Sonya, she did not cease dancing all the 
                evening. She noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone 
                else. Not only did she fail to notice that the Emperor talked 
                a long time with the French ambassador, and how particularly gracious 
                he was to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so and So-and-so 
                did and said this and that, and that Helene had great success 
                and was honored was by the special attention of So-and-so, but 
                she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had 
                gone because the ball became livelier after his departure. For 
                one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again 
                her partner. He reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe 
                avenue, and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, 
                and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her. Natasha blushed 
                at that recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if there 
                had been something to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had 
                overheard.</p>
              <p> 　　Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked 
                meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And 
                such was Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, 
                and even her mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved 
                with special care and tenderness, sitting beside her and talking 
                of the simplest and most unimportant matters; he admired her shy 
                grace. In the middle of the cotillion, having completed one of 
                the figures, Natasha, still out of breath, was returning to her 
                seat when another dancer chose her. She was tired and panting 
                and evidently thought of declining, but immediately put her hand 
                gaily on the man's shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm tired; but 
                you see how they keep asking me, and I'm glad of it, I'm happy 
                and I love everybody, and you and I understand it all,&quot; and 
                much, much more was said in her smile. When her partner left her 
                Natasha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If she goes to her cousin first and then to another 
                lady, she will be my wife,&quot; said Prince Andrew to himself 
                quite to his own surprise, as he watched her. She did go first 
                to her cousin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What rubbish sometimes enters one's head!&quot; thought 
                Prince Andrew, &quot;but what is certain is that that girl is 
                so charming, so original, that she won't be dancing here a month 
                before she will be married.... Such as she are rare here,&quot; 
                he thought, as Natasha, readjusting a rose that was slipping on 
                her bodice, settled herself beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat 
                came up to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see 
                them, and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. 
                Natasha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile 
                that said reproachfully: &quot;How can you ask such a question?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have never enjoyed myself so much before!&quot; she 
                said, and Prince Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly 
                as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again. Natasha 
                was happier than she had ever been in her life. She was at that 
                height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and 
                does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by 
                the position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy 
                and absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and 
                standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.</p>
              <p> 　　On her way to supper Natasha passed him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front 
                of him. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance 
                of her own happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How delightful it is, Count!&quot; said she. &quot;Isn't 
                it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what 
                she said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I am very glad,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can people be dissatisfied with anything?&quot; 
                thought Natasha. &quot;Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov!&quot; 
                In Natasha's eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, 
                kind, and splendid people, loving one another; none of them capable 
                of injuring another- and so they ought all to be happy. </p>

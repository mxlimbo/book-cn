              <p> 　　Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to 
                boston with Count Rostov, the general, and the colonel. At the 
                card table he happened to be directly facing Natasha, and was 
                struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball, 
                She was silent, and not only less pretty than at the ball, but 
                only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference 
                to everything around.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's the matter with her?&quot; thought Pierre, glancing 
                at her. She was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, 
                without looking at him, made some reply to Boris who sat down 
                beside her. After playing out a whole suit and to his partner's 
                delight taking five tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the 
                steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking 
                up his tricks, glanced again at Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What has happened to her?&quot; he asked himself with 
                still greater surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to 
                her with a look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, 
                was looking up at him, flushed and evidently trying to master 
                her rapid breathing. And the bright glow of some inner fire that 
                had been suppressed was again alight in her. She was completely 
                transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had 
                been at the ball.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a 
                new and youthful expression in his friend's face.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting 
                now with his back to Natasha and now facing her, but during the 
                whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Something very important is happening between them,&quot; 
                thought Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful 
                agitated him and made him neglect the game.</p>
              <p> 　　After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no 
                use playing like that, and Pierre was released. Natasha on one 
                side was talking with Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle 
                smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to 
                his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat 
                down beside them. Vera, having noticed Prince Andrew's attentions 
                to Natasha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle 
                allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, 
                seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation 
                with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With 
                so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, 
                she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.</p>
              <p> 　　When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vera was being 
                carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew 
                seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you think?&quot; Vera was saying with an arch 
                smile. &quot;You are so discerning, Prince, and understand people's 
                characters so well at a glance. What do you think of Natalie? 
                Could she be constant in her attachments? Could she, like other 
                women&quot; (Vera meant herself), &quot;love a man once for all 
                and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider true love. 
                What do you think, Prince?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know your sister too little,&quot; replied Prince 
                Andrew, with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his 
                embarrassment, &quot;to be able to solve so delicate a question, 
                and then I have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the 
                more constant she is likely to be,&quot; he added, and looked 
                up Pierre who was just approaching them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,&quot; continued 
                Vera- mentioning &quot;our days&quot; as people of limited intelligence 
                are fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised 
                the peculiarities of &quot;our days&quot; and that human characteristics 
                change with the times- &quot;in our days a girl has so much freedom 
                that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling 
                in her. And it must be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.&quot; 
                This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to 
                knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise, but Vera 
                continued with a still more subtle smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think no one has been more courted than she,&quot; 
                she went on, &quot;but till quite lately she never cared seriously 
                for anyone. Now you know, Count,&quot; she said to Pierre, &quot;even 
                our dear cousin Boris, who, between ourselves, was very far gone 
                in the land of tenderness...&quot; (alluding to a map of love 
                much in vogue at that time).</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are friendly with Boris, aren't you?&quot; asked 
                Vera.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I know him...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, there was childish love?&quot; suddenly asked Prince 
                Andrew, blushing unexpectedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to 
                love. Le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage.* Don't you think 
                so?&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, undoubtedly!&quot; said Prince Andrew, and with 
                sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about 
                the need to be very careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, 
                and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre 
                by the arm, and drew him aside.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot; asked Pierre, seeing his friend's strange 
                animation with surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on 
                Natasha as he rose.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I must... I must have a talk with you,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew. &quot;You know that pair of women's gloves?&quot; (He 
                referred to the Masonic gloves given to a newly initiated Brother 
                to present to the woman he loved.) &quot;I... but no, I will talk 
                to you later on,&quot; and with a strange light in his eyes and 
                restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew approached Natasha 
                and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her 
                something and how she flushed as she replied.</p>
              <p> 　　But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting 
                that he should take part in an argument between the general and 
                the colonel on the affairs in Spain.</p>
              <p> 　　Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never 
                left his face. The party was very successful and quite like other 
                parties he had seen. Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle 
                talk, the cards, the general raising his voice at the card table, 
                and the samovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking 
                that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate. 
                They had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute 
                about something important and clever. Now the general had begun 
                such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.</p>

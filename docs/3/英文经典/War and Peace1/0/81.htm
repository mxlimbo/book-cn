              <p> 　　For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his 
                own or at Dolokhov's home: on the third day he received a note 
                from him: </p>
              <p> 　　As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you 
                know of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell 
                supper tonight to my friends- come to the English Hotel. </p>
              <p> 　　About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight 
                from the theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. 
                He was at once shown to the best room, which Dolokhov had taken 
                for that evening. Some twenty men were gathered round a table 
                at which Dolokhov sat between two candles. On the table was a 
                pile of gold and paper money, and he was keeping the bank. Rostov 
                had not seen him since his proposal and Sonya's refusal and felt 
                uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov's clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he entered 
                the door, as though he had long expected him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a long time since we met,&quot; he said. &quot;Thanks 
                for coming. I'll just finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come 
                with his chorus.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I called once or twice at your house,&quot; said Rostov, 
                reddening.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You may punt,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had 
                once had with Dolokhov. &quot;None but fools trust to luck in 
                play,&quot; Dolokhov had then said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Or are you afraid to play with me?&quot; Dolokhov now 
                asked as if guessing Rostov's thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown 
                at the Club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday 
                life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and 
                usually cruel, action.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some 
                joke with which to reply to Dolokhov's words. But before he had 
                thought of anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said 
                slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you remember we had a talk about cards... 'He's a 
                fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,' and I want 
                to try.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To try his luck or the certainty?&quot; Rostov asked 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you'd better not play,&quot; Dolokhov added, and 
                springing a new pack of cards said: &quot;Bank, gentlemen!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down 
                by his side and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing 
                at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why don't you play?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking 
                up a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have no money with me,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll trust you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, 
                and again lost. Dolokhov &quot;killed,&quot; that is, beat, ten 
                cards of Rostov's running.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Dolokhov after he had dealt for 
                some time. &quot;Please place your money on the cards or I may 
                get muddled in the reckoning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts 
                mixed. So I ask you to put the money on your cards,&quot; replied 
                Dolokhov. &quot;Don't stint yourself, we'll settle afterwards,&quot; 
                he added, turning to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.</p>
              <p> 　　All Rostov's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles 
                scored up against him. He wrote &quot;800 rubles&quot; on a card, 
                but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and 
                altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave it,&quot; said Dolokhov, though he did not seem 
                to be even looking at Rostov, &quot;you'll win it back all the 
                sooner. I lose to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid 
                of me?&quot; he asked again.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid 
                down a seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked 
                up from the floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He 
                laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk 
                he had written &quot;800 rubles&quot; in clear upright figures; 
                he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled 
                at Dolokhov's words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a seven 
                to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov's hands which held the pack. Much 
                depended on Rostov's winning or losing on that seven of hearts. 
                On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand 
                rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties 
                had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till 
                May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had 
                replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he 
                gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. 
                Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money, so that 
                this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen 
                hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With 
                a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov's hands and thought, &quot;Now 
                then, make haste and let me have this card and I'll take my cap 
                and drive home to supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and 
                will certainly never touch a card again.&quot; At that moment 
                his home life, jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with 
                Natasha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed 
                in the house on the Povarskaya rose before him with such vividness, 
                clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and 
                unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid 
                chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to 
                the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated 
                and newly illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown 
                and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a 
                sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov's hands. Those broad, reddish 
                hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid 
                down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you are not afraid to play with me?&quot; repeated 
                Dolokhov, and as if about to tell a good story he put down the 
                cards, leaned back in his chair, and began deliberately with a 
                smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going 
                about Moscow that I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come now, deal!&quot; exclaimed Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, those Moscow gossips!&quot; said Dolokhov, and he 
                took up the cards with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Aah!&quot; Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands 
                to his head. The seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first 
                card in the pack. He had lost more than he could pay.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still, don't ruin yourself!&quot; said Dolokhov with 
                a side glance at Rostov as he continued to deal. </p>

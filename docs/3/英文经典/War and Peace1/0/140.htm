              <p> 　　Count Ilya Rostov had resigned the position of Marshal of 
                the Nobility because it involved him in too much expense, but 
                still his affairs did not improve. Natasha and Nicholas often 
                noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately 
                and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral Rostov house 
                and estate near Moscow. It was not necessary to entertain so freely 
                as when the count had been Marshal, and life at Otradnoe was quieter 
                than in former years, but still the enormous house and its lodges 
                were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every 
                day. These were all their own people who had settled down in the 
                house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it 
                seemed, obliged to live in the count's house. Such were Dimmler 
                the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his family, 
                Belova, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many others 
                such as Petya's tutors, the girls' former governess, and other 
                people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to 
                live in the count's house than at home. They had not as many visitors 
                as before, but the old habits of life without which the count 
                and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. 
                There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even 
                enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, 
                the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district 
                on name days; there were still the count's games of whist and 
                boston, at which- spreading out his cards so that everybody could 
                see them- he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every 
                day by his neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to play a 
                rubber with Count Rostov as a most profitable source of income.</p>
              <p> 　　The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not 
                to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so 
                at every step, and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to 
                set to work carefully and patiently to disentangle them. The countess, 
                with her loving heart, felt that her children were being ruined, 
                that it was not the count's fault for he could not help being 
                what he was- that (though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered 
                from the consciousness of his own and his children's ruin, and 
                she tried to find means of remedying the position. From her feminine 
                point of view she could see only one solution, namely, for Nicholas 
                to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope and 
                that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she 
                would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. 
                This match was with Julie Karagina, the daughter of excellent 
                and virtuous parents, a girl the Rostovs had known from childhood, 
                and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of 
                the last of her brothers.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess had written direct to Julie's mother in Moscow 
                suggesting a marriage between their children and had received 
                a favorable answer from her. Karagina had replied that for her 
                part she was agreeable, and everything depend on her daughter's 
                inclination. She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her 
                son that now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was 
                to see him married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully 
                if that were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of 
                a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to 
                go to Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed 
                what his mother's remarks were leading to and during one of these 
                conversations induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him 
                that her only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay 
                in his marrying Julie Karagina.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, 
                would you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for 
                the sake of money?&quot; he asked his mother, not realizing the 
                cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, you have not understood me,&quot; said his mother, 
                not knowing how to justify herself. &quot;You have not understood 
                me, Nikolenka. It is your happiness I wish for,&quot; she added, 
                feeling that she was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled. 
                She began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, don't cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and 
                you know I will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,&quot; 
                said Nicholas. &quot;I would sacrifice anything for you- even 
                my feelings.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But the countess did not want the question put like that: 
                she did not want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished 
                to make a sacrifice for him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, you have not understood me, don't let us talk about 
                it,&quot; she replied, wiping away her tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Maybe I do love a poor girl,&quot; said Nicholas to 
                himself. &quot;Am I to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for 
                money? I wonder how Mamma could speak so to me. Because Sonya 
                is poor I must not love her,&quot; he thought, &quot;must not 
                respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should certainly 
                be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can always 
                sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare,&quot; he said to 
                himself, &quot;but I can't coerce my feelings. If I love Sonya, 
                that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew 
                the conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, 
                and sometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment 
                between her son and the portionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself 
                for it, she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya, 
                often pulling her up without reason, addressing her stiffly as 
                &quot;my dear,&quot; and using the formal &quot;you&quot; instead 
                of the intimate &quot;thou&quot; in speaking to her. The kindhearted 
                countess was the more vexed with Sonya because that poor, dark-eyed 
                niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to her 
                benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and unselfishly 
                in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for finding 
                fault with her.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth 
                letter had come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote 
                that he would have been on his way back to Russia long ago had 
                not his wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate, which 
                obliged him to defer his return till the beginning of the new 
                year. Natasha was still as much in love with her betrothed, found 
                the same comfort in that love, and was still as ready to throw 
                herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at the end 
                of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits 
                of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself: 
                sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to 
                anyone- while she felt herself so capable of loving and being 
                loved.</p>
              <p> 　　Things were not cheerful in the Rostovs' home.</p>

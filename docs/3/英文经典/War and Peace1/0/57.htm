              <p> 　　The day after Rostov had been to see Boris, a review was held 
                of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived 
                from Russia and those who had been campaigning under Kutuzov. 
                The two Emperors, the Russian with his heir the Tsarevich, and 
                the Austrian with the Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty 
                thousand men.</p>
              <p> 　　From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, 
                forming up on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of 
                feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers' command, turned 
                with banners flying, formed up at intervals, and wheeled round 
                other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms; now was 
                heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry 
                in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed 
                bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses; then 
                again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining 
                cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of 
                linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the infantry 
                and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the generals 
                in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn 
                in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, 
                and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, 
                pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and 
                shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, 
                and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every 
                hair of its wetted mane lay smooth- felt that no small matter 
                was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every general 
                and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware 
                of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same 
                time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous 
                whole.</p>
              <p> 　　From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun 
                and by ten o'clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks 
                were drown up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in 
                three lines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and 
                behind that again the infantry.</p>
              <p> 　　A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. 
                The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutuzov's 
                fighting army (with the Pavlograds on the right flank of the front); 
                those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments 
                of the line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the 
                same lines, under one command, and in a like order.</p>
              <p> 　　Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: &quot;They're 
                coming! They're coming!&quot; Alarmed voices were heard, and a 
                stir of final preparation swept over all the troops.</p>
              <p> 　　From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was 
                seen approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, 
                a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the 
                streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against 
                their staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself 
                was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice 
                was heard shouting: &quot;Eyes front!&quot; Then, like the crowing 
                of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from various 
                sides and all became silent.</p>
              <p> 　　In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. 
                This was the Emperors' suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, 
                and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general 
                march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but 
                as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had 
                naturally burst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful 
                kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave 
                the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared &quot;Hurrah!&quot; 
                so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves 
                were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they 
                constituted.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which 
                the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as every 
                other man in that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud 
                consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who 
                was the cause of this triumph.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast 
                mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through 
                fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest 
                heroism, and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still 
                at the imminence of that word.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!&quot; thundered from all sides, 
                one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains 
                of the march, and then &quot;Hurrah!&quot;... Then the general 
                march, and again &quot;Hurrah! Hurrah!&quot; growing ever stronger 
                and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.</p>
              <p> 　　Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and 
                immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came 
                up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole 
                line along which he had already passed. Through the terrible and 
                deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops 
                standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders 
                composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above 
                all freely, and in front of them two men- the Emperors. Upon them 
                the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass 
                of men was concentrated.</p>
              <p> 　　The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the 
                Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, 
                with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted 
                everyone's attention.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen 
                sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he 
                was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish 
                every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced 
                a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. 
                Every trait and every movement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.</p>
              <p> 　　Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something 
                in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and 
                felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed 
                to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible 
                was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment 
                and said a few words to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke 
                to me?&quot; thought Rostov. &quot;I should die of happiness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Tsar addressed the officers also: &quot;I thank you all, 
                gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.&quot; To Rostov every 
                word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have 
                died at once for his Tsar!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have earned the St. George's standards and will 
                be worthy of them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, to die, to die for him &quot; thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear, and 
                the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov too, bending over his saddle, shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; 
                with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself 
                by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as 
                if undecided.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can the Emperor be undecided?&quot; thought Rostov, 
                but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, 
                like everything else the Tsar did.</p>
              <p> 　　That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar's foot, in 
                the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of 
                the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered 
                up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying 
                sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping 
                at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible 
                to Rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski, 
                sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their 
                quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether 
                he ought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski. &quot;Of course 
                not!&quot; he now thought. &quot;Is it worth thinking or speaking 
                of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, 
                and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts 
                matter? I love and forgive everybody now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the 
                troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, 
                recently purchased from Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of 
                his squadron- that is, alone and in full view of the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman, 
                spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot 
                in which the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle 
                to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious 
                of the Emperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his 
                feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the 
                air without touching the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in 
                and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor 
                with a frowning but blissful face &quot;like a vewy devil,&quot; 
                as Denisov expressed it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine fellows, the Pavlograds!&quot; remarked the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap 
                into the fire this instant!&quot; thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and 
                also Kutuzov's, collected in groups and began to talk about the 
                awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, 
                about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially 
                if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.</p>
              <p> 　　But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor 
                Alexander. His every word and movement was described with ecstasy.</p>
              <p> 　　They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible 
                against the enemy under the Emperor's command. Commanded by the 
                Emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it 
                whom it might: so thought Rostov and most of the officers after 
                the review.</p>
              <p> 　　All were then more confident of victory than the winning of 
                two battles would have made them. </p>

              <p> 　　Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition 
                on Denisov's behalf. He could not himself go to the general in 
                attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission 
                to do so, and Boris, even had he wished to, could not have done 
                so on the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries 
                of peace were signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander 
                received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order 
                of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged 
                for the evening, given by a battalion of the French Guards to 
                the Preobrazhensk battalion. The Emperors were to be present at 
                that banquet.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that, 
                when the latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, 
                and early next morning went away, avoiding Boris. In his civilian 
                clothes and a round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at 
                the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where 
                the Russian and French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw 
                tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw 
                the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the 
                streets, with hugh monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses 
                also flags and bunting were displayed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Boris doesn't want to help me and I don't want to ask 
                him. That's settled,&quot; thought Nicholas. &quot;All is over 
                between us, but I won't leave here without having done all I can 
                for Denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the 
                Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!&quot; thought Rostov, who 
                had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged.</p>
              <p> 　　Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite 
                were assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I may see him at any moment,&quot; thought Rostov. &quot;If 
                only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... 
                could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! 
                He would understand on whose side justice lies. He understands 
                everything, knows everything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous 
                than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would 
                it matter?&quot; thought he, looking at an officer who was entering 
                the house the Emperor occupied. &quot;After all, people do go 
                in.... It's all nonsense! I'll go in and hand the letter to the 
                Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskoy who drives me 
                to it!&quot; And suddenly with a determination he himself did 
                not expect, Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went 
                straight to the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I won't miss my opportunity now, as I did after 
                Austerlitz,&quot; he thought, expecting every moment to meet the 
                monarch, and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at 
                the thought. &quot;I will fall at his feet and beseech him. He 
                will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me. 'I am happy 
                when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness,'&quot; 
                Rostov fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who looked 
                after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperor's 
                house.</p>
              <p> 　　A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the 
                right he saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a 
                door leading to the lower floor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whom do you want?&quot; someone inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,&quot; 
                said Nicholas, with a tremor in his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A petition? This way, to the officer the officer on 
                duty&quot; (he was shown the door leading downstairs), &quot;only 
                it won't be accepted.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On hearing this indifferent voice, Rostov grew frightened 
                at what he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any 
                moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he 
                was ready to run away, but the official who had questioned him 
                opened the door, and Rostov entered.</p>
              <p> 　　A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high 
                boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put 
                on, standing in that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the 
                back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces 
                that, for some reason, attracted Rostov's attention. This man 
                was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A good figure and in her first bloom,&quot; he was saying, 
                but on seeing Rostov, he stopped short and frowned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? A petition?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the person in the other room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Another petitioner,&quot; answered the man with the 
                braces.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell him to come later. He'll be coming out directly, 
                we must go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Later... later! Tomorrow. It's too late...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces 
                stopped him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whom have you come from? Who are you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I come from Major Denisov,&quot; answered Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you an officer?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lieutenant Count Rostov.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And 
                go along with you... go,&quot; and he continued to put on the 
                uniform the valet handed him.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch 
                there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform, 
                whom he had to pass.</p>
              <p> 　　Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of 
                finding himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and 
                being put to shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now 
                to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it, Rostov, 
                with downcast eyes, was making his way out of the house through 
                the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand 
                detained him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?&quot; 
                asked a deep voice.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor's special 
                favor during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the 
                division in which Rostov was serving.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the 
                kindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in 
                an excited voice told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede 
                for Denisov, whom the general knew. Having heard Rostov to the 
                end, the general shook his head gravely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining 
                Denisov's case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were 
                heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the 
                porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor's suite ran down the stairs 
                and went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at 
                Austerlitz, led up the Emperor's horse, and the faint creak of 
                a footstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting 
                the danger of being recognized, Rostov went close to the porch, 
                together with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two 
                years, saw those features he adored: that same face and same look 
                and step, and the same union of majesty and mildness.... And the 
                feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in 
                Rostov's soul in all its old force. In the uniform of the Preobrazhensk 
                regiment- white chamois-leather breeches and high boots- and wearing 
                a star Rostov did not know (it was that of the Legion d'honneur), 
                the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his gloves and 
                carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him, 
                brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words 
                to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander 
                of Rostov's division, smiled and beckoned to him.</p>
              <p> 　　All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking 
                for some time to the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward 
                his horse. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street 
                gazers (among whom was Rostov) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping 
                beside his horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned 
                to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing 
                to be heard by all:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is 
                stronger than I,&quot; and he raised his foot to the stirrup.</p>
              <p> 　　The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted 
                and rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, 
                Rostov ran after him with the crowd. </p>

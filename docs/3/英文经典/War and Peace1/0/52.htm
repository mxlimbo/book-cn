              <p> 　　Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince 
                Vasili in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would 
                be paying him a visit. &quot;I am starting on a journey of inspection, 
                and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles 
                to come and see you at the same time, my honored benefactor,&quot; 
                wrote Prince Vasili. &quot;My son Anatole is accompanying me on 
                his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him personally to 
                express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he feels 
                for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, 
                suitors are coming to us of their own accord,&quot; incautiously 
                remarked the little princess on hearing the news.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili's servants came 
                one evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next 
                day.</p>
              <p> 　　Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili's 
                character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul 
                and Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors. 
                And now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the 
                little princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his 
                low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He 
                snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vasili's 
                arrival, Prince Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out 
                of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili 
                was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially 
                annoyed at Prince Vasili's visit, he was in a bad temper, and 
                in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect not to 
                go the prince with his report.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you hear how he's walking?&quot; said Tikhon, drawing 
                the architect's attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps. 
                &quot;Stepping flat on his heels- we know what that means....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　However, at nine o'clock the prince, in his velvet coat with 
                a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed 
                the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince 
                was in the habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the 
                broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left 
                sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides 
                of the path. The prince went through the conservatories, the serfs' 
                quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can a sleigh pass?&quot; he asked his overseer, a venerable 
                man, resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying 
                him back to the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your 
                honor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. &quot;God 
                be thanked,&quot; thought the overseer, &quot;the storm has blown 
                over!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,&quot; 
                he added. &quot;I heard, your honor, that a minister is coming 
                to visit your honor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes 
                on him, frowning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?&quot; 
                he said in his shrill, harsh voice. &quot;The road is not swept 
                for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, there 
                are no ministers!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor, I thought...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You thought!&quot; shouted the prince, his words coming 
                more and more rapidly and indistinctly. &quot;You thought!... 
                Rascals! Blackgaurds!... I'll teach you to think!&quot; and lifting 
                his stick he swung it and would have hit Alpatych, the overseer, 
                had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow. &quot;Thought... 
                Blackguards...&quot; shouted the prince rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　But although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding 
                the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly 
                before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though 
                he continued to shout: &quot;Blackgaurds!... Throw the snow back 
                on the road!&quot; did not lift his stick again but hurried into 
                the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who 
                knew that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne with a radiant face that said: &quot;I know nothing, 
                I am the same as usual,&quot; and Princess Mary pale, frightened, 
                and with downcast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to 
                know that on such occasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, but could not. She thought: &quot;If I seem not to 
                notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem 
                sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) 
                that I'm in the dumps.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fool... or dummy!&quot; he muttered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And the other one is not here. They've been telling 
                tales,&quot; he thought- referring to the little princess who 
                was not in the dining room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is the princess?&quot; he asked. &quot;Hiding?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is not very well,&quot; answered Mademoiselle Bourienne 
                with a bright smile, &quot;so she won't come down. It is natural 
                in her state.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hm! Hm!&quot; muttered the prince, sitting down.</p>
              <p> 　　His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a 
                spot he flung it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman. 
                The little princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering 
                fear of the prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had 
                decided not to appear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am afraid for the baby,&quot; she said to Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne: &quot;Heaven knows what a fright might do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant 
                fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she 
                did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. 
                The prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered 
                by his contempt for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed 
                to life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her 
                room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So we are to have visitors, mon prince?&quot; remarked 
                Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy 
                fingers. &quot;His Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son, 
                I understand?&quot; she said inquiringly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hm!- his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment 
                in the service,&quot; said the prince disdainfully. &quot;Why 
                his son is coming I don't understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth 
                and Princess Mary know. I don't want him.&quot; (He looked at 
                his blushing daughter.) &quot;Are you unwell today? Eh? Afraid 
                of the 'minister' as that idiot Alpatych called him this morning?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, mon pere.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in 
                her choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered 
                about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just 
                opened, and after the soup the prince became more genial.</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little 
                princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, 
                her maid. She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.</p>
              <p> 　　She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. 
                Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn 
                down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,&quot; she said in 
                reply to the prince's question as to how she felt.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you want anything?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, merci, mon pere.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, all right, all right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych 
                stood with bowed head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has the snow been shoveled back?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven's sake... 
                It was only my stupidity.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right,&quot; interrupted the prince, 
                and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for 
                Alpatych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue 
                by coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs 
                up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo 
                before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly 
                fixed his large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life 
                as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason 
                had to provide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish 
                old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this 
                might, he thought, turn out very well and amusingly. &quot;And 
                why not marry her if she really has so much money? That never 
                does any harm,&quot; thought Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which 
                had become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered 
                his father's room with the good-humored and victorious air natural 
                to him. Prince Vasili's two valets were busy dressing him, and 
                he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his 
                son as the latter entered, as if to say: &quot;Yes, that's how 
                I want you to look.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?&quot; 
                Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject of 
                which had often been mentioned during the journey.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful 
                and cautious with the old prince.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he starts a row I'll go away,&quot; said Prince Anatole. 
                &quot;I can't bear those old men! Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Remember, for you everything depends on this.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants' 
                rooms that the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance 
                of both had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting 
                alone in her room, vainly trying to master her agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It 
                can never happen!&quot; she said, looking at herself in the glass. 
                &quot;How shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I 
                can't now be myself with him.&quot; The mere thought of her father's 
                look filled her with terror. The little princess and Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne had already received from Masha, the lady's maid, the 
                necessary report of how handsome the minister's son was, with 
                his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the 
                father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed 
                him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received this 
                information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose 
                chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into 
                Princess Mary's room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know they've come, Marie?&quot; said the little 
                princess, waddling in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.</p>
              <p> 　　She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in 
                the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was 
                carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did 
                not conceal its sunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used 
                to be in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how 
                much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had been added 
                to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toilet which rendered her fresh and 
                prettyface yet more attractive.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?&quot; 
                she began. &quot;They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are 
                in the drawing room and we shall have to go down, and you have 
                not smartened yourself up at all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly 
                and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess 
                Mary should be dressed. Princess Mary's self-esteem was wounded 
                by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still 
                more so by both her companions' not having the least conception 
                that it could be otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed 
                for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, while 
                to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter 
                and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red 
                blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike 
                expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne and Lise. Both these women quite sincerely tried to 
                make her look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could 
                think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect 
                sincerity, and with the naive and firm conviction women have that 
                dress can make a face pretty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,&quot; 
                said Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. 
                &quot;You have a maroon dress, have it fetched. Really! You know 
                the fate of your whole life may be at stake. But this one is too 
                light, it's not becoming!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess 
                Mary that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor 
                the little princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue 
                ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue 
                scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all 
                would be well. They forgot that the frightened face and the figure 
                could not be altered, and that however they might change the setting 
                and adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and 
                plain. After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly 
                submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her 
                head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she 
                had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess 
                walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with 
                her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with 
                her head bent first on one side and then on the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it will not do,&quot; she said decidedly, clasping 
                her hands. &quot;No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. 
                I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress. Now please, do 
                it for my sake. Katie,&quot; she said to the maid, &quot;bring 
                the princess her gray dress, and you'll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                how I shall arrange it,&quot; she added, smiling with a foretaste 
                of artistic pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained 
                sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and 
                saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, 
                ready to burst into sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, dear princess,&quot; said Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                &quot;just one more little effort.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came 
                up to Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming,&quot; 
                she said.</p>
              <p> 　　The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne's, and Katie's, 
                who was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like 
                the chirping of birds.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, leave me alone,&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping 
                of the birds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, 
                large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly 
                and imploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and 
                even cruel to insist.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At least, change your coiffure,&quot; said the little 
                princess. &quot;Didn't I tell you,&quot; she went on, turning 
                reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne, &quot;Mary's is a face 
                which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in the least! 
                Please change it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite 
                the same to me,&quot; answered a voice struggling with tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own 
                to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, 
                worse than usual, but it was too late. She was looking at them 
                with an expression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and 
                sad. This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she 
                never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared 
                on her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will change it, won't you?&quot; said Lise. And 
                as Princess Mary gave no answer, she left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise's 
                request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even 
                look in her glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with 
                downcast eyes and pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant 
                and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried 
                her into a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied 
                a child, her own- such as she had seen the day before in the arms 
                of her nurse's daughter- at her own breast, the husband standing 
                by and gazing tenderly at her and the child. &quot;But no, it 
                is impossible, I am too ugly,&quot; she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,&quot; 
                came the maid's voice at the door.</p>
              <p> 　　She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been 
                thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the 
                icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon 
                of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with folded 
                hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled her soul. Could 
                the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her 
                thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of 
                children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for 
                earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others 
                and even from herself, the stronger it grew. &quot;O God,&quot; 
                she said, &quot;how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations 
                of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, 
                so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?&quot; And scarcely had she 
                put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. 
                &quot;Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious 
                or envious. Man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden from 
                thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it 
                be God's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready 
                to fulfill His will.&quot; With this consoling thought (but yet 
                with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) 
                Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking 
                neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor 
                of what she would say. What could all that matter in comparison 
                with the will of God, without Whose care not a hair of man's head 
                can fall?</p>

              <p> 　　At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more 
                animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had 
                already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself 
                seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander 
                in chief.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?&quot; 
                remarked Shinshin. &quot;He has stopped Austria's cackle and I 
                fear it will be our turn next.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently 
                devoted to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented 
                Shinshin's remark.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is for the reasson, my goot sir,&quot; said he, speaking 
                with a German accent, &quot;for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows 
                zat. He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference 
                ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze 
                Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances...&quot; he spoke 
                this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist 
                of the matter.</p>
              <p> 　　Then with the unerring official memory that characterized 
                him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:</p>
              <p> 　　... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and 
                absolute aim- to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations- 
                has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to 
                create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Zat, my dear sir, is vy...&quot; he concluded, drinking 
                a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* 'Jerome, Jerome, do not 
                roam, but turn spindles at home!'?&quot; said Shinshin, puckering 
                his brows and smiling. &quot;Cela nous convient a merveille.*[2] 
                Suvorov now- he knew what he was about; yet they beat him a plate 
                couture,*[3] and where are we to find Suvorovs now? Je vous demande 
                un peu,&quot;*[4] said he, continually changing from French to 
                Russian. </p>
              <p> 　　*Do you know the proverb?</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] That suits us down to the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　*[3] Hollow.</p>
              <p> 　　*[4] I just ask you that. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!&quot; 
                said the colonel, thumping the table; &quot;and ve must tie for 
                our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it 
                as little as po-o-ossible&quot;... he dwelt particularly on the 
                word possible... &quot;as po-o-ossible,&quot; he ended, again 
                turning to the count. &quot;Zat is how ve old hussars look at 
                it, and zere's an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a 
                young hussar, how do you judge of it?&quot; he added, addressing 
                Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had 
                turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am quite of your opinion,&quot; replied Nicholas, 
                flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses 
                about with as much decision and desperation as though he were 
                at that moment facing some great danger. &quot;I am convinced 
                that we Russians must die or conquer,&quot; he concluded, conscious- 
                as were others- after the words were uttered that his remarks 
                were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore 
                awkward.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What you said just now was splendid!&quot; said his 
                partner Julie.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind 
                them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's fine,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The young man's a real hussar!&quot; shouted the colonel, 
                again thumping the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you making such a noise about over there?&quot; 
                Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other 
                end of the table. &quot;What are you thumping the table for?&quot; 
                she demanded of the hussar, &quot;and why are you exciting yourself? 
                Do you think the French are here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am speaking ze truce,&quot; replied the hussar with 
                a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all about the war,&quot; the count shouted down 
                the table. &quot;You know my son's going, Marya Dmitrievna? My 
                son is going.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret. 
                It is all in God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare 
                you in a battle,&quot; replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, 
                which easily carried the whole length of the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's true!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies' at the 
                one end and the men's at the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You won't ask,&quot; Natasha's little brother was saying; 
                &quot;I know you won't ask!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will,&quot; replied Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. 
                She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, 
                to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma!&quot; rang out the clear contralto notes of her 
                childish voice, audible the whole length of the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the countess, startled; but 
                seeing by her daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook 
                a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement 
                of her head.</p>
              <p> 　　The conversation was hushed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?&quot; and Natasha's 
                voice sounded still more firm and resolute.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess tried to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna 
                shook her fat finger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cossack!&quot; she said threateningly.</p>
              <p> 　　Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked 
                at the elders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You had better take care!&quot; said the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?&quot; Natasha 
                again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank 
                would be taken in good part.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see! I have asked,&quot; whispered Natasha to her 
                little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ice pudding, but you won't get any,&quot; said Marya 
                Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved 
                even Marya Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't 
                like ice cream.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Carrot ices.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?&quot; she 
                almost screamed; &quot;I want to know!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and 
                all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's 
                answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little 
                girl who had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would 
                be pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. 
                The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the 
                guests, leaving their seats, went up to &quot;congratulate&quot; 
                the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with 
                the count, with the children, and with one another. Again the 
                footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in 
                which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned 
                to the drawing room and to the count's study. </p>

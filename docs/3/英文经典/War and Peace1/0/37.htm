              <p> 　　Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under 
                the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly 
                to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness 
                of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike 
                anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five 
                thousand men commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along 
                the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting 
                rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat 
                without losing its heavy equipment. There had been actions at 
                Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and endurance- 
                acknowledged even by the enemy- with which the Russians fought, 
                the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat. 
                Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined 
                Kutuzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov 
                was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The defense 
                of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive, 
                the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern 
                science of strategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was 
                in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable 
                aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces 
                that were advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack 
                had done at Ulm.</p>
              <p> 　　On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed 
                to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the 
                first time with the river between himself and the main body of 
                the French. On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier's division, which 
                was on the left bank, and broke it up. In this action for the 
                first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy 
                generals. For the first time, after a fortnight's retreat, the 
                Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held 
                the field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops were 
                ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, 
                wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded 
                had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter 
                in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; 
                and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted 
                into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick 
                and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over 
                Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout 
                the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous 
                rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, 
                of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of 
                the frightened Bonaparte.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on 
                the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His 
                horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed 
                by a bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief's special favor 
                he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, 
                now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but 
                at Brunn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew 
                could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular 
                men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited 
                but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov, he was 
                sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn. To be so sent 
                meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion.</p>
              <p> 　　The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the 
                snow that had fallen the previous day- the day of the battle. 
                Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly 
                to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, 
                or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief 
                and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in 
                a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length 
                begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he closed 
                his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels 
                and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the 
                Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but 
                he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning 
                afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French 
                had run away. He again recalled all the details of the victory 
                and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured 
                he dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright 
                cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses 
                galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road were forests of 
                different kinds, fields, and villages.</p>
              <p> 　　At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian 
                wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled 
                back in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse 
                abuse. In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, 
                bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road. Some of them 
                were talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread; 
                the more severely wounded looked silently, with the languid interest 
                of sick children, at the envoy hurrying past them.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier 
                in what action they had been wounded. &quot;Day before yesterday, 
                on the Danube,&quot; answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took 
                out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's for them all,&quot; he said to the officer who 
                came up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get well soon, lads!&quot; he continued, turning to 
                the soldiers. &quot;There's plenty to do still.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What news, sir?&quot; asked the officer, evidently anxious 
                to start a conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good news!... Go on!&quot; he shouted to the driver, 
                and they galloped on.</p>
              <p> 　　It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over 
                the paved streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high 
                buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine 
                carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and active town 
                which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite 
                his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove 
                up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had 
                done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his 
                thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and 
                rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, 
                no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form concise form 
                in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis. 
                He vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to 
                him and the answers he would give. He expected to be at once presented 
                to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the palace, however, 
                an official came running out to meet him, and learning that he 
                was a special messenger led him to another entrance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There 
                you will find the adjutant on duty,&quot; said the official. &quot;He 
                will conduct you to the Minister of War.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to 
                wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he 
                returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew 
                before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister 
                of War was at work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared 
                to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of 
                the Russian messenger.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as 
                he approached the door of the minister's room. He felt offended, 
                and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately 
                turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile 
                mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him 
                a right to despise the adjutant and the minister. &quot;Away from 
                the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to gain victories!&quot; 
                he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room 
                of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This 
                feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated 
                at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on 
                them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice 
                of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister's 
                bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the 
                end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the 
                sound of footsteps.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take this and deliver it,&quot; said he to his adjutant, 
                handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special 
                messenger.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov's army 
                interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters 
                he was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special 
                messenger that impression. &quot;But that is a matter of perfect 
                indifference to me,&quot; he thought. The minister drew the remaining 
                papers together, arranged them evenly, and then raised his head. 
                He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he 
                turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his 
                face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. 
                His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even 
                attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is continually 
                receiving many petitioners one after another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?&quot; he asked. 
                &quot;I hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with 
                Mortier? A victory? It was high time!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began 
                to read it with a mournful expression.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!&quot; he exclaimed in German. 
                &quot;What a calamity! What a calamity!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table 
                and looked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? 
                But Mortier is not captured.&quot; Again he pondered. &quot;I 
                am very glad you have brought good news, though Schmidt's death 
                is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majesty will no doubt 
                wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must have a rest. 
                Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let 
                you know.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, 
                reappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably 
                desire to see you,&quot; he added, bowing his head.</p>
              <p> 　　When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest 
                and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in 
                the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. 
                The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle 
                seemed the memory of a remote event long past. </p>

              <p> 　　Count Rostov took the girls to Countess Bezukhova's. There 
                were a good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natasha. 
                Count Rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted 
                almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their 
                conduct. Mademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the drawing 
                room surrounded by young men. There were several Frenchmen present, 
                among them Metivier who from the time Helene reached Moscow had 
                been an intimate in her house. The count decided not to sit down 
                to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as 
                soon as Mademoiselle George's performance was over.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the 
                Rostovs. Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha 
                and followed her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the 
                same feeling she had had at the opera- gratified vanity at his 
                admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration 
                of her beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle 
                George went out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing 
                room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats. 
                Anatole moved a chair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside 
                her, but the count, who never lost sight of her, took the seat 
                himself. Anatole sat down behind her.</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and 
                a red shawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left 
                vacant for her, and assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering 
                was audible.</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience 
                and began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love 
                for her son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she 
                whispered, lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused 
                and uttered hoarse sounds, rolling her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Adorable! divine! delicious!&quot; was heard from every 
                side.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard 
                nor understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt 
                herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless 
                world- so remote from her old world- a world in which it was impossible 
                to know what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind 
                her sat Anatole, and conscious of his proximity she experienced 
                a frightened sense of expectancy.</p>
              <p> 　　After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded 
                Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How beautiful she is!&quot; Natasha remarked to her 
                father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward 
                the actress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't think so when I look at you!&quot; said Anatole, 
                following Natasha. He said this at a moment when she alone could 
                hear him. &quot;You are enchanting... from the moment I saw you 
                I have never ceased...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, come, Natasha!&quot; said the count, as he turned 
                back for his daughter. &quot;How beautiful she is!&quot; Natasha 
                without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at 
                him with surprised inquiring eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, 
                and Countess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.</p>
              <p> 　　The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not 
                to spoil her improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole 
                asked Natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist 
                and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her. 
                During the ecossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole 
                said nothing when they happened to be by themselves, but merely 
                gazed at her. Natasha lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there 
                was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile 
                that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she had to 
                say. She lowered her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't say such things to me. I am betrothed and love 
                another,&quot; she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't speak to me of that! What can I do?&quot; said 
                he. &quot;I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it 
                my fault that you are enchanting?... It's our turn to begin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open 
                frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood 
                hardly anything that went on that evening. They danced the ecossaise 
                and the Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she 
                begged to remain. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking 
                to, she felt his eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she 
                had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange 
                her dress, that Helene had followed her and spoken laughingly 
                of her brother's love, and that she again met Anatole in the little 
                sitting room. Helene had disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole 
                had taken her hand and said in a tender voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I 
                shall never see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?&quot; and, 
                blocking her path, he brought his face close to hers.</p>
              <p> 　　His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers 
                that she saw nothing but them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natalie?&quot; he whispered inquiringly while she felt 
                her hands being painfully pressed. &quot;Natalie?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand. I have nothing to say,&quot; her 
                eyes replied.</p>
              <p> 　　Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant 
                she felt herself released, and Helene's footsteps and the rustle 
                of her dress were heard in the room. Natasha looked round at her, 
                and then, red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry 
                at Anatole and moved toward the door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One word, just one, for God's sake!&quot; cried Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain 
                to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natalie, just a word, only one!&quot; he kept repeating, 
                evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene 
                came up to them.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room. The Rostovs 
                went away without staying for supper.</p>
              <p> 　　After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. She was 
                tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole 
                or Prince Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew- she remembered distinctly 
                how deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that 
                there was no doubt. &quot;Else how could all this have happened?&quot; 
                thought she. &quot;If, after that, I could return his smile when 
                saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to that, it means 
                that I loved him from the first. It means that he is kind, noble, 
                and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to do 
                if I love him and the other one too?&quot; she asked herself, 
                unable to find an answer to these terrible questions.</p>

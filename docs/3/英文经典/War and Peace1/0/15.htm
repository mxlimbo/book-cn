              <p> 　　&quot;My dear Boris,&quot; said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna 
                to her son as Countess Rostova's carriage in which they were seated 
                drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard 
                of Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's house. &quot;My dear Boris,&quot; 
                said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle 
                and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son's arm, &quot;be 
                affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladimirovich is 
                your godfather after all, your future depends on him. Remember 
                that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to 
                be.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would 
                come of it...&quot; answered her son coldly. &quot;But I have 
                promised and will do it for your sake.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at 
                the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without 
                asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch 
                between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly 
                at the lady's old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count 
                or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, 
                said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was 
                not receiving anyone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We may as well go back,&quot; said the son in French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear!&quot; exclaimed his mother imploringly, again 
                laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without 
                taking off his cloak.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My friend,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones, 
                addressing the hall porter, I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is 
                very ill... that's why I have come... I am a relation. I shall 
                not disturb him, my friend... I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich: 
                he is staying here, is he not? Please announce me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, 
                and turned away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich,&quot; 
                he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a 
                swallow-tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the 
                halfway landing.</p>
              <p> 　　The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before 
                a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes 
                briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear,&quot; she said to her son, once more stimulating 
                him by a touch, &quot;you promised me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led 
                to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the 
                hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had 
                sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors 
                turned and Prince Vasili came out- wearing a velvet coat with 
                a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home- taking 
                leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated 
                Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then it is certain?&quot; said the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Prince, humanum est errare,* but...&quot; replied the 
                doctor, swallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with 
                a French accent. </p>
              <p> 　　*To err is human. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, very well...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Seeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son, Prince Vasili dismissed 
                the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a 
                look of inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound 
                sorrow suddenly clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! 
                And how is our dear invalid?&quot; said she, as though unaware 
                of the cold offensive look fixed on her.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and 
                perplexed. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili without acknowledging 
                the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a movement 
                of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it possible?&quot; exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. &quot;Oh, 
                how awful! It is terrible to think.... This is my son,&quot; she 
                added, indicating Boris. &quot;He wanted to thank you himself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris bowed again politely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget 
                what you have done for us.&quot; <br>
                　　&quot;I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna 
                Mikhaylovna,&quot; said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, 
                and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom 
                he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater 
                importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,&quot; added 
                he, addressing Boris with severity. &quot;I am glad.... Are you 
                here on leave?&quot; he went on in his usual tone of indifference.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,&quot; 
                replied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque 
                manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so 
                quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching 
                glance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you living with your mother?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am living at Countess Rostova's,&quot; replied Boris, 
                again adding, &quot;your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina,&quot; 
                said Anna Mikhaylovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know, I know,&quot; answered Prince Vasili in his 
                monotonous voice. &quot;I never could understand how Nataly made 
                up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and 
                stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But a very kind man, Prince,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna 
                with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostov 
                deserved this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the 
                poor old man. &quot;What do the doctors say?&quot; asked the princess 
                after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They give little hope,&quot; replied the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his 
                kindness to me and Boris. He is his godson,&quot; she added, her 
                tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasili much 
                satisfaction.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna 
                saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov's 
                fortune, and hastened to reassure him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion 
                to Uncle,&quot; said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance 
                and unconcern, &quot;I know his character: noble, upright... but 
                you see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... 
                They are still young....&quot; She bent her head and continued 
                in a whisper: &quot;Has he performed his final duty, Prince? How 
                priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, 
                and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. 
                We women, Prince,&quot; and she smiled tenderly, &quot;always 
                know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however 
                painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, 
                as he had done at Anna Pavlovna's, that it would be difficult 
                to get rid of Anna Mikhaylovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear 
                Anna Mikhaylovna?&quot; said he. &quot;Let us wait until evening. 
                The doctors are expecting a crisis.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider 
                that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the 
                duties of a Christian...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, 
                the count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length 
                of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. 
                Prince Vasili turned to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, how is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...&quot; 
                said the princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,&quot; said Anna Mikhaylovna 
                with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. &quot;I 
                have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. 
                I imagine what you have gone through,&quot; and she sympathetically 
                turned up her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left 
                the room at Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying 
                the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting 
                Prince Vasili to take a seat beside her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Boris,&quot; she said to her son with a smile, &quot;I 
                shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had 
                better go to Pierre meanwhile and don't forget to give him the 
                Rostovs' invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won't 
                go?&quot; she continued, turning to the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied the prince, who had plainly 
                become depressed, &quot;I shall be only too glad if you relieve 
                me of that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once 
                asked for him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down 
                one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms. </p>

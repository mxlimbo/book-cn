              <p> 　　One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody 
                in Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an 
                immaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed 
                forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately 
                she could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be 
                more fortunate with you,&quot; he said with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count&quot; 
                (Berg said this with perfect conviction that this information 
                could not but be agreeable), &quot;and so I wish to arrange just 
                a small party for my own and my wife's friends.&quot; (He smiled 
                still more pleasantly.) &quot;I wished to ask the countess and 
                you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Only Countess Helene, considering the society of such people 
                as the Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such 
                an invitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect 
                at his house a small but select company, and why this would give 
                him pleasure, and why though he grudged spending money on cards 
                or anything harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense 
                for the sake of good society- that Pierre could not refuse, and 
                promised to come.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But don't be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about 
                ten minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general 
                is coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. 
                So you will do me the favor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived 
                at the Bergs' house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.</p>
              <p> 　　Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs 
                were really for their guests' arrival.</p>
              <p> 　　In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts 
                and pictures and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely 
                buttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining 
                to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people 
                above one, because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can get to know something, you can ask for something. 
                See how I managed from my first promotion.&quot; (Berg measured 
                his life not by years but by promotions.) &quot;My comrades are 
                still nobodies, while I am only waiting for a vacancy to command 
                a regiment, and have the happiness to be your husband.&quot; (He 
                rose and kissed Vera's hand, and on the way to her straightened 
                out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) &quot;And how have I obtained 
                all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances. It 
                goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, 
                and paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all 
                but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes 
                a man's dignity, what it was ein Mann zu sein.* Vera at the same 
                time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good, conscientious 
                husband, who all the same understood life wrongly, as according 
                to Vera all men did. Berg, judging by his wife, thought all women 
                weak and foolish. Vera, judging only by her husband and generalizing 
                from that observation, supposed that all men, though they understand 
                nothing and are conceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to 
                themselves alone. </p>
              <p> 　　*To be a man. </p>
              <p> 　　Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush 
                her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her 
                straight on the lips.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The only thing is, we mustn't have children too soon,&quot; 
                he continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Vera, &quot;I don't at all want 
                that. We must live for society.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this,&quot; 
                said Berg, pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then Count Bezukhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced 
                at one another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each 
                mentally claiming the honor of this visit.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,&quot; 
                thought Berg. &quot;This is what comes of knowing how to conduct 
                oneself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But please don't interrupt me when I am entertaining 
                the guests,&quot; said Vera, &quot;because I know what interests 
                each of them and what to say to different people.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Berg smiled again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It can't be helped: men must sometimes have masculine 
                conversation,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　They received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where 
                it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its 
                symmetry, neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible 
                and not strange that Berg, having generously offered to disturb 
                the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, 
                but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself, 
                eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection. 
                Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself, and 
                Berg and Vera immediately began their evening party, interrupting 
                each other in their efforts to entertain their guest.</p>
              <p> 　　Vera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to 
                be entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at 
                once began accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation 
                was required, interrupted his wife's remarks and touched on the 
                question of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from 
                the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals 
                made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons 
                why he had declined them. Though the conversation was very incoherent 
                and Vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element, 
                both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only 
                one guest was present, their evening had begun very well and was 
                as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk, 
                tea, and lighted candles.</p>
              <p> 　　Before long Boris, Berg's old comrade, arrived. There was 
                a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg 
                and Vera. After Boris came a lady with the colonel, then the general 
                himself, then the Rostovs, and the party became unquestionably 
                exactly like all other evening parties. Berg and Vera could not 
                repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this 
                movement in their drawing room, at the sound of the disconnected 
                talk, the rustling of dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything 
                was just as everybody always has it, especially so the general, 
                who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the shoulder, and with 
                parental authority superintended the setting out of the table 
                for boston. The general sat down by Count Ilya Rostov, who was 
                next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with 
                the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea 
                table, on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver 
                cake basket as the Panins had at their party. Everything was just 
                as it was everywhere else.</p>

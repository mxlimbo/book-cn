              <p> 　　Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the 
                state of Denisov's affairs, Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter 
                to the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors 
                arrived in Tilsit. Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage 
                on whom he was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed 
                for the stay at Tilsit.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should like to see the great man,&quot; he said, alluding 
                to Napoleon, whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always 
                called Buonaparte.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are speaking of Buonaparte?&quot; asked the general, 
                smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw 
                that he was being tested.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,&quot; 
                he replied. The general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will go far,&quot; he said, and took him to Tilsit 
                with him.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the 
                two Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw 
                Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of 
                the river, saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he 
                sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting 
                Napoleon's arrival, saw both Emperors get into boats, and saw 
                how Napoleon- reaching the raft first- stepped quickly forward 
                to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how they both 
                retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the highest 
                circles Boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that 
                went on around him and to note it down. At the time of the meeting 
                at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon 
                and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to 
                words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors 
                went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget 
                to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had 
                lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that 
                same evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. 
                As the Emperor's suite was a very small one, it was a matter of 
                great importance, for a man who valued his success in the service, 
                to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the 
                two Emperors, and having succeeded in this, Boris felt that henceforth 
                his position was fully assured. He had not only become known, 
                but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him. Twice 
                he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so that the 
                latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from cold-shouldering 
                him as at first when they considered him a newcomer, would now 
                have been surprised had he been absent.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilinski. 
                Zhilinski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately 
                fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, 
                French officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were 
                dining and lunching with him and Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinski 
                arranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was 
                an aide-de-camp of Napoleon's, there were also several French 
                officers of the Guard, and a page of Napoleon's, a young lad of 
                an old aristocratic French family. That same day, Rostov, profiting 
                by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress. came 
                to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, in common with the whole army from which he came, 
                was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon 
                and the French- who from being foes had suddenly become friends- 
                that had taken place at headquarters and in Boris. In the army, 
                Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings 
                of anger, contempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one 
                of Platov's Cossack officers, Rostov had argued that if Napoleon 
                were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign, but 
                as a criminal. Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded French 
                colonel on the road, Rostov had maintained with heat that peace 
                was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal 
                Bonaparte. Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence 
                of French officers in Boris' lodging, dressed in uniforms he had 
                been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from 
                the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French officer, 
                who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of hostility 
                which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly 
                seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether 
                Drubetskoy lived there. Boris, hearing a strange voice in the 
                anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed 
                itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, it's you? Very glad, very glad to see you,&quot; 
                he said, however, coming toward him with a smile. But Rostov had 
                noticed his first impulse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, 
                but I have business,&quot; he said coldly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your 
                regiment. Dans un moment je suis a vous,&quot;* he said, answering 
                someone who called him. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;In a minute I shall be at your disposal.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I see I'm intruding,&quot; Rostov repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris' 
                face: having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very 
                quietly took both Rostov's hands and led him into the next room. 
                His eyes, looking serenely and steadily at Rostov, seemed to be 
                veiled by something, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. 
                So it seemed to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!&quot; 
                said Boris, and he led him into the room where the supper table 
                was laid and introduced him to his guests, explaining that he 
                was not a civilian, but an hussar officer, and an old friend of 
                his.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Zhilinski- le Comte N. N.- le Capitaine S. S.,&quot; 
                said he, naming his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, 
                bowed reluctantly, and remained silent.</p>
              <p> 　　Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person 
                very willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov. Boris 
                did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced 
                and, with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look 
                in his eyes with which he had met Rostov, tried to enliven the 
                conversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic 
                of his countrymen, addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostov, 
                saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the 
                Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I came on business,&quot; replied Rostov, briefly.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the 
                look of dissatisfaction on Boris' face, and as always happens 
                to those in a bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded 
                him with aversion and that he was in everybody's way. He really 
                was in their way, for he alone took no part in the conversation 
                which again became general. The looks the visitors cast on him 
                seemed to say: &quot;And what is he sitting here for?&quot; He 
                rose and went up to Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anyhow, I'm in your way,&quot; he said in a low tone. 
                &quot;Come and talk over my business and I'll go away.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no, not at all,&quot; said Boris. &quot;But if you 
                are tired, come and lie down in my room and have a rest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, really...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They went into the little room where Boris slept. Rostov, 
                without sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Boris were 
                to blame in some way) telling him about Denisov's affair, asking 
                him whether, through his general, he could and would intercede 
                with the Emperor on Denisov's behalf and get Denisov's petition 
                handed in. When he and Boris were alone, Rostov felt for the first 
                time that he could not look Boris in the face without a sense 
                of awkwardness. Boris, with one leg crossed over the other and 
                stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right, 
                listened to Rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate, 
                now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rostov's eyes with 
                the same veiled look. Each time this happened Rostov felt uncomfortable 
                and cast down his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty 
                is very severe in such affairs. I think it would be best not to 
                bring it before the Emperor, but to apply to the commander of 
                the corps.... But in general, I think...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you don't want to do anything? Well then, say so!&quot; 
                Rostov almost shouted, not looking Boris in the face.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment Zhilinski's voice was heard calling Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, go, go, go...&quot; said Rostov, and refusing 
                supper and remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and 
                down for a long time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation 
                from the next room.</p>

              <p> 　　Prince Bagration, having reached the highest point of our 
                right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry 
                was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. 
                The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but 
                the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They 
                began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap 
                was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under 
                the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting 
                blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. 
                Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, 
                groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, 
                while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a 
                bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear 
                rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a steep 
                incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met 
                a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers 
                were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general's 
                presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them 
                rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and 
                an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the 
                crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode 
                up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, 
                drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole 
                air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were 
                blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting 
                powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, 
                while others were firing, though who they were firing at could 
                not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. 
                A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard. 
                &quot;What is this?&quot; thought Prince Andrew approaching the 
                crowd of soldiers. &quot;It can't be an attack, for they are not 
                moving; it can't be a square- for they are not drawn up for that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old 
                man with a pleasant smile- his eyelids drooping more than half 
                over his old eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagration 
                and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported 
                that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and that, 
                though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half 
                his men. He said the attack had been repulsed, employing this 
                military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment, but 
                in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that 
                half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with 
                certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment 
                had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement of 
                the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment 
                and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted &quot;Cavalry!&quot; 
                and our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the 
                cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had 
                come into the hollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagration 
                bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired 
                and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring 
                down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just 
                passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on 
                Prince Bagration's face at this moment. It expressed the concentrated 
                and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot 
                day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The dull, 
                sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of 
                profound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes looked before 
                him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although 
                his movements were still slow and measured.</p>
              <p> 　　The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, 
                entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where 
                they were. &quot;Please, your excellency, for God's sake!&quot; 
                he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite 
                who turned away from him. &quot;There, you see!&quot; and he drew 
                attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually 
                around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that 
                a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: &quot;We 
                are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands.&quot; He 
                spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his half-closed 
                eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff officer 
                joined in the colonel's appeals, but Bagration did not reply; 
                he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give 
                room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, 
                the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by 
                a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by 
                an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving 
                about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily 
                on this French column advancing against them and winding down 
                over the uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers' shaggy 
                caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard 
                flapping against its staff.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They march splendidly,&quot; remarked someone in Bagration's 
                suite.</p>
              <p> 　　The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. 
                The clash would take place on this side of it...</p>
              <p> 　　The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly 
                formed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the 
                laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. 
                Before they had reached Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass 
                of men marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest 
                to Bagration, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced 
                man, with a stupid and happy expression- the same man who had 
                rushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment he was clearly thinking 
                of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed 
                the commander.</p>
              <p> 　　With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped 
                lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching 
                himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease 
                contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping 
                step with him. He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed 
                sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and looked now 
                at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing 
                step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all 
                the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander 
                in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it 
                well he was happy. &quot;Left... left... left...&quot; he seemed 
                to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in time to this, 
                with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with 
                knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of these hundreds 
                of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate 
                step, &quot;Left... left... left...&quot; A fat major skirted 
                a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen 
                behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, 
                panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving 
                the air, flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell 
                into the column to the measure of &quot;Left... left!&quot; &quot;Close 
                up!&quot; came the company commander's voice in jaunty tones. 
                The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the 
                ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned 
                officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his 
                line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and 
                through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating 
                the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well done, lads!&quot; said Prince Bagration.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Glad to do our best, your ex'len-lency!&quot; came a 
                confused shout from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the 
                left turned his eyes on Bagration as he shouted, with an expression 
                that seemed to say: &quot;We know that ourselves!&quot; Another, 
                without looking round, as though fearing to relax, shouted with 
                his mouth wide open and passed on.</p>
              <p> 　　The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and 
                dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed 
                over his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. 
                The head of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared 
                from below the hill.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forward, with God!&quot; said Bagration, in a resolute, 
                sonorous voice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly 
                swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field 
                with the awkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that 
                an invisible power was leading him forward, and experienced great 
                happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside 
                Bagration, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, 
                and even their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer 
                who, with gaitered legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill 
                with difficulty.) Prince Bagration gave no further orders and 
                silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly 
                one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared 
                all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several 
                of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched 
                so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report 
                was heard, Bagration looked round and shouted, &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah- ah!- ah!&quot; rang a long-drawn shout from 
                our ranks, and passing Bagration and racing one another they rushed 
                in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their 
                disordered foe. </p>

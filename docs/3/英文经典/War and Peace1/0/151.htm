              <p> 　　At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with 
                Natasha and Sonya. The countess was still unwell and unable to 
                travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince 
                Andrew was expected in Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be 
                ordered and the estate near Moscow had to be sold, besides which 
                the opportunity of presenting his future daughter-in-law to old 
                Prince Bolkonski while he was in Moscow could not be missed. The 
                Rostovs' Moscow house had not been heated that winter and, as 
                they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with 
                them, the count decided to stay with Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, 
                who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.</p>
              <p> 　　Late one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs drove into Marya 
                Dmitrievna's courtyard in the old Konyusheny street. Marya Dmitrievna 
                lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and her 
                sons were all in the service.</p>
              <p> 　　She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly, 
                loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach 
                to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation- the possibility 
                of which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing 
                a dressing jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and 
                then she drove out: on holy days to church and after the service 
                to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. 
                On ordinary days, after dressing, she received petitioners of 
                various classes, of whom there were always some. Then she had 
                dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were 
                always three or four guests; after dinner she played a game of 
                boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read 
                to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went 
                out to pay visits, and then only to the most important persons 
                in the town.</p>
              <p> 　　She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the 
                pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the 
                Rostovs and their servants. Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles 
                hanging down on her nose and her head flung back, stood in the 
                hall doorway looking with a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. 
                One might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would 
                immediately turn them out, had she not at the same time been giving 
                careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of 
                the visitors and their belongings.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count's things? Bring them here,&quot; she said, 
                pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. &quot;The 
                young ladies'? There to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?&quot; 
                she cried to the maids. &quot;Get the samovar ready!... You've 
                grown plumper and prettier,&quot; she remarked, drawing Natasha 
                (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the hood. 
                &quot;Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!&quot; 
                she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. &quot;You're 
                half frozen, I'm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sonya 
                dear!&quot; she added, turning to Sonya and indicating by this 
                French greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate 
                attitude toward her.</p>
              <p> 　　When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things 
                and tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna 
                kissed them all in due order.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with 
                me. It was high time,&quot; she said, giving Natasha a significant 
                look. &quot;The old man is here and his son's expected any day. 
                You'll have to make his aquaintance. But we'll speak of that later 
                on,&quot; she added, glancing at Sonya with a look that showed 
                she did not want to speak of it in her presence. &quot;Now listen,&quot; 
                she said to the count. &quot;What do you want tomorrow? Whom will 
                you send for? Shinshin?&quot; she crooked one of her fingers. 
                &quot;The sniveling Anna Mikhaylovna? That's two. She's here with 
                her son. The son is getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is 
                here too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping 
                after him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them&quot;- and 
                she pointed to the girls- &quot;tomorrow I'll take them first 
                to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then we'll drive 
                to the Super-Rogue's. I suppose you'll have everything new. Don't 
                judge by me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young 
                Princess Irina Vasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight- 
                looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms. You know not 
                a day passes now without some new fashion.... And what have you 
                to do yourself?&quot; she asked the count sternly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, 
                and now a purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for 
                the house. If you will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down 
                to the estate just for a day, and leave my lassies with you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right. All right. They'll be safe with me, as safe 
                as in Chancery! I'll take them where they must go, scold them 
                a bit, and pet them a bit,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, touching 
                her goddaughter and favorite, Natasha, on the cheek with her large 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the 
                Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, 
                who was so afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her 
                have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her. Marya Dmitrievna 
                ordered almost the whole trousseau. When they got home she turned 
                everybody out of the room except Nataisha, and then called her 
                pet to her armchair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now we'll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. 
                You've hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I've 
                known him since he was so high.&quot; She held her hand a couple 
                of feet from the ground. Natasha blushed happily. &quot;I like 
                him and all his family. Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas 
                much dislikes his son's marrying. The old fellow's crotchety! 
                Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without him, 
                but it's not nice to enter a family against a father's will. One 
                wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You're a clever girl and 
                you'll know how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all 
                will be well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha remained silent, from shyness Marya Dmitrievna supposed, 
                but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched 
                her love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all 
                human affairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew 
                Prince Andrew, he loved her only, and was to come one of these 
                days and take her. She wanted nothing more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see I have known him a long time and am also fond 
                of Mary, your future sister-in-law. 'Husbands' sisters bring up 
                blisters,' but this one wouldn't hurt a fly. She has asked me 
                to bring you two together. Tomorrow you'll go with your father 
                to see her. Be very nice and affectionate to her: you're younger 
                than she. When he comes, he'll find you already know his sister 
                and father and are liked by them. Am I right or not? Won't that 
                be best?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it will,&quot; Natasha answered reluctantly.</p>

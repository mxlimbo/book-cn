              <p> 　　A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostovs that day, 
                as usual on Sundays.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre came early so as to find them alone.</p>
              <p> 　　He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal 
                had he not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that 
                he carried his bulk with evident ease.</p>
              <p> 　　He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His 
                coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that 
                when his master was at the Rostovs' he stayed till midnight. The 
                Rostovs' footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his 
                cloak and take his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always 
                left both hat and stick in the anteroom.</p>
              <p> 　　The first person he saw in the house was Natasha. Even before 
                he saw her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was 
                practicing solfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she 
                had not sung since her illness, and so the sound of her voice 
                surprised and delighted him. He opened the door softly and saw 
                her, in the lilac dress she had worn at church, walking about 
                the room singing. She had her back to him when he opened the door, 
                but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised face, 
                she blushed and came rapidly up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want to try to sing again,&quot; she said, adding 
                as if by way of excuse, &quot;it is, at least, something to do.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's capital!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How glad I am you've come! I am so happy today,&quot; 
                she said, with the old animation Pierre had not seen in her for 
                along time. &quot;You know Nicholas has received a St. George's 
                Cross? I am so proud of him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don't want to 
                interrupt you,&quot; he added, and was about to go to the drawing 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha stopped him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count, is it wrong of me to sing?&quot; she said blushing, 
                and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do 
                you ask me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know myself,&quot; Natasha answered quickly, 
                &quot;but I should not like to do anything you disapproved of. 
                I believe in you completely. You don't know how important you 
                are to me, how much you've done for me....&quot; She spoke rapidly 
                and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. &quot;I saw 
                in that same army order that he, Bolkonski&quot; (she whispered 
                the name hastily), &quot;is in Russia, and in the army again. 
                What do you think?&quot;- she was speaking hurriedly, evidently 
                afraid her strength might fail her- &quot;Will he ever forgive 
                me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do 
                you think? What do you think?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think...&quot; Pierre replied, &quot;that he has nothing 
                to forgive.... If I were in his place...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to 
                the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were 
                not himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask 
                on his knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, 
                and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his 
                lips. But she did not give him time to say them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you... you...&quot; she said, uttering the word 
                you rapturously- &quot;that's a different thing. I know no one 
                kinder, more generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had 
                you not been there then, and now too, I don't know what would 
                have become of me, because...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her 
                music before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking 
                up and down the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then Petya came running in from the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red 
                lips and resembled Natasha. He was preparing to enter the university, 
                but he and his friend Obolenski had lately, in secret, agreed 
                to join the hussars.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this 
                affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted 
                in the hussars.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening 
                to what Petya was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirilych, for heaven's 
                sake! You are my only hope &quot; said Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I'll mention 
                it, I'll bring it all up today.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?&quot; asked 
                the old count. &quot;The countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis' 
                and heard the new prayer. She says it's very fine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I've got it,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;The Emperor 
                is to be here tomorrow... there's to be an Extraordinary Meeting 
                of the nobility, and they are talking of a levy of ten men per 
                thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are again retreating. They say we're already near 
                Smolensk,&quot; replied Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord, O Lord!&quot; exclaimed the count. &quot;Where 
                is the manifesto?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor's appeal? Oh yes!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could 
                not find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand 
                of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, 
                evidently expecting Natasha, who had left off singing but had 
                not yet come into the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On my word, I don't know what I've done with it,&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There he is, always losing everything!&quot; remarked 
                the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of 
                face and sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, 
                Pierre's features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, 
                and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several 
                times.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, really! I'll drive home, I must have left them there. 
                I'll certainly...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you'll be late for dinner.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! And my coachman has gone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Sonya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, 
                had found them in Pierre's hat, where he had carefully tucked 
                them under the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, after dinner,&quot; said the old count, evidently 
                expecting much enjoyment from that reading.</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the 
                new chevalier of St. George, Shinshin told them the town news, 
                of the illness of the old Georgian princess, of Metivier's disappearance 
                from Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to 
                Rostopchin and accused of being a French &quot;spyer&quot; (so 
                Count Rostopchin had told the story), and how Rostopchin let him 
                go and assured the people that he was &quot;not a spire at all, 
                but only an old German ruin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;People are being arrested...&quot; said the count. &quot;I've 
                told the countess she should not speak French so much. It's not 
                the time for it now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And have you heard?&quot; Shinshin asked. &quot;Prince 
                Golitsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian. It is becoming 
                dangerous to speak French in the streets.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? If they call 
                up the militia, you too will have to mount a horse,&quot; remarked 
                the old count, addressing Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, 
                seeming not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, the war,&quot; he said. &quot;No! What sort 
                of warrior should I make? And yet everything is so strange, so 
                strange! I can't make it out. I don't know, I am very far from 
                having military tastes, but in these times no one can answer for 
                himself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy 
                chair and with a serious face asked Sonya, who was considered 
                an excellent reader, to read the appeal. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Moscow, our ancient Capital!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense 
                forces. He comes to despoil our beloved country,&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count 
                listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her 
                father and now at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The 
                countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn 
                expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that 
                the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshin, 
                with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to 
                make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: Sonya's reading, 
                any remark of the count's, or even the manifesto itself should 
                no better pretext present itself.</p>
              <p> 　　After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the 
                hopes the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious 
                nobility, Sonya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the 
                attention that was being paid to her, read the last words: </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people 
                in that Capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation, 
                and for the direction of all our levies, both those now barring 
                the enemy's path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever 
                he may appear. May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on 
                his own head, and may Europe delivered from bondage glorify the 
                name of Russia!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's it!&quot; cried the count, opening his moist 
                eyes and sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been 
                held to his nose; and he added, &quot;Let the Emperor but say 
                the word and we'll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to 
                make on the count's patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place 
                and ran to her father.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a darling our Papa is!&quot; she cried, kissing 
                him, and she again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry 
                that had returned to her with her better spirits.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! Here's a patriot for you!&quot; said Shinshin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not a patriot at all, but simply...&quot; Natasha replied 
                in an injured tone. &quot;Everything seems funny to you, but this 
                isn't at all a joke....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A joke indeed!&quot; put in the count. &quot;Let him 
                but say the word and we'll all go.... We're not Germans!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But did you notice, it says, 'for consultation'?&quot; 
                said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind what it's for....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, 
                came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his 
                breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it's 
                as you please, but I say definitely that you must let me enter 
                the army, because I can't... that's all....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her 
                hands, and turned angrily to her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That comes of your talking!&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　But the count had already recovered from his excitement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, come!&quot; said he. &quot;Here's a fine warrior! 
                No! Nonsense! You must study.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obolenski is younger 
                than I, and he's going too. Besides, all the same I can't study 
                now when...&quot; Petya stopped short, flushed till he perspired, 
                but still got out the words, &quot;when our Fatherland is in danger.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That'll do, that'll do- nonsense....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Petya! Be quiet, I tell you!&quot; cried the count, 
                with a glance at his wife, who had turned pale and was staring 
                fixedly at her son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I tell you- Peter Kirilych here will also tell you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother's milk has hardly 
                dried on your lips and you want to go into the army! There, there, 
                I tell you,&quot; and the count moved to go out of the room, taking 
                the papers, probably to reread them in his study before having 
                a nap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Peter Kirilych, let's go and have a smoke,&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha's unwontedly brilliant 
                eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, 
                had reduced him to this condition.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I think I'll go home.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... 
                You don't often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,&quot; 
                said the count good-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, &quot;only 
                brightens up when you're here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...&quot; 
                said Pierre hurriedly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, au revoir!&quot; said the count, and went 
                out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you going? Why are you upset?&quot; asked Natasha, 
                and she looked challengingly into Pierre's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because I love you!&quot; was what he wanted to say, 
                but he did not say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and 
                lowered his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because it is better for me to come less often... because... 
                No, simply I have business....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why? No, tell me!&quot; Natasha began resolutely and 
                suddenly stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. 
                He tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, 
                and he silently kissed her hand and went out.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostovs' any more.</p>

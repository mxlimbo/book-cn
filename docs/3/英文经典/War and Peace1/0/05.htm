              at Milan?&quot; asked Anna Pavlovna, &quot;and of the comedy of 
              the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur 
              Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting 
              the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's 
              head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.&quot;
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with 
                a sarcastic smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!'* They say 
                he was very fine when he said that,&quot; he remarked, repeating 
                the words in Italian: &quot;'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!'&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware! </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hope this will prove the last drop that will make 
                the glass run over,&quot; Anna Pavlovna continued. &quot;The sovereigns 
                will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,&quot; said 
                the vicomte, polite but hopeless: &quot;The sovereigns, madame... 
                What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame 
                Elizabeth? Nothing!&quot; and he became more animated. &quot;And 
                believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the 
                Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors 
                to compliment the usurper.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some 
                time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward 
                the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing 
                the Conde coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her 
                with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d' azur- maison 
                Conde,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess listened, smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year 
                longer,&quot; the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, 
                in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, 
                does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, 
                &quot;things will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, 
                and executions, French society- I mean good French society- will 
                have been forever destroyed, and then...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre 
                wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, 
                but Anna Pavlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor Alexander,&quot; said she, with the melancholy 
                which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial 
                family, &quot;has declared that he will leave it to the French 
                people themselves to choose their own form of government; and 
                I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will 
                certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,&quot; 
                she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is doubtful,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Monsieur 
                le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone 
                too far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From what I have heard,&quot; said Pierre, blushing 
                and breaking into the conversation, &quot;almost all the aristocracy 
                has already gone over to Bonaparte's side.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the Buonapartists who say that,&quot; replied 
                the vicomte without looking at Pierre. &quot;At the present time 
                it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bonaparte has said so,&quot; remarked Prince Andrew 
                with a sarcastic smile.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming 
                his remarks at him, though without looking at him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow 
                it,'&quot; Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again 
                quoting Napoleon's words. &quot;'I opened my antechambers and 
                they crowded in.' I do not know how far he was justified in saying 
                so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not in the least,&quot; replied the vicomte. &quot;After 
                the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him 
                as a hero. If to some people,&quot; he went on, turning to Anna 
                Pavlovna, &quot;he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc 
                there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their 
                appreciation of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into 
                the conversation, and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would 
                say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The execution of the Duc d'Enghien,&quot; declared Monsieur 
                Pierre, &quot;was a political necessity, and it seems to me that 
                Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself 
                the whole responsibility of that deed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dieu! Mon Dieu!&quot; muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified 
                whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination 
                shows greatness of soul?&quot; said the little princess, smiling 
                and drawing her work nearer to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; exclaimed several voices.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Capital!&quot; said Prince Hippolyte in English, and 
                began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly 
                at his audience over his spectacles and continued.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say so,&quot; he continued desperately, &quot;because 
                the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, 
                and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and 
                so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake 
                of one man's life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Won't you come over to the other table?&quot; suggested 
                Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; cried he, becoming more and more eager, &quot;Napoleon 
                is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed 
                its abuses, preserved all that was good in it- equality of citizenship 
                and freedom of speech and of the press- and only for that reason 
                did he obtain power.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself 
                of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, 
                I should have called him a great man,&quot; remarked the vicomte.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He could not do that. The people only gave him power 
                that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that 
                he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!&quot; continued 
                Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition 
                his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his 
                mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, 
                after that... But won't you come to this other table?&quot; repeated 
                Anna Pavlovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rousseau's Contrat social,&quot; said the vicomte with 
                a tolerant smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,&quot; again 
                interjected an ironical voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what 
                is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation 
                from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas 
                Napoleon has retained in full force.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Liberty and equality,&quot; said the vicomte contemptuously, 
                as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish 
                his words were, &quot;high-sounding words which have long been 
                discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our 
                Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution 
                become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte 
                has destroyed it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre 
                to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first 
                moment of Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social 
                experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's 
                sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced 
                herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces 
                and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,&quot; said she, &quot;how 
                do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc- or even 
                an ordinary man who- is innocent and untried?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should like,&quot; said the vicomte, &quot;to ask 
                how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? 
                It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!&quot; 
                said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's a low fellow, say what you will,&quot; remarked 
                Prince Hippolyte.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and 
                smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When 
                he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously 
                replaced by another- a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, 
                which seemed to ask forgiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly 
                that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. 
                All were silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How do you expect him to answer you all at once?&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew. &quot;Besides, in the actions of a statesman 
                one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as 
                a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, of course!&quot; Pierre chimed in, pleased 
                at the arrival of this reinforcement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One must admit,&quot; continued Prince Andrew, &quot;that 
                Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the 
                hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; 
                but... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness 
                of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it 
                was time to go. </p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone 
                to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat 
                you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte- I must tell it in Russian or the 
                point will be lost....&quot; And Prince Hippolyte began to tell 
                his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending 
                about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly 
                did he demand their attention to his story.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very 
                stingy. She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very 
                big ones. That was her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also 
                big. She said...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas 
                with difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put 
                on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while 
                I make some calls.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long 
                before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the 
                narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna 
                Pavlovna, did however smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl 
                lost her hat and her long hair came down....&quot; Here he could 
                contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: 
                &quot;And the whole world knew....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why 
                he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna 
                Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social 
                tact in so agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable 
                outburst. After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant 
                small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and 
                who would meet whom, and when and where.</p>

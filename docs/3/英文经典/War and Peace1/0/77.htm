              <p> 　　The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white 
                cap on her head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her 
                black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming 
                rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. 
                Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the 
                sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with 
                childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without changing 
                their expression. &quot;I love you all and have done no harm to 
                anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!&quot; her look seemed to 
                say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance 
                of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the 
                sofa and kissed her forehead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My darling!&quot; he said- a word he had never used 
                to her before. &quot;God is merciful....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I expected help from you and I get none, none from you 
                either!&quot; said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having 
                come; she did not realize that he had come. His coming had nothing 
                to do with her sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began 
                again and Mary Bogdanovna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess 
                Mary, again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their 
                talk broke off at every moment. They waited and listened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, dear,&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the 
                room next to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened 
                face and became confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered 
                his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, 
                helpless, animal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got 
                up, went to the door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding 
                it shut.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can't come in! You can't!&quot; said a terrified 
                voice from within.</p>
              <p> 　　He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few 
                more seconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek- it could 
                not be hers, she could not scream like that- came from the bedroom. 
                Prince Andrew ran to the door; the scream ceased and he heard 
                the wail of an infant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have they taken a baby in there for?&quot; thought 
                Prince Andrew in the first second. &quot;A baby? What baby...? 
                Why is there a baby there? Or is the baby born?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that 
                wail; tears choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill 
                be began to cry, sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor 
                with his shirt sleeves tucked up, without a coat, pale and with 
                a trembling jaw, came out of the room. Prince Andrew turned to 
                him, but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without 
                a word. A woman rushed out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating 
                on the threshold. He went into his wife's room. She was lying 
                dead, in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before 
                and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the 
                same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper 
                lip covered with tiny black hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and 
                what have you done to me?&quot;- said her charming, pathetic, 
                dead face.</p>
              <p> 　　In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt 
                and squealed in Mary Bogdanovna's trembling white hands. </p>
              <p> 　　Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into 
                his father's room. The old man already knew everything. He was 
                standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough 
                old arms closed like a vise round his son's neck, and without 
                a word he began to sob like a child. </p>
              <p> 　　Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince 
                Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her 
                the farewell kiss. And there in the coffin was the same face, 
                though with closed eyes. &quot;Ah, what have you done to me?&quot; 
                it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew felt that something 
                gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could 
                neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The old man too 
                came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed 
                one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed 
                to say: &quot;Ah, what have you done to me, and why?&quot; And 
                at the sight the old man turned angrily away. </p>
              <p> 　　Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas 
                Andreevich was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet 
                with her while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy's 
                little red and wrinkled soles and palms.</p>
              <p> 　　His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid 
                of dropping him, carried the infant round the battered tin font 
                and handed him over to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew 
                sat in another room, faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned 
                in the font, and awaited the termination of the ceremony. He looked 
                up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded 
                approval when she told him that the wax with the baby's hair had 
                not sunk in the font but had floated. </p>

              <p> 　　&quot;Dearest,&quot; said the little princess after breakfast 
                on the morning of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip 
                rose from old habit, but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, 
                the sound of every word, and even every footstep in that house 
                since the terrible news had come, so now the smile of the little 
                princess- influenced by the general mood though without knowing 
                its cause- was such as to remind one still more of the general 
                sorrow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dearest, I'm afraid this morning's fruschtique*- as 
                Foka the cook calls it- has disagreed with me.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*Fruhstuck: breakfast. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. 
                Oh, you are very pale!&quot; said Princess Mary in alarm, running 
                with her soft, ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdanovna be sent 
                for?&quot; said one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdanovna 
                was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald 
                Hills for the last fortnight.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes,&quot; assented Princess Mary, &quot;perhaps 
                that's it. I'll go. Courage, my angel.&quot; She kissed Lise and 
                was about to leave the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no, no!&quot; And besides the pallor and the physical 
                suffering on the little princess' face, an expression of childish 
                fear of inevitable pain showed itself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's only indigestion?... Say it's only indigestion, 
                say so, Mary! Say...&quot; And the little princess began to cry 
                capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands 
                even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room 
                to fetch Mary Bogdanovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!&quot; she heard as she left 
                the room.</p>
              <p> 　　The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her 
                small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mary Bogdanovna, I think it's beginning!&quot; said 
                Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess,&quot; said Mary 
                Bogdanovna, not hastening her steps. &quot;You young ladies should 
                not know anything about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?&quot; 
                said the princess. (In accordance with Lise's and Prince Andrew's 
                wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were 
                expecting him at any moment.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No matter, Princess, don't be alarmed,&quot; said Mary 
                Bogdanovna. &quot;We'll manage very well without a doctor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something 
                heavy being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were 
                carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew's study into 
                the bedroom. On their faces was a quiet and solemn look.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds 
                in the house, now and then opening her door when someone passed 
                and watching what was going on in the passage. Some women passing 
                with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess 
                and turned away. She did not venture to ask any questions, and 
                shut the door again, now sitting down in her easy chair, now taking 
                her prayer book, now kneeling before the icon stand. To her surprise 
                and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement. 
                Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Praskovya Savishna, 
                who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden 
                it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've come to sit with you a bit, Masha,&quot; said the 
                nurse, &quot;and here I've brought the prince's wedding candles 
                to light before his saint, my angel,&quot; she said with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, nurse, I'm so glad!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God is merciful, birdie.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down 
                by the door with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began 
                reading. Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look 
                at one another, the princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse 
                encouraging. Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling 
                that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her room. But owing 
                to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the 
                less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not 
                to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid 
                and respectful good manners habitual in the prince's household, 
                a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness 
                that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at 
                that moment made itself felt.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no laughter in the maids' large hall. In the men 
                servants' hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying 
                serfs' quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. 
                The old prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study 
                and sent Tikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what news.- &quot;Say only 
                that 'the prince told me to ask,' and come and tell me her answer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inform the prince that labor has begun,&quot; said Mary 
                Bogdanovna, giving the messenger a significant look.</p>
              <p> 　　Tikhon went and told the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very good!&quot; said the prince closing the door behind 
                him, and Tikhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study 
                after that.</p>
              <p> 　　After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, 
                and, seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed 
                his perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently 
                kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing 
                the candles or saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery 
                in the world continued its course. Evening passed, night came, 
                and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence 
                of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No one slept.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish 
                to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with 
                desperate fury. A relay of horses had been sent up the highroad 
                to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, 
                and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads 
                to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow-covered 
                pools of water.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, 
                her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse's wrinkled face (every line 
                of which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped 
                from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her 
                chin.</p>
              <p> 　　Nurse Savishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, 
                scarcely hearing or understanding her own words, what she had 
                told hundreds of times before: how the late princess had given 
                birth to Princess Mary in Kishenev with only a Moldavian peasant 
                woman to help instead of a midwife.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God is merciful, doctors are never needed,&quot; she 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement 
                of the window, from which the double frame had been removed (by 
                order of the prince, one window frame was removed in each room 
                as soon as the larks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed 
                latch, set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle 
                with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, 
                putting down the stocking she was knitting, went to the window 
                and leaning out tried to catch the open casement. The cold wind 
                flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princess, my dear, there's someone driving up the avenue! 
                &quot; she said, holding the casement and not closing it. &quot;With 
                lanterns. Most likely the doctor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, my God! thank God!&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;I 
                must go and meet him, he does not know Russian.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet 
                the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through 
                the window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. 
                She went out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow 
                candle which guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, 
                the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. 
                Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear 
                the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that 
                seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God!&quot; said the voice. &quot;And Father?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gone to bed,&quot; replied the voice of Demyan the house 
                steward, who was downstairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the voice said something more, Demyan replied, and the 
                steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase 
                more rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's Andrew!&quot; thought Princess Mary. &quot;No it 
                can't be, that would be too extraordinary,&quot; and at the very 
                moment she thought this, the face and figure of Prince Andrew, 
                in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow, appeared 
                on the landing where the footman stood with the candle. Yes, it 
                was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened but 
                agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced 
                his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You did not get my letter?&quot; he asked, and not waiting 
                for a reply- which he would not have received, for the princess 
                was unable to speak- he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs 
                again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him (they 
                had met at the last post station), and again embraced his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a strange fate, Masha darling!&quot; And having 
                taken off his cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princess' 
                apartment.</p>

              <p> 　　Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn 
                and wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, 
                and the new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, 
                though the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur, the dazzling 
                sunshine by day, and the starlight of the winter nights seemed 
                to call for some special celebration of the season.</p>
              <p> 　　On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, 
                all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was 
                the dullest time of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some 
                neighbors that morning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The 
                old count was resting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing room 
                at the round table, copying a design for embroidery. The countess 
                was playing patience. Nastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a 
                sad face at the window with two old ladies. Natasha came into 
                the room, went up to Sonya, glanced at what she was doing, and 
                then went up to her mother and stood without speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you wandering about like an outcast?&quot; asked 
                her mother. &quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!&quot; 
                said Natasha, with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her 
                daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I shall cry directly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sit down with me a little,&quot; said the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, 
                Mamma?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned 
                quickly to hide them and left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, 
                and then went into the maids' room. There an old maidservant was 
                grumbling at a young girl who stood panting, having just run in 
                through the cold from the serfs' quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop playing- there's a time for everything,&quot; said 
                the old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let her alone, Kondratevna,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Go, 
                Mavrushka, go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall 
                and went to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young 
                ones were playing cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can I do with them?&quot; thought Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, 
                go to the yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, 
                bring me some oats.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just a few oats?&quot; said Misha, cheerfully and readily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, go quickly,&quot; the old man urged him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a 
                samovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.</p>
              <p> 　　Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the 
                house. Natasha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted 
                the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh dear, what a young lady!&quot; said Foka, pretending 
                to frown at Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much 
                trouble as Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, 
                but had to send them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether 
                any of them would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled 
                no one's orders so readily as they did hers. &quot;What can I 
                do, where can I go?&quot; thought she, as she went slowly along 
                the passage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?&quot; 
                she asked the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's 
                jacket.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,&quot; answered the 
                buffoon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, where am I 
                to go? What am I to do with myself?&quot; And tapping with her 
                heels, she ran quickly upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who 
                lived on the upper story.</p>
              <p> 　　Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on 
                which were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses 
                were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. 
                Natasha sat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful 
                air, and then got up again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The island of Madagascar,&quot; she said, &quot;Ma-da-gas-car,&quot; 
                she repeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not 
                replying to Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she 
                went out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Her brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance 
                on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Petya! Petya!&quot; she called to him. &quot;Carry me 
                downstairs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting 
                her arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, don't... the island of Madagascar!&quot; she said, 
                and jumping off his back she went downstairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, 
                and made sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same 
                it was dull, Natasha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up 
                her guitar, sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began 
                to run her fingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a 
                passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg 
                with Prince Andrew. What she drew from the guitar would have had 
                no meaning for other listeners, but in her imagination a whole 
                series of reminiscences arose from those sounds. She sat behind 
                the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping 
                from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She 
                was in a mood for brooding on the past.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha 
                glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed 
                to her that she remembered the light failing through that crack 
                once before and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand. &quot;Yes 
                it was exactly the same,&quot; thought Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, what is this?&quot; she cried, twanging a thick 
                string.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you are there!&quot; said Sonya with a start, and 
                came near and listened. &quot;I don't know. A storm?&quot; she 
                ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! That's just how she started and just how she 
                came up smiling timidly when all this happened before,&quot; thought 
                Natasha, &quot;and in just the same way I thought there was something 
                lacking in her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen! 
                &quot; and Natasha sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should 
                catch it. &quot;Where were you going?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing 
                the design.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You always find something to do, but I can't,&quot; 
                said Natasha. &quot;And where's Nicholas?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Asleep, I think.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sonya, go and wake him,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Tell 
                him I want him to come and sing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having 
                happened before could be, and without solving this problem, or 
                at all regretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy 
                to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with 
                a lover's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it 
                will never be! And, worst of all, I am growing old- that's the 
                thing! There won't then be in me what there is now. But perhaps 
                he'll come today, will come immediately. Perhaps he has come and 
                is sitting in the drawing room. Perhaps he came yesterday and 
                I have forgotten it.&quot; She rose, put down the guitar, and 
                went to the drawing room.</p>
              <p> 　　All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, 
                were already at the tea table. The servants stood round the table- 
                but Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, here she is!&quot; said the old count, when he saw 
                Natasha enter. &quot;Well, sit down by me.&quot; But Natasha stayed 
                by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma!&quot; she muttered, &quot;give him to me, give 
                him, Mamma, quickly, quickly!&quot; and she again had difficulty 
                in repressing her sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation 
                between the elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. 
                &quot;My God, my God! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding 
                his cup and blowing in the same way!&quot; thought Natasha, feeling 
                with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole 
                household, because they were always the same.</p>
              <p> 　　After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting 
                room, to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks 
                always began.</p>

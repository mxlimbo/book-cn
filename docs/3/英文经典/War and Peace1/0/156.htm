              <p> 　　Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had 
                sent him away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty 
                thousand rubles a year in cash, besides running up debts for as 
                much more, which his creditors demanded from his father.</p>
              <p> 　　His father announced to him that he would now pay half his 
                debts for the last time, but only on condition that he went to 
                Moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief- a post his father 
                had procured for him- and would at last try to make a good match 
                there. He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Karagina.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre's 
                house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used 
                to him after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, 
                and gave him money under the guise of loans.</p>
              <p> 　　As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole 
                had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact 
                that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and 
                French actresses- with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, 
                he was said to be on intimate relations. He had never missed a 
                carousal at Danilov's or other Moscow revelers', drank whole nights 
                through, outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and 
                parties of the best society. There was talk of his intrigues with 
                some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. 
                But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the rich 
                heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason 
                for this, as he had got married two years before- a fact known 
                only to his most intimate friends. At that time while with his 
                regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced 
                him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his 
                wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law, 
                had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, 
                and with others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced 
                that was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and 
                that he had never in his life done anything base. He was incapable 
                of considering how his actions might affect others or what the 
                consequences of this or that action of his might be. He was convinced 
                that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so God 
                had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a 
                year and always occupy a prominent position in society. He believed 
                this so firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of 
                it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society 
                or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently 
                would not repay.</p>
              <p> 　　He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. 
                He was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still 
                less could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed 
                his father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions 
                of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked 
                of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women, and as according 
                to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and 
                he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his 
                tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered himself irreproachable, 
                sincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with a tranquil 
                conscience carried his head high.</p>
              <p> 　　Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence 
                similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same 
                hope of forgiveness. &quot;All will be forgiven her, for she loved 
                much; and all will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his 
                exile and his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, 
                gambling, and dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg 
                comrade Kuragin and made use of him for his own ends.</p>
              <p> 　　Anatole was sincerely fond of Dolokhov for his cleverness 
                and audacity. Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin's name, position, 
                and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling 
                set, made use of him and amused himself at his expense without 
                letting the other feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived 
                from Anatole, the very process of dominating another's will was 
                in itself a pleasure, a habit, and a necessity to Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. At supper 
                after the opera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur 
                the attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed 
                his intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and 
                was incapable of considering what might come of such love-making, 
                as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,&quot; 
                replied Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,&quot; said 
                Anatole. &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You'd better wait till she's married....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads 
                at once,&quot; pursued Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have been caught once already by a 'little girl,'&quot; 
                said Dolokhov who knew of Kuragin's marriage. &quot;Take care!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?&quot; said Anatole, 
                with a good-humored laugh. </p>

              <p> 　　The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, 
                a battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and 
                a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the 
                left.</p>
              <p> 　　As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which 
                presented arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite 
                flank, and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon. It 
                could be no one else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, 
                a blue uniform open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon 
                over his shoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray 
                Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On approaching 
                Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, Rostov, with his 
                cavalryman's eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not 
                sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; 
                and &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; Napoleon said something to Alexander, 
                and both Emperors dismounted and took each other's hands. Napoleon's 
                face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying 
                something affable to him.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes' horses, 
                which were pushing back the crowd, Rostov kept his eyes on every 
                movement of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise 
                that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter 
                was quite at ease with the Tsar, as if such relations with an 
                Emperor were an everyday matter to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, 
                approached the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and 
                came straight up to the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly 
                found itself so close to the Emperors that Rostov, standing in 
                the front row, was afraid he might be recognized.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of 
                Honor to the bravest of your soldiers,&quot; said a sharp, precise 
                voice, articulating every letter.</p>
              <p> 　　This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight 
                into Alexander's eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what 
                was said to him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last 
                war,&quot; added Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with 
                a composure and assurance exasperating to Rostov, he ran his eyes 
                over the Russian ranks drawn up before him, who all presented 
                arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?&quot; 
                said Alexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski, 
                the commander of the battalion.</p>
              <p> 　　Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white 
                hand, tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp 
                behind him rushed forward and picked it up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To whom shall it be given?&quot; the Emperor Alexander 
                asked Koslovski, in Russian in a low voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To whomever Your Majesty commands.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing 
                back, remarked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But we must give him an answer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov 
                in his scrutiny.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can it be me?&quot; thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lazarev!&quot; the colonel called, with a frown, and 
                Lazarev, the first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you off to? Stop here!&quot; voices whispered 
                to Lazarev who did not know where to go. Lazarev stopped, casting 
                a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as 
                often happens to soldiers called before the ranks.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little 
                hand out behind him as if to take something. The members of his 
                suite, guessing at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered 
                as they passed something from one to another, and a page- the 
                same one Rostov had seen the previous evening at Boris'- ran forward 
                and, bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping 
                it waiting a moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, 
                without looking, pressed two fingers together and the badge was 
                between them. Then he approached Lazarev (who rolled his eyes 
                and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the 
                Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done 
                for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the 
                Order touched one of Lazarev's buttons. It was as if Napoleon 
                knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch 
                that soldier's breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, 
                and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely 
                laid the cross on Lazarev's breast and, dropping his hand, turned 
                toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. 
                And it really did.</p>
              <p> 　　Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the 
                cross and fastened it to the uniform. Lazarev glanced morosely 
                at the little man with white hands who was doing something to 
                him and, still standing motionless presenting arms, looked again 
                straight into Alexander's eyes, as if asking whether he should 
                stand there, or go away, or do something else. But receiving no 
                orders, he remained for some time in that rigid position.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhensk battalion, 
                breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at 
                the tables prepared for them.</p>
              <p> 　　Lazarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers 
                embraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds 
                of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble 
                of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round 
                the tables in the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking 
                cheerful and happy, passed by Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What d'you think of the treat? All on silver plate,&quot; 
                one of them was saying. &quot;Have you seen Lazarev?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhenskis will give them 
                a dinner.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but what luck for Lazarev! Twelve hundred francs' 
                pension for life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here's a cap, lads!&quot; shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier, 
                donning a shaggy French cap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a fine thing! First-rate!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you heard the password?&quot; asked one Guards' 
                officer of another. &quot;The day before yesterday it was 'Napoleon, 
                France, bravoure'; yesterday, 'Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.' One 
                day our Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor 
                will send a St. George's Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. 
                It has to be done. He must respond in kind.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris, too, with his friend Zhilinski, came to see the Preobrazhensk 
                banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostov standing by the corner 
                of a house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rostov! How d'you do? We missed one another,&quot; he 
                said, and could not refrain from asking what was the matter, so 
                strangely dismal and troubled was Rostov's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; replied Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You'll call round?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I will.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov stood at that corner for a long time, watching the 
                feast from a distance. a distance. In his mind, a painful process 
                was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion. Terrible 
                doubts rose in his soul. Now he remembered Denisov with his changed 
                expression, his submission, and the whole hospital, with arms 
                and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So vividly did he 
                recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round 
                to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that self-satisfied 
                Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, 
                liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed arms 
                and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of Lazarev 
                rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself 
                harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.</p>
              <p> 　　The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and 
                a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had 
                to get something to eat before going away. He went to a hotel 
                he had noticed that morning. There he found so many people, among 
                them officers who, like himself, had come in civilian clothes, 
                that he had difficulty in getting a dinner. Two officers of his 
                own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on 
                the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, 
                were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of 
                Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon 
                would have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions 
                nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in 
                silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself. The 
                process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a 
                conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not 
                get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers' saying that 
                it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began shouting 
                with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of 
                the officers:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can you judge what's best?&quot; he cried, the blood 
                suddenly rushing to his face. &quot;How can you judge the Emperor's 
                actions? What right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either 
                the Emperor's or his actions!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I never said a word about the Emperor!&quot; said 
                the officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand Rostov's 
                outburst, except on the supposition that he was drunk.</p>
              <p> 　　But Rostov did not listen to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and 
                nothing more,&quot; he went on. &quot;If we are ordered to die, 
                we must die. If we're punished, it means that we have deserved 
                it, it's not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize 
                Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it 
                means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging 
                and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That 
                way we shall be saying there is no God- nothing!&quot; shouted 
                Nicholas, banging the table- very little to the point as it seemed 
                to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own 
                thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to 
                think! That's all....&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And to drink,&quot; said one of the officers, not wishing 
                to quarrel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and to drink,&quot; assented Nicholas. &quot;Hullo 
                there! Another bottle!&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview 
                with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg 
                there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.

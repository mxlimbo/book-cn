              <p> 　　While these conversations were going on in the reception room 
                and the princess' room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had 
                been sent for) and Anna Mikhaylovna (who found it necessary to 
                accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezukhov's 
                house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the 
                windows, Anna Mikhaylovna, having turned with words of comfort 
                to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and 
                woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikhaylovna 
                out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview 
                with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they 
                had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While 
                he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked 
                like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in 
                the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several 
                other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on 
                both sides. But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the 
                coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice 
                of them. &quot;It seems to be all right,&quot; Pierre concluded, 
                and followed Anna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow 
                dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging 
                behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary 
                for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go 
                by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikhaylovna's air of assurance 
                and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. 
                Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men 
                who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. 
                These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna 
                pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?&quot; 
                asked Anna Mikhaylovna of one of them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as 
                if anything were now permissible; &quot;the door to the left, 
                ma'am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps the count did not ask for me,&quot; said Pierre 
                when he reached the landing. &quot;I'd better go to my own room.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my friend!&quot; she said, touching his arm as she 
                had done her son's when speaking to him that afternoon, &quot;believe 
                me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But really, hadn't I better go away?&quot; he asked, 
                looking kindly at her over his spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have 
                been done you. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the 
                agony of death.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I have loved you like 
                a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not 
                forget your interests.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that 
                all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna 
                Mikhaylovna who was already opening a door.</p>
              <p> 　　This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant 
                of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre 
                had never been in this part of the house and did not even know 
                of the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing 
                a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as &quot;my 
                dear&quot; and &quot;my sweet,&quot; asked about the princess' 
                health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door 
                on the left led into the princesses' apartments. The maid with 
                the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything 
                in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna 
                Mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where 
                Prince Vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together 
                talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasili drew back with obvious 
                impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of 
                desperation slammed the door with all her might.</p>
              <p> 　　This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear 
                depicted on Prince Vasili's face so out of keeping with his dignity 
                that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles 
                at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled 
                faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she 
                had expected.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,&quot; 
                said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the 
                passage.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still 
                less what &quot;watching over his interests&quot; meant, but he 
                decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they 
                went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count's reception 
                room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known 
                to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room 
                there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the 
                carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant 
                who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into 
                the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows 
                opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length 
                portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting 
                here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one 
                another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn 
                Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of 
                Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the 
                decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg 
                lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room 
                even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought 
                with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission 
                was assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and 
                noticing the count's confessor there, she glided up to him with 
                a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly 
                smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and 
                then of another priest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God be thanked that you are in time,&quot; said she 
                to one of the priests; &quot;all we relatives have been in such 
                anxiety. This young man is the count's son,&quot; she added more 
                softly. &quot;What a terrible moment!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having said this she went up to the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear doctor,&quot; said she, &quot;this young man is 
                the count's son. Is there any hope?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged 
                his shoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised 
                her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and 
                moved away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly 
                respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Trust in His mercy!&quot; and pointing out a small sofa 
                for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the 
                door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as 
                she disappeared behind it.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, 
                moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna 
                had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned 
                to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed 
                that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks 
                at him with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such 
                as he had never before received was shown him. A strange lady, 
                the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered 
                him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre 
                had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed 
                by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take 
                another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up 
                the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even 
                in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and 
                that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful 
                rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore 
                bound to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from 
                the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady's chair, placing his 
                huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of 
                an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as 
                it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish 
                things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield 
                himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.</p>
              <p> 　　Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head 
                erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat 
                with three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner 
                since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced 
                round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a 
                thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing 
                to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. 
                That is well!&quot; and he turned to go.</p>
              <p> 　　But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: &quot;How is...&quot; 
                and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call 
                the dying man &quot;the count,&quot; yet ashamed to call him &quot;father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, 
                my friend...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's mind was in such a confused state that the word &quot;stroke&quot; 
                suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasili 
                in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack 
                of illness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing 
                and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on 
                tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess 
                followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also 
                went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of things 
                being moved about, and at last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the 
                same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran 
                out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about 
                to be administered. Come.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and 
                noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the 
                servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further 
                need for permission to enter that room. </p>

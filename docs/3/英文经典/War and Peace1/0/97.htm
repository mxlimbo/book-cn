              <p> 　　It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up 
                to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached 
                the house, Prince Andrew with asmile drew Pierre's attention to 
                a commotion going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, 
                with a wallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man 
                in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage 
                driving up. Two women ran out after them, and all four, looking 
                round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back 
                porch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Those are Mary's 'God's folk,'&quot; said Prince Andrew. 
                &quot;They have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter 
                in which she disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven 
                away, but she receives them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what are 'God's folk'?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out 
                to meet them, and he asked where the old prince was and whether 
                he was expected back soon.</p>
              <p> 　　The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back 
                any minute.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were 
                always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father's 
                house; he himself went to the nursery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us go and see my sister,&quot; he said to Pierre 
                when he returned. &quot;I have not found her yet, she is hiding 
                now, sitting with her 'God's folk.' It will serve her right, she 
                will be confused, but you will see her 'God's folk.' It's really 
                very curious.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are 'God's folk'?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, and you'll see for yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came 
                on her face when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning 
                before the icon stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, 
                wearing a monk's cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a 
                samovar. Near them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old 
                woman, with a meek expression on her childlike face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, why didn't you warn me?&quot; said the princess, 
                with mild reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen 
                before her chickens.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Charmee de vous voir. Je suis tres contente de vous 
                voir,&quot;* she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had 
                known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrew, his 
                misfortune with his wife, and above all his kindly, simple face 
                disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him with her 
                beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, &quot;I like you very 
                much, but please don't laugh at my people.&quot; After exchanging 
                the first greetings, they sat down. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, and Ivanushka is here too!&quot; said Prince Andrew, 
                glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew!&quot; said Princess Mary, imploringly. &quot;Il 
                faut que vous sachiez que c'est une femme,&quot;* said Prince 
                Andrew to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, au nom de Dieu!&quot;*[2] Princess Mary repeated. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;You must know that this is a woman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;For heaven's sake.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that Prince Andrew's ironical tone toward the 
                pilgrims and Princess Mary's helpless attempts to protect them 
                were their customary long-established relations on the matter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mais, ma bonne amie,&quot; said Prince Andrew, &quot;vous 
                devriez au contraire m'etre reconnaissante de ce que j'explique 
                a Pierre votre intimite avec ce jeune homme.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful 
                to me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really?&quot; said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles 
                with curiosity and seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially 
                grateful to him) into Ivanushka's face, who, seeing that she was 
                being spoken about, looked round at them all with crafty eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary's embarrassment on her people's account was 
                quite unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old 
                woman, lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, 
                had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar 
                beside it, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be 
                offered another cup of tea. Ivanushka, sipping out of her saucer, 
                looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young 
                men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where have you been? To Kiev?&quot; Prince Andrew asked 
                the old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have, good sir,&quot; she answered garrulously. &quot;Just 
                at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and 
                heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I'm from 
                Kolyazin, master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been 
                revealed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And was Ivanushka with you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I go by myself, benefactor,&quot; said Ivanushka, trying 
                to speak in a bass voice. &quot;I only came across Pelageya in 
                Yukhnovo...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pelageya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to 
                tell what she had seen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In Kolyazin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it? Some new relics?&quot; asked Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, do leave off,&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;Don't 
                tell him, Pelageya.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No... why not, my dear, why shouldn't I? I like him. 
                He is kind, he is one of God's chosen, he's a benefactor, he once 
                gave me ten rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril 
                says to me (he's one of God's own and goes barefoot summer and 
                winter), he says, 'Why are you not going to the right place? Go 
                to Kolyazin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of 
                God has been revealed.' On hearing those words I said good-by 
                to the holy folk and went.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured 
                tones, drawing in her breath.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So I come, master, and the people say to me: 'A great 
                blessing has been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks 
                of our blessed Mother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God'....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,&quot; 
                said Princess Mary, flushing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me ask her,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Did you see 
                it yourselves?&quot; he inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness 
                on the face like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother's 
                cheek it drops and drops....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, dear me, that must be a fraud!&quot; said Pierre, 
                naively, who had listened attentively to the pilgrim.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, master, what are you saying?&quot; exclaimed the 
                horrified Pelageya, turning to Princess Mary for support.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They impose on the people,&quot; he repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; exclaimed the pilgrim woman, 
                crossing herself. &quot;Oh, don't speak so, master! There was 
                a general who did not believe, and said, 'The monks cheat,' and 
                as soon as he'd said it he went blind. And he dreamed that the 
                Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said, 
                'Believe in me and I will make you whole.' So he begged: 'Take 
                me to her, take me to her.' It's the real truth I'm telling you, 
                I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, 
                and he goes up to her and falls down and says, 'Make me whole,' 
                says he, 'and I'll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.' I 
                saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the icon. Well, 
                and what do you think? He received his sight! It's a sin to speak 
                so. God will punish you,&quot; she said admonishingly, turning 
                to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How did the star get into the icon?&quot; Pierre asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew, with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!&quot; 
                she began, her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. &quot;Master, 
                what have you said? God forgive you!&quot; And she crossed herself. 
                &quot;Lord forgive him! My dear, what does it mean?...&quot; she 
                asked, turning to Princess Mary. She got up and, almost crying, 
                began to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt frightened and 
                ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things 
                could be said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo 
                the charity of this house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, why need you do it?&quot; said Princess Mary. &quot;Why 
                did you come to me?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, Pelageya, I was joking,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Princesse, 
                ma parole, je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser.* I did not mean anything, 
                I was only joking,&quot; he said, smiling shyly and trying to 
                efface his offense. &quot;It was all my fault, and Andrew was 
                only joking.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Pelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's face there was 
                such a look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so 
                meekly now at her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.

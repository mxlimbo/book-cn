              <p> 　　At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and 
                alert eyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his 
                shoulder, entered the room, stepping briskly to the front of the 
                crowd of gentry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,&quot; 
                said Rostopchin. &quot;I am straight from the palace. Seeing the 
                position we are in, I think there is little need for discussion. 
                The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants. Millions 
                will pour forth from there&quot;- he pointed to the merchants' 
                hall- &quot;but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves... 
                That is the least we can do!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at 
                the table. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After 
                all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one 
                after another, &quot;I agree,&quot; or for variety, &quot;I too 
                am of that opinion,&quot; and so on had even a mournful effect.</p>
              <p> 　　The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the 
                Moscow nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully 
                equipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolensk gentry 
                had done. Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen 
                who had conferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking 
                up and down, arm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in 
                couples.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor! The Emperor!&quot; a sudden cry resounded 
                through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between 
                two lines of nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck 
                curiosity. Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all 
                that the Emperor said. From what he did hear he understood that 
                the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of 
                the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by 
                a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen!&quot; said the Emperor with a quivering voice.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, 
                so that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of 
                the Emperor saying with emotion:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, 
                but today it has surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the 
                name of the Fatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round 
                him, and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, most precious... a royal word,&quot; said Count 
                Rostov, with a sob. He stood at the back, and, though he had heard 
                hardly anything, understood everything in his own way.</p>
              <p> 　　From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of 
                the merchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was 
                among those who saw him come out from the merchants' hall with 
                tears of emotion in his eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely 
                begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes 
                and he concluded in a trembling voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor 
                he was coming out accompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre 
                knew, a fat otkupshchik. The other was the mayor, a man with a 
                thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled 
                the thin man's eyes, and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like 
                a child and kept repeating:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our lives and property- take them, Your Majesty!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that 
                he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. 
                He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency 
                and sought an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count 
                Mamonov was furnishing a regiment, Bezukhov at once informed Rostopchin 
                that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance.</p>
              <p> 　　Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without 
                tears, and at once consented to Petya's request and went himself 
                to enter his name.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all 
                took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes 
                and clubs, and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards 
                about the enrollment, feeling amazed themselves at what they had 
                done. </p>

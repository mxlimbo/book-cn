              <p> 　　In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected 
                letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her 
                strange and surprising news. He informed her of his engagement 
                to Natasha Rostova. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for 
                his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister. 
                He wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now 
                did he understand and know what life was. He asked his sister 
                to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve when he 
                had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his 
                father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her 
                father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear 
                the brunt of his displeasure without attaining her object. &quot;Besides,&quot; 
                he wrote, &quot;the matter was not then so definitely settled 
                as it is now. My father then insisted on a delay of a year and 
                now already six months, half of that period, have passed, and 
                my resolution is firmer than ever. If the doctors did not keep 
                me here at the spas I should be back in Russia, but as it is I 
                have to postpone my return for three months. You know me and my 
                relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have been and 
                always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse 
                his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short 
                time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him 
                about the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to 
                hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole 
                matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce 
                the term by four months.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary 
                gave the letter to her father. The next day the old prince said 
                to her quietly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... 
                It won't be long- I shall soon set him free.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess was about to reply, but her father would not 
                let her speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, 
                eh? Rich, eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! 
                Write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She 
                will be little Nicholas' stepmother and I'll marry Bourienne!... 
                Ha, ha, ha! He mustn't be without a stepmother either! Only one 
                thing, no more women are wanted in my house- let him marry and 
                live by himself. Perhaps you will go and live with him too?&quot; 
                he added, turning to Princess Mary. &quot;Go in heavens name! 
                Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!</p>
              <p> 　　After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about 
                the matter. But repressed vexation at his son's poor-spirited 
                behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter. To 
                his former pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added- allusions 
                to stepmothers and amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why shouldn't I marry her?&quot; he asked his daughter. 
                &quot;She'll make a splendid princess!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary 
                noticed that her father was really associating more and more with 
                the Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception 
                of his letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their 
                father to the idea.</p>
              <p> 　　Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and 
                religion were Princess Mary's joys and consolations; but besides 
                that, since everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in 
                the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope 
                that supplied the chief consolation of her life. This comforting 
                dream and hope were given her by God's folk- the half-witted and 
                other pilgrims who visited her without the prince's knowledge. 
                The longer she lived, the more experience and observation she 
                had of life, the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness 
                of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, 
                suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to obtain that 
                impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved 
                his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind 
                his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because 
                he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. 
                And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another 
                and injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment 
                of benefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know 
                this ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth 
                and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation; 
                yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it. &quot;How 
                is it that no one realizes this?&quot; thought Princess Mary. 
                &quot;No one except these despised God's folk who, wallet on back, 
                come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the prince, 
                not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him to 
                sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, 
                in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags 
                from place to place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm 
                but praying for all- for those who drive one away as well as for 
                those who protect one: higher than that life and truth there is 
                no life or truth!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of 
                fifty called Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about 
                barefoot and worn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly 
                fond of her. Once, when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before 
                the icon Theodosia was talking of her life, the thought that Theodosia 
                alone had found the true path of life suddenly came to Princess 
                Mary with such force that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself. 
                When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary thought about this 
                for a long time, and at last made up her mind that, strange as 
                it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed this 
                thought to no one but to her confessor, Father Akinfi, the monk, 
                and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for 
                the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim's complete costume 
                for herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black 
                kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this 
                secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time 
                had not already come to put her project into execution.</p>
              <p> 　　Often, listening to the pilgrims' tales, she was so stimulated 
                by their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full 
                of deep meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning 
                everything and running away from home. In imagination she already 
                pictured herself by Theodosia's side, dressed in coarse rags, 
                walking with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, 
                directing her wanderings from one saint's shrine to another, free 
                from envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the place 
                where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and 
                bliss.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having 
                time to get used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. 
                I will go on till my legs fail, and I'll lie down and die somewhere, 
                and shall at last reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there 
                is neither sorrow nor sighing...&quot; thought Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little 
                Koko (Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt 
                that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more 
                than God. </p>

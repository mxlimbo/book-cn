              <p>　　The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing 
                together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. 
                At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, 
                and the last battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denisov's squadron 
                of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the 
                enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but 
                was not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from 
                the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising 
                ground only half a mile away. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland 
                over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly 
                on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops 
                in blue uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack 
                scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men 
                of Denisov's squadron, though they tried to talk of other things 
                and to look in other directions, thought only of what was there 
                on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing 
                on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy's troops. The 
                weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending 
                brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was 
                calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy 
                could be heard from the hill. There was no one now between the 
                squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An 
                empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated 
                them. The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, 
                and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all 
                the more clearly felt.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the 
                line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, 
                and death. And what is there? Who is there?- there beyond that 
                field, that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but 
                one wants to know. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and 
                know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have 
                to find out what is there, just as you will inevitably have to 
                learn what lies the other side of death. But you are strong, healthy, 
                cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly 
                animated and healthy men.&quot; So thinks, or at any rate feels, 
                anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives 
                a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything 
                that takes place at such moments.</p>
              <p> 　　On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon 
                rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. 
                The officers who had been standing together rode off to their 
                places. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence 
                fell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front 
                and at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A 
                second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were 
                firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle 
                flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond 
                them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each 
                shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows 
                of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the 
                ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The 
                soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious 
                to see their comrades' impression. Every face, from Denisov's 
                to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, 
                irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster 
                frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. 
                Cadet Mironov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostov on the 
                left flank, mounted on his Rook- a handsome horse despite its 
                game leg- had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a 
                large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will 
                distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear, 
                bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat 
                under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication 
                of something new and stern showed round the mouth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who's that curtseying there? Cadet Miwonov! That's not 
                wight! Look at me,&quot; cried Denisov who, unable to keep still 
                on one spot, kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.</p>
              <p> 　　The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov, and his 
                whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy 
                fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just 
                as it usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied 
                his second bottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy 
                head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs 
                mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting 
                as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the 
                other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the 
                men to look to their pistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The staff 
                captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet 
                him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only 
                his eyes were brighter than usual.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what about it?&quot; said he to Denisov. &quot;It 
                won't come to a fight. You'll see- we shall retire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The devil only knows what they're about!&quot; muttered 
                Denisov. &quot;Ah, Wostov,&quot; he cried noticing the cadet's 
                bright face, &quot;you've got it at last.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. 
                Rostov felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared 
                on the bridge. Denisov galloped up to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll dwive them 
                off.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Attack indeed!&quot; said the colonel in a bored voice, 
                puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. &quot;And 
                why are you stopping here? Don't you see the skirmishers are retreating? 
                Lead the squadron back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire 
                without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had 
                been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks 
                quitted the farther side of the river.</p>
              <p> 　　The two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired 
                up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich 
                Schubert, came up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace 
                not far from Rostov, without taking any notice of him although 
                they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter 
                concerning Telyanin. Rostov, feeling that he was at the front 
                and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he 
                had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel's athletic 
                back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed 
                to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him, 
                and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet's courage, so 
                he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed 
                to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage. 
                Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate 
                attack just to punish him- Rostov. Then he imagined how, after 
                the attack, Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and 
                would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.</p>
              <p> 　　The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the Pavlograds 
                as he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. 
                After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained 
                in the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at 
                the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the 
                staff, and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer 
                to Prince Bagration. He now came to his former chief with an order 
                from the commander of the rear guard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Colonel,&quot; he said, addressing Rostov's enemy with 
                an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, &quot;there 
                is an order to stop and fire the bridge.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;An order to who?&quot; asked the colonel morosely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't myself know 'to who,'&quot; replied the cornet 
                in a serious tone, &quot;but the prince told me to 'go and tell 
                the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the 
                bridge.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up 
                to the colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout 
                Nesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely 
                carry his weight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How's this, Colonel?&quot; he shouted as he approached. 
                &quot;I told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone 
                and blundered; they are all beside themselves over there and one 
                can't make anything out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to 
                Nesvitski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You spoke to me of inflammable material,&quot; said 
                he, &quot;but you said nothing about firing it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, my dear sir,&quot; said Nesvitski as he drew up, 
                taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration 
                with his plump hand, &quot;wasn't I telling you to fire the bridge, 
                when inflammable material had been put in position?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, and you 
                did not tell me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it 
                is my habit orders strictly to obey. You said the bridge would 
                be burned, but who would it burn, I could not know by the holy 
                spirit!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, that's always the way!&quot; said Nesvitski with 
                a wave of the hand. &quot;How did you get here?&quot; said he, 
                turning to Zherkov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring 
                you out!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...&quot; continued 
                the colonel in an offended tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Colonel,&quot; interrupted the officer of the suite, 
                &quot;You must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to 
                use grapeshot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at 
                the stout staff officer, and at Zherkov, and he frowned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will the bridge fire,&quot; he said in a solemn tone 
                as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had 
                to endure he would still do the right thing.</p>
              <p> 　　Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were 
                to blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered 
                the second squadron, that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov, 
                to return to the bridge.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, it's just as I thought,&quot; said Rostov to 
                himself. &quot;He wishes to test me!&quot; His heart contracted 
                and the blood rushed to his face. &quot;Let him see whether I 
                am a coward!&quot; he thought.</p>
              <p> 　　Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious 
                expression appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostov 
                watched his enemy, the colonel, closely- to find in his face confirmation 
                of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at 
                Rostov, and looked as he always did when at the front, solemn 
                and stern. Then came the word of command.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look sharp! Look sharp!&quot; several voices repeated 
                around him.</p>
              <p> 　　Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, 
                the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to 
                do. The men were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked 
                at the colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind 
                the hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand 
                trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly's charge, and he 
                felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denisov rode past 
                him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostov saw nothing but 
                the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their 
                sabers clattering.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stretchers!&quot; shouted someone behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant; 
                he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at 
                the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, 
                trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At boss zides, Captain,&quot; he heard the voice of 
                the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse 
                near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his 
                enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went 
                to the front the better. But Bogdanich, without looking at or 
                recognizing Rostov, shouted to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who's that running on the middle of the bridge? To the 
                right! Come back, Cadet!&quot; he cried angrily; and turning to 
                Denisov, who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks 
                of the bridge:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,&quot; he 
                said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, every bullet has its billet,&quot; answered Vaska 
                Denisov, turning in his saddle. </p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite 
                were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now 
                the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets 
                braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming 
                near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance 
                from the opposite side- the blue uniforms and groups with horses, 
                easily recognizable as artillery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will they burn the bridge or not? Who'll get there first? 
                Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get 
                within grapeshot range and wipe them out?&quot; These were the 
                questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the 
                bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart- watching 
                the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the 
                blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets 
                and guns.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!&quot; said Nesvitski; 
                &quot;they are within grapeshot range now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He shouldn't have taken so many men,&quot; said the 
                officer of the suite.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;True enough,&quot; answered Nesvitski; &quot;two smart 
                fellows could have done the job just as well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, your excellency,&quot; put in Zherkov, his eyes 
                fixed on the hussars, but still with that naive air that made 
                it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. 
                &quot;Ah, your excellency! How you look at things! Send two men? 
                And who then would give us the Vladimir medal and ribbon? But 
                now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be recommended 
                for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdanich knows how things 
                are done.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now!&quot; said the officer of the suite, &quot;that's 
                grapeshot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being 
                detached and hurriedly removed.</p>
              <p> 　　On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of 
                smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, 
                and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was 
                seen. Then two reports one after another, and a third.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, 
                seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. &quot;Look! A man 
                has fallen! Fallen, fallen!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Two, I think.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I were Tsar I would never go to war,&quot; said Nesvitski, 
                turning away.</p>
              <p> 　　The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their 
                blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared 
                again but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled 
                onto the bridge. But this time Nesvitski could not see what was 
                happening there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The 
                hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries 
                were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because 
                the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.</p>
              <p> 　　The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before 
                the hussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and 
                the shot went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of 
                a group of hussars and knocked three of them over.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused 
                on the bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew 
                down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could 
                he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning 
                straw with him like the other soldiers. He stood looking about 
                him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts 
                were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the 
                rails with a groan. Rostov ran up to him with the others. Again 
                someone shouted, &quot;Stretchers!&quot; Four men seized the hussar 
                and began lifting him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone!&quot; cried the 
                wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for something, 
                gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, 
                and at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, 
                and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With 
                what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And 
                fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, 
                the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled 
                in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... 
                &quot;I should wishing for nothing else, nothing, if only I were 
                there,&quot; thought Rostov. &quot;In myself alone and in that 
                sunshine there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, 
                fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... There- they are shouting 
                again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run 
                with them, and it, death, is here above me and around... Another 
                instant and I shall never again see the sun, this water, that 
                gorge!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and 
                other stretchers came into view before Rostov. And the fear of 
                death and of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, 
                all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, 
                and protect me!&quot; Rostov whispered.</p>
              <p> 　　The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their 
                voices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from 
                sight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, fwiend? So you've smelt powdah!&quot; shouted 
                Vaska Denisov just above his ear.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's all over; but I am a coward- yes, a coward!&quot; 
                thought Rostov, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which 
                stood resting one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Was that grapeshot?&quot; he asked Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes and no mistake!&quot; cried Denisov. &quot;You worked 
                like wegular bwicks and it's nasty work! An attack's pleasant 
                work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the 
                very devil, with them shooting at you like a target.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostov, 
                composed of the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer from 
                the suite.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, it seems that no one has noticed,&quot; thought 
                Rostov. And this was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone 
                knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time 
                had experienced.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here's something for you to report,&quot; said Zherkov. 
                &quot;See if I don't get promoted to a sublieutenancy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!&quot; said 
                the colonel triumphantly and gaily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And if he asks about the losses?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A trifle,&quot; said the colonel in his bass voice: 
                &quot;two hussars wounded, and one knocked out,&quot; he added, 
                unable to restrain a happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase &quot;knocked 
                out&quot; with ringing distinctness. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army 
                at the end of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, 
                occupied the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, 
                trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was 
                said to be cut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied 
                with the general course of affairs in the Russian army, but no 
                one anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, 
                and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western, 
                the Polish, provinces.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been 
                assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single 
                town or large village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense 
                number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living 
                in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river, 
                over a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly 
                three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolkonski stiffly and 
                coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention 
                him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked 
                him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince 
                Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had 
                gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His 
                mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting 
                a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the 
                distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin. During the first 
                four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew 
                rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own 
                knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite 
                opinion about it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous 
                or disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his 
                military experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, 
                he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered 
                plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected 
                movements of the enemy- that cannot be foreseen- are met, and 
                on how and by whom the whole matter is handled. To clear up this 
                last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his position 
                and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control 
                of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced 
                for himself the following of the state of affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　While the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces had 
                been divided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay 
                de Tolly, secondly, the army under Bagration, and thirdly, the 
                one commanded by Tormasov. The Emperor was with the first army, 
                but not as commander in chief. In the orders issued it was stated, 
                not that the Emperor would take command, but only that he would 
                be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him not a commander 
                in chief's staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance 
                on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General 
                Prince Volkonski, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, 
                diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but not 
                the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the 
                Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakcheev, the ex-Minister 
                of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand 
                Duke Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich; Count Rumyantsev, the Chancellor; 
                Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; 
                Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an 
                adjutant general and Sardinian emigre; Wolzogen- and many others. 
                Though these men had no military appointment in the army, their 
                position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or 
                even the commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he 
                was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakcheev, or Prince 
                Volkonski, or was given this or that advice and did not know whether 
                a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the 
                man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be executed 
                or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential 
                significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people, 
                from a courtier's point of view (and in an Emperor's vicinity 
                all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the 
                Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed 
                of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakcheev 
                was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign's 
                bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna province who 
                appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but was in reality 
                a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace 
                Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited him to be. 
                The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful 
                and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally. 
                Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of self-confidence, 
                a quality that always influenced Alexander. Paulucci was there 
                because he was bold and decided in speech. The adjutants general 
                were there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and lastly 
                and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of 
                campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to believe 
                in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business 
                of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel's thoughts 
                in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, 
                bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone 
                else) was able to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and 
                unexpected ideas every day- especially the foreigners, who did 
                so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country 
                not their own- there were many secondary personages accompanying 
                the army because their principals were there.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, 
                and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply 
                defined subdivisions of and parties:</p>
              <p> 　　The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents- military 
                theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws- 
                laws of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and 
                his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country 
                in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of 
                war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention 
                in every deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the 
                foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.</p>
              <p> 　　The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, 
                as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The 
                members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from 
                Vilna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides 
                being advocates of bold action, this section also represented 
                nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. 
                They were Russians: Bagration, Ermolov (who was beginning to come 
                to the front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Ermolov's 
                was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned 
                the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering 
                Suvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick 
                pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of 
                Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.</p>
              <p> 　　To the third party- in which the Emperor had most confidence- 
                belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between 
                the other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and 
                to whom Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what men who have 
                no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They 
                said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius 
                as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply 
                devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect 
                Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged 
                that the theorists are often one sided, and therefore one should 
                not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel's 
                opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, 
                and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention 
                of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel's plan, but on changing 
                the movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither 
                one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to 
                the adherents of this third party.</p>
              <p> 　　Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was 
                the Tsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, 
                where he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque 
                and cavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French 
                gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line 
                had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this 
                party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their 
                opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their 
                own weakness, and frankly said so. They said: &quot;Nothing but 
                sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this! We have abandoned 
                Vilna and Vitebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only reasonable 
                thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible, before 
                we are turned out of Petersburg.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This view was very general in the upper army circles and found 
                support also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, 
                who, for other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.</p>
              <p> 　　The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay 
                de Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander 
                in chief. &quot;Be he what he may&quot; (they always began like 
                that), &quot;he is an honest, practical man and we have nobody 
                better. Give him real power, for war cannot be conducted successfully 
                without unity of command, and he will show what he can do, as 
                he did in Finland. If our army is well organized and strong and 
                has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering any defeats, we owe 
                this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to be superseded by 
                Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his incapacity 
                already in 1807.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, 
                that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced 
                than Bennigsen: &quot;and twist about as you may, you will have 
                to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes 
                now!&quot; said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa was 
                a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. &quot;The 
                more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be 
                understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. 
                What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, 
                who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice- 
                a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen 
                is the only such man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are 
                always to be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of 
                whom there were particularly many round Alexander- generals and 
                imperial aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not 
                merely as a monarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, 
                as Rostov had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the 
                virtues but all human capabilities as well. These men, though 
                enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army, 
                yet blamed him for such excessive modesty, and only desired and 
                insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence 
                and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of 
                the army, gather round him a commander in chief's staff, and, 
                consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary, 
                would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be 
                raised to the highest pitch.</p>
              <p> 　　The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers 
                was to the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who 
                desired neither peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive 
                camp at the Drissa or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, 
                neither Pfuel nor Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing- 
                as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible. In 
                the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues 
                that eddied about the Emperor's headquarters, it was possible 
                to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times. A man who 
                simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with 
                Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after, merely to 
                avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare that 
                he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to 
                gain some advantage would attract the Emperor's attention by loudly 
                advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before, 
                and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast 
                and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby 
                proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common 
                good. A third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils 
                would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, 
                well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse 
                him. A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often 
                come accidentally under the Emperor's eye. A fifth, to achieve 
                his long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly 
                insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion 
                and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible 
                and correct.</p>
              <p> 　　All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, 
                and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock 
                of imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any 
                direction, this whole drone population of the army began blowing 
                hard that way, so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to 
                turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncertainties of the position, with 
                the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character 
                to everything, amid this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict 
                of views and feelings, and the diversity of race among these people- 
                this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal 
                interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common 
                task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these drones, without 
                having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to 
                the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of 
                those who were disputing honestly.</p>
              <p> 　　From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew 
                reached the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and 
                was beginning to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, 
                reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs, who, 
                without sharing any of those conflicting opinions, were able to 
                take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters 
                and to consider means of escape from this muddle, indecision, 
                intricacy, and weakness.</p>
              <p> 　　The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong 
                resulted chiefly from the Emperor's presence in the army with 
                his military court and from the consequent presence there of an 
                indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations, 
                which is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign 
                should reign but not command the army, and that the only way out 
                of the position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave 
                the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the 
                action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety, 
                and that the worst commander in chief if independent would be 
                better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority 
                of the monarch.</p>
              <p> 　　Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa, 
                Shishkov, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives 
                of this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakcheev and 
                Balashev agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission 
                given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, 
                he respectfully suggested- on the plea that it was necessary for 
                the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the 
                capital- that the Emperor should leave the army.</p>
              <p> 　　That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call 
                to them to defend their country- the very incitement which was 
                the chief cause of Russia's triumph in so far as it was produced 
                by the Tsar's personal presence in Moscow- was suggested to the 
                Emperor, and accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.</p>

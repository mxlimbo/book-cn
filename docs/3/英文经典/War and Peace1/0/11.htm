              <p> 　　Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling 
                affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed 
                if they now rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter 
                was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at 
                her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps 
                of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair 
                falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the 
                folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in 
                the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended 
                her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared 
                a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, 
                a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.</p>
              <p> 　　The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread 
                his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run 
                in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, here she is!&quot; he exclaimed laughing. &quot;My 
                pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ma chere, there is a time for everything,&quot; said 
                the countess with feigned severity. &quot;You spoil her, Ilya,&quot; 
                she added, turning to her husband.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns 
                of your name day,&quot; said the visitor. &quot;What a charming 
                child,&quot; she added, addressing the mother.</p>
              <p> 　　This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of 
                life- with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved 
                and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare 
                arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers- 
                was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, 
                though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father 
                she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla- 
                not paying the least attention to her severe remark- and began 
                to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain 
                about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...&quot; was 
                all Natasha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). 
                She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing 
                fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining 
                in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,&quot; 
                said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, 
                and turning to the visitor she added: &quot;She is my youngest 
                girl.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla, 
                glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her 
                face.</p>
              <p> 　　The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought 
                it necessary to take some part in it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell me, my dear,&quot; said she to Natasha, &quot;is 
                Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to 
                childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna 
                Mikhaylovna's son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest 
                son; Sonya, the count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya, 
                his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and 
                were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum 
                the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently 
                in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, 
                the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing-room talk 
                of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. Now 
                and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress 
                their laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from 
                childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though 
                not alike. Boris was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome 
                face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly 
                hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on 
                his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. 
                Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently 
                tried to find something to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary 
                at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously 
                how he had know that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young 
                lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the 
                five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right 
                across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Natasha. She 
                turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was 
                screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and 
                unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed 
                from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. 
                Boris did not laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you 
                want the carriage?&quot; he asked his mother with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,&quot; she 
                answered, returning his smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. 
                The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program 
                had been disturbed.</p>

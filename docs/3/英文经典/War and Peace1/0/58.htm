              <p> 　　The day after the review, Boris, in his best uniform and with 
                his comrade Berg's best wishes for success, rode to Olmutz to 
                see Bolkonski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain 
                for himself the best post he could- preferably that of adjutant 
                to some important personage, a position in the army which seemed 
                to him most attractive. &quot;It is all very well for Rostov, 
                whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk 
                about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey, 
                but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and 
                must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of them!&quot; 
                he reflected.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmutz that day, but the 
                appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic 
                corps were stationed and the two Emperors were living with their 
                suites, households, and courts only strengthened his desire to 
                belong to that higher world.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman's uniform, 
                all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant 
                carriages with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers 
                and military men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant 
                officer of the Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but 
                simply could not, be aware of his existence. At the quarters of 
                the commander in chief, Kutuzov, where he inquired for Bolkonski, 
                all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they 
                wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were 
                always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them. 
                In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November 
                15, after dinner he again went to Olmutz and, entering the house 
                occupied by Kutuzov, asked for Bolkonski. Prince Andrew was in 
                and Boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for 
                dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of various 
                kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest 
                the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, 
                writing. Another, the red, stout Nesvitski, lay on a bed with 
                his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat 
                down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, 
                while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkonski 
                was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on 
                seeing Boris. The one who was writing and whom Boris addressed 
                turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski was on duty and that 
                he should go through the door on the left into the reception room 
                if he wished to see him. Boris thanked him and went to the reception 
                room, where he found some ten officers and generals.</p>
              <p> 　　When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously 
                (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly 
                says, &quot;If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for 
                a moment&quot;), was listening to an old Russian general with 
                decorations, who stood very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier's 
                obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, then, be so good as to wait,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation 
                he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing 
                Boris, Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran 
                after him imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned 
                to him with a cheerful smile.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised, 
                that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed 
                in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, 
                there was another, more important, subordination, which made this 
                tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain 
                Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant 
                Drubetskoy. More than ever was Boris resolved to serve in future 
                not according to the written code, but under this unwritten law. 
                He felt now that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew 
                he had already risen above the general who at the front had the 
                power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew 
                came up to him and took his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I 
                was fussing about with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother 
                to survey the dispositions. When Germans start being accurate, 
                there's no end to it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding 
                to as something generally known. But it the first time he had 
                heard Weyrother's name, or even the term &quot;dispositions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? 
                I have been thinking about you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I was thinking&quot;- for some reason Boris could 
                not help blushing- &quot;of asking the commander in chief. He 
                has had a letter from Prince Kuragin about me. I only wanted to 
                ask because I fear the Guards won't be in action,&quot; he added 
                as if in apology.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right. We'll talk it over,&quot; replied 
                Prince Andrew. &quot;Only let me report this gentleman's business, 
                and I shall be at your disposal.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced 
                general, that gentleman- evidently not sharing Boris' conception 
                of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination- looked 
                so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his 
                finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable. 
                He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return 
                from the commander in chief's room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about 
                you,&quot; said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large 
                room where the clavichord was. &quot;It's no use your going to 
                the commander in chief. He would say a lot of pleasant things, 
                ask you to dinner&quot; (&quot;That would not be bad as regards 
                the unwritten code,&quot; thought Boris), &quot;but nothing more 
                would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp 
                and adjutants! But this is what we'll do: I have a good friend, 
                an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov; 
                and though you may not know it, the fact is that now Kutuzov with 
                his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is now centered 
                round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorukov; I have to go there 
                anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall see 
                whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you 
                somewhere nearer the sun.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to 
                guide a young man and help him to worldly success. Under cover 
                of obtaining help of this kind for another, which from pride he 
                would never accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle 
                which confers success and which attracted him. He very readily 
                took up Boris' cause and went with him to Dolgorukov.</p>
              <p> 　　It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at 
                Olmutz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.</p>
              <p> 　　That same day a council of war had been held in which all 
                the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. 
                At that council, contrary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov 
                and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to advance immediately 
                and give battle to Bonaparte. The council of war was just over 
                when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace 
                to find Dolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the 
                spell of the day's council, at which the party of the young had 
                triumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised 
                waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely 
                silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence 
                of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at 
                the council- the coming battle and the victory that would certainly 
                result from it- no longer seemed to be in the future but in the 
                past. All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, 
                undoubtedly superior to Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, 
                the troops inspired by the Emperors' presence were eager for action. 
                The strategic position where the operations would take place was 
                familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: 
                a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver 
                the previous year on the very fields where the French had now 
                to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every 
                detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking 
                nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolgorukov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had 
                just returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager 
                and proud of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced 
                his protege, but Prince Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing 
                his hand said nothing to Boris and, evidently unable to suppress 
                the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, 
                addressed Prince Andrew in French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God 
                grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious! 
                However, dear fellow,&quot; he said abruptly and eagerly, &quot;I 
                must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially 
                to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge 
                of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility 
                even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions 
                better than our present ones could have been devised. This combination 
                of Austrian precision with Russian valor- what more could be wished 
                for?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So the attack is definitely resolved on?&quot; asked 
                Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that 
                Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter 
                was received from him today for the Emperor.&quot; Dolgorukov 
                smiled significantly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that so? And what did he say?&quot; inquired Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely 
                to gain time. I tell you he is in our hands, that's certain! But 
                what was most amusing,&quot; he continued, with a sudden, good-natured 
                laugh, &quot;was that we could not think how to address the reply! 
                If not as 'Consul' and of course not as 'Emperor,' it seemed to 
                me it should be to 'General Bonaparte.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling 
                him General Bonaparte, there is a difference,&quot; remarked Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's just it,&quot; interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, 
                laughing. &quot;You know Bilibin- he's a very clever fellow. He 
                suggested addressing him as 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolgorukov laughed merrily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only that?&quot; said Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form 
                for the address. He is a wise and clever fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What was it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement 
                francais,&quot; said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. &quot;Good, 
                wasn't it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,&quot; said Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he's dined 
                with him- the present Emperor- more than once in Paris, and tells 
                me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist- you know, 
                a combination of French adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do 
                you know the tale about him and Count Markov? Count Markov was 
                the only man who knew how to handle him. You know the story of 
                the handkerchief? It is delightful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to 
                Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov, our 
                ambassador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and 
                stood looking at Markov, probably expecting Markov to pick it 
                up for him, and how Markov immediately dropped his own beside 
                it and picked it up without touching Bonaparte's.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Delightful!&quot; said Bolkonski. &quot;But I have come 
                to you, Prince, as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You 
                see...&quot; but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp 
                came in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what a nuisance,&quot; said Dolgorukov, getting 
                up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris. 
                &quot;You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both 
                for you and for this dear young man.&quot; Again he pressed the 
                hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured, sincere, 
                and animated levity. &quot;But you see... another time!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the 
                higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was 
                conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set 
                in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment 
                he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They 
                followed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corridor and met- coming 
                out of the door of the Emperor's room by which Dolgorukov had 
                entered- a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and 
                sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, gave 
                him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short 
                man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at 
                Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him 
                and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. 
                Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his 
                face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who was that?&quot; asked Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant 
                of men- the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski.... 
                It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,&quot; added

              <p> 　　In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor's 
                arrival, but Rostov had no chance of being present at the review 
                he held at Bartenstein, as the Pavlograds were at the outposts 
                far beyond that place.</p>
              <p> 　　They were bivouacking. Denisov and Rostov were living in an 
                earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches 
                and turf. The hut was made in the following manner, which had 
                then come into vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, 
                four feet eight inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of 
                the trench, steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and 
                vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the lucky 
                ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on piles 
                at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each 
                side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about 
                two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. 
                The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle 
                of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close 
                to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the 
                soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof 
                at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass 
                in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers' 
                campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the 
                &quot;reception room&quot;- as Denisov called that part of the 
                hut- and it was then so warm that the officers, of whom there 
                were always some with Denisov and Rostov, sat in their shirt sleeves.</p>
              <p> 　　In April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, between 
                seven and eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for 
                embers, changed his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, 
                drank tea, got warm, then tidied up the things on the table and 
                in his own corner, and, his face glowing from exposure to the 
                wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay down on his back, 
                putting his arms under his head. He was pleasantly considering 
                the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering 
                expedition, and was awaiting Denisov, who had gone out somewhere 
                and with whom he wanted a talk.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind 
                the hut, evidently much excited. Rostov moved to the window to 
                see whom he was speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topcheenko.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I ordered you not to let them that Mashka woot stuff!&quot; 
                Denisov was shouting. &quot;And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk 
                bwought some fwom the fields.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have given the order again and again, your honor, 
                but they don't obey,&quot; answered the quartermaster.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: 
                &quot;Let him fuss and bustle now, my job's done and I'm lying 
                down- capitally!&quot; He could hear that Lavrushka- that sly, 
                bold orderly of Denisov's- was talking, as well as the quartermaster. 
                Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, 
                and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.</p>
              <p> 　　Then Denisov's voice was heard shouting farther and farther 
                away. &quot;Saddle! Second platoon!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are they off to now?&quot; thought Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　Five minutes later, Denisov came into the hut, climbed with 
                muddy boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his 
                things about, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and 
                went out again. In answer to Rostov's inquiry where he was going, 
                he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!&quot; 
                said Denisov going out, and Rostov heard the hoofs of several 
                horses splashing through the mud. He did not even trouble to find 
                out where Denisov had gone. Having got warm in his corner, he 
                fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening. Denisov 
                had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up, and near the 
                next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka, laughing 
                as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft 
                mud. Rostov joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers 
                saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny 
                horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up 
                to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, Denisov has been worrying,&quot; said Rostov, 
                &quot;and here are the provisions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So they are!&quot; said the officers. &quot;Won't the 
                soldiers be glad!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A little behind the hussars came Denisov, accompanied by two 
                infantry officers with whom he was talking.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov went to meet them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I warn you, Captain,&quot; one of the officers, a short 
                thin man, evidently very angry, was saying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Haven't I told you I won't give them up?&quot; replied 
                Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny- seizing 
                the transport of one's own army. Our men have had nothing to eat 
                for two days.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And mine have had nothing for two weeks,&quot; said 
                Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is robbery! You'll answer for it, sir!&quot; said 
                the infantry officer, raising his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, what are you pestewing me for?&quot; cried Denisov, 
                suddenly losing his temper. &quot;I shall answer for it and not 
                you, and you'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be 
                off! Go!&quot; he shouted at the officers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, then!&quot; shouted the little officer, undaunted 
                and not riding away. &quot;If you are determined to rob, I'll...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're safe and 
                sound!&quot; and Denisov turned his horse on the officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, very well!&quot; muttered the officer, threateningly, 
                and turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!&quot; 
                shouted Denisov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman 
                can address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostov, 
                he burst out laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've taken twansports from the infantwy by force!&quot; 
                he said. &quot;After all, can't let our men starve.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned 
                to an infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the 
                transport was unescorted, Denisov with his hussars had seized 
                it by force. The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, 
                and they even shared them with the other squadrons.</p>
              <p> 　　The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and 
                holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about 
                it and won't begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over 
                to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat 
                department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores 
                received. If not, as the demand was booked against an infantry 
                regiment, there will be a row and the affair may end badly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　From the regimental commander's, Denisov rode straight to 
                the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the 
                evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had 
                never yet seen him in. Denisov could not speak and gasped for 
                breath. When Rostov asked what was the matter, he only uttered 
                some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Alarmed at Denisov's condition, Rostov suggested that he should 
                undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them 
                twy me, but I'll always thwash scoundwels... and I'll tell the 
                Empewo'... Ice...&quot; he muttered.</p>
              <p> 　　The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely 
                necessary to bleed Denisov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken 
                from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had 
                happened to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I get there,&quot; began Denisov. &quot;'Now then, where's 
                your chief's quarters?' They were pointed out. 'Please to wait.' 
                'I've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no 
                time to wait. Announce me.' Vewy well, so out comes their head 
                chief- also took it into his head to lecture me: 'It's wobbewy!'- 
                'Wobbewy,' I say, 'is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to 
                feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets!' 
                'Will you please be silent?' 'Vewy good!' Then he says: 'Go and 
                give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair will be passed 
                on to headquarters.' I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at 
                the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it 
                that's starving us?&quot; shouted Denisov, hitting the table with 
                the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly 
                broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about. &quot;Telyanin! 
                'What? So it's you who's starving us to death! Is it? Take this 
                and this!' and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... 'Ah, 
                what a... what...!' and I sta'ted fwashing him... Well, I've had 
                a bit of fun I can tell you!&quot; cried Denisov, gleeful and 
                yet angry, his showing under his black mustache. &quot;I'd have 
                killed him if they hadn't taken him away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,&quot; 
                said Rostov. &quot;You've set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, 
                we must tie it up again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he 
                woke calm and cheerful.</p>
              <p> 　　But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov's 
                and Denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully 
                showed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental 
                commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence. 
                The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very 
                bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in 
                view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination 
                were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best 
                that could be hoped for.</p>
              <p> 　　The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, 
                after seizing the transports, Major Denisov, being drunk, went 
                to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called 
                him a thief, threatened to strike him, and on being led out had 
                rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing, and 
                dislocated the arm of one of them.</p>
              <p> 　　In answer to Rostov's renewed questions, Denisov said, laughing, 
                that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed 
                up in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did 
                not in the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels 
                dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would 
                not easily forget.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostov 
                knew him too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) 
                at heart he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, 
                which was evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry 
                and notices from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov 
                was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority 
                and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence 
                at the commissariat office. On the previous day Platov reconnoitered 
                with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denisov, 
                as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his 
                courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the 
                fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time Denisov would 
                not have left the regiment for so slight a wound, but now he took 
                advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff 
                and went into hospital.</p>

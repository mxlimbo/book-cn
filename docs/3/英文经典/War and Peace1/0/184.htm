              <p> 　　Natasha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided 
                all external forms of pleasure- balls, promenades, concerts, and 
                theaters- but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her 
                laughter. She could not sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or 
                tried to sing by herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, 
                tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never 
                return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined 
                her young life which might have been so happy. Laughter and singing 
                in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. 
                Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever entered 
                her head. She said and felt at that time that no man was more 
                to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel 
                within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all 
                the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so 
                full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, &quot;Uncle,&quot; 
                and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe were 
                what she recalled oftenest and most painfully. What would she 
                not have given to bring back even a single day of that time! But 
                it was gone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived 
                her- that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment 
                would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live on.</p>
              <p> 　　It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she 
                had formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else 
                in the world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked 
                herself, &quot;What next?&quot; But there was nothing to come. 
                There was no joy in life, yet life was passing. Natasha apparently 
                tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted 
                nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in the house 
                and felt at ease only with her brother Petya. She liked to be 
                with him better than with the others, and when alone with him 
                she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those 
                who came to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. 
                It would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy, 
                greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did Count 
                Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found 
                great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful to 
                him for it; nothing good on Pierre's part seemed to her to be 
                an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone 
                that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed 
                embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence, especially 
                when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that something 
                they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She noticed 
                this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness, which 
                she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her. 
                After those involuntary words- that if he were free he would have 
                asked on his knees for her hand and her love- uttered at a moment 
                when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha 
                of his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, 
                which had then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless 
                words are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because 
                Pierre was a married man, but because Natasha felt very strongly 
                with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced 
                with Kuragin that it never entered her head that the relations 
                between him and herself could lead to love on her part, still 
                less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic 
                friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several 
                instances.</p>
              <p> 　　Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna 
                Belova, a country neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay 
                her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested 
                that Natasha should fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha 
                gladly welcomed the idea. Despite the doctor's orders that she 
                should not go out early in the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting 
                and preparing for the sacrament, not as they generally prepared 
                for it in the Rostov family by attending three services in their 
                own house, but as Agrafena Ivanovna did, by going to church every 
                day for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess was pleased with Natasha's zeal; after the poor 
                results of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she 
                hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines 
                and, though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor, 
                she agreed to Natasha's wish and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena 
                Ivanovna used to come to wake Natasha at three in the morning, 
                but generally found her already awake. She was afraid of being 
                late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest 
                dress and an old mantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, 
                went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. 
                By Agrafena Ivanovna's advice Natasha prepared herself not in 
                their own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout 
                Agrafena Ivanovna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty 
                life. There were never many people in the church; Natasha always 
                stood beside Belova in the customary place before an icon of the 
                Blessed Virgin, let into the screen before the choir on the left 
                side, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before something 
                great and incomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual morning 
                hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the 
                candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from 
                the window, she listened to the words of the service which she 
                tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her 
                personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades 
                of its own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still 
                to think that the wish to understand everything is pride, that 
                it is impossible to understand all, that it is only necessary 
                to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt guiding 
                her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and 
                when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply 
                asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy 
                upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of 
                all were those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour 
                when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping 
                the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep, 
                Natasha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility 
                of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, 
                and of happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling 
                grew every day. And the happiness of taking communion, or &quot;communing&quot; 
                as Agrafena Ivanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, 
                seemed to Natasha so great that she felt she should never live 
                till that blessed Sunday.</p>
              <p> 　　But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, 
                dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for 
                the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed 
                by the thought of the life that lay before her.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue 
                the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,&quot; 
                said he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. &quot;Only, 
                please be particular about it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be quite easy,&quot; he continued playfully, as he adroitly 
                took the gold coin in his palm. &quot;She will soon be singing 
                and frolicking about. The last medicine has done her a very great 
                deal of good. She has freshened up very much.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked 
                down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to 
                the drawing room.</p>

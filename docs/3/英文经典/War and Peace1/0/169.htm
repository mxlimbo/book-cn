              <p> 　　On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he 
                had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, 
                dukes, kings, and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed 
                favor to the emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, 
                reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, 
                presented pearls and diamonds of his own- that is, which he had 
                taken from other kings- to the Empress of Austria, and having, 
                as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the Empress Marie 
                Louise- who regarded him as her husband, though he had left another 
                wife in Paris- left her grieved by the parting which she seemed 
                hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed 
                in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, 
                and though the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, 
                calling him Monsieur mon frere, and sincerely assured him that 
                he did not want war and would always love and honor him- yet he 
                set off to join his army, and at every station gave fresh orders 
                to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east. He 
                went in a traveling coach with six horses, surrounded by pages, 
                aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, Thorn, 
                Danzig, and Konigsberg. At each of these towns thousands of people 
                met him with excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
              <p> 　　The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses 
                carried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June,* coming 
                up with the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for 
                him on <br>
                the estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest. </p>
              <p> 　　*Old style. </p>
              <p> 　　Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the 
                Niemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank 
                in order to select a place for the crossing.</p>
              <p> 　　Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and 
                the wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy 
                city of Moscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm 
                such as the Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched- 
                Napoleon unexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic 
                considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army 
                began to cross the Niemen.</p>
              <p> 　　Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of 
                his tent, which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of 
                the Niemen, and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his 
                troops pouring out of the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over 
                the three bridges thrown across the river. The troops, knowing 
                of the Emperor's presence, were on the lookout for him, and when 
                they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat 
                standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill, 
                they threw up their caps and shouted: &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot; 
                and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the 
                vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on 
                and on by the three bridges to the other side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now we'll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand 
                himself, things get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive 
                l'Empereur! So these are the steppes of Asia! It's a nasty country 
                all the same. Au revoir, Beauche; I'll keep the best palace in 
                Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? 
                Vive l'Empereur!... preur!- If they make me Governor of India, 
                Gerard, I'll make you Minister of Kashmir- that's settled. Vive 
                l'Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks- those rascals- 
                see how they run! Vive l'Empereur! There he is, do you see him? 
                I've seen him twice, as I see you now. The little corporal... 
                I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive l'Empereur!&quot; 
                came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse characters 
                and social positions. On the faces of all was one common expression 
                of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and of 
                rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing 
                on the hill.</p>
              <p> 　　On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab 
                horse was brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop 
                to one of the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by 
                incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured 
                only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express 
                their love of him by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied 
                him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military 
                cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army. 
                He rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther 
                side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in the direction 
                of Kovno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard 
                who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for 
                him through the troops. On reaching the broad river Viliya, he 
                stopped near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vivat!&quot; shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking 
                their ranks and pressing against one another to see him.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat 
                down on a log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a 
                telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy 
                page who had run up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. 
                Then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without 
                lifting his head he said something, and two of his aides-de-camp 
                galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? What did he say?&quot; was heard in the ranks 
                of the Polish Uhlans when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel 
                of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling 
                in his speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether 
                he would be permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead 
                of seeking a ford. In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking 
                for permission to get on a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim 
                across the river before the Emperor's eyes. The aide-de-camp replied 
                that probably the Emperor would not be displeased at this excess 
                of zeal.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached 
                officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, 
                shouted &quot;Vivat!&quot; and, commanding the Uhlans to follow 
                him, spurred his horse and galloped into the river. He gave an 
                angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive under him, 
                and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where 
                the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. 
                It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of 
                the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they 
                fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some 
                of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and 
                some clinging to their horses' manes. They tried to make their 
                way forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford 
                one third of a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and 
                drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the 
                log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When the 
                aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment, 
                ventured to draw the Emperor's attention to the devotion of the 
                Poles to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up 
                and, having summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank 
                with him, giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly 
                at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.</p>
              <p> 　　For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any 
                part of the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, 
                was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. 
                He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats 
                were sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to 
                the bank from which they had started. The colonel and some of 
                his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further 
                bank. And as soon as they had got out, in their soaked and streaming 
                clothes, they shouted &quot;Vivat!&quot; and looked ecstatically 
                at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he no longer was 
                and at that moment considered themselves happy.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian 
                paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as 
                quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on 
                whom a letter containing information about the orders to the French 
                army had been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the 
                Polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should 
                be enrolled in the Legion d'honneur of which Napoleon was himself 
                the head.</p>
              <p> 　　Quos vult perdere dementat.* </p>
              <p> 　　*Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.</p>

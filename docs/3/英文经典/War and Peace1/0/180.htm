              <p> 　　In the tavern, before which stood the doctor's covered cart, 
                there were already some five officers. Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump 
                little blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting 
                on a broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, 
                lay asleep behind her. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, 
                were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me, how jolly we are!&quot; said Rostov laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why do you stand there gaping?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! 
                Don't make our drawing room so wet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't mess Mary Hendrikhovna's dress!&quot; cried other 
                voices.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could 
                change into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna's 
                modesty. They were going into a tiny recess behind a partition 
                to change, but found it completely filled by three officers who 
                sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty 
                box, and these officers would on no account yield their position. 
                Mary Hendrikhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to 
                be used as a curtain, and behind that screen Rostov and Ilyin, 
                helped by Lavrushka who had brought their kits, changed their 
                wet things for dry ones.</p>
              <p> 　　A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board 
                was found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, 
                a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle 
                of rum, and having asked Mary Hendrikhovna to preside, they all 
                crowded round her. One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe 
                her charming hands, another spread a jacket under her little feet 
                to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat over the window 
                to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off her 
                husband's face, lest he should wake up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave him alone,&quot; said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling 
                timidly and happily. &quot;He is sleeping well as it is, after 
                a sleepless night.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna,&quot; replied the officer, 
                &quot;one must look after the doctor. Perhaps he'll take pity 
                on me someday, when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for 
                me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that 
                one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and 
                the samovar held only six tumblers of water, but this made it 
                all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive 
                one's tumbler from Mary Hendrikhovna's plump little hands with 
                their short and not overclean nails. All the officers appeared 
                to be, and really were, in love with her that evening. Even those 
                playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came 
                over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting 
                Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant 
                and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as she might 
                to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband 
                moved in his sleep behind her.</p>
              <p> 　　There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything 
                else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that 
                Mary Hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. 
                Rostov received his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary 
                Hendrikhovna to stir it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you take it without sugar?&quot; she said, smiling 
                all the time, as if everything she said and everything the others 
                said was very amusing and had a double meaning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little 
                hand should stir my tea.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon 
                which someone meanwhile had pounced on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Use your finger, Mary Hendrikhovna, it will be still 
                nicer,&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Too hot!&quot; she replied, blushing with pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　Ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and 
                brought it to Mary Hendrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her 
                finger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is my cup,&quot; said he. &quot;Only dip your finger 
                in it and I'll drink it all up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards 
                and proposed that they should play &quot;Kings&quot; with Mary 
                Hendrikhovna. They drew lots to settle who should make up her 
                set. At Rostov's suggestion it was agreed that whoever became 
                &quot;King&quot; should have the right to kiss Mary Hendrikhovna's 
                hand, and that the &quot;Booby&quot; should go to refill and reheat 
                the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is 'King'?&quot; 
                asked Ilyin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They had hardly begun to play before the doctor's disheveled 
                head suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had been 
                awake for some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently 
                found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His 
                face was sad and depressed. Without greeting the officers, he 
                scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were 
                blocking the way. As soon as he had left the room all the officers 
                burst into loud laughter and Mary Hendrikhovna blushed till her 
                eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive 
                to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor told his wife (who 
                had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting 
                her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep 
                in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I'll send an orderly.... Two of them!&quot; said 
                Rostov. &quot;What an idea, doctor!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll stand guard on it myself!&quot; said Ilyin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not 
                slept for two nights,&quot; replied the doctor, and he sat down 
                morosely beside his wife, waiting for the game to end.</p>
              <p> 　　Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers 
                grew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, 
                for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had 
                gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her 
                in their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering 
                themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a 
                long time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor's 
                uneasiness and his wife's delight, now they ran out into the porch 
                and reported what was taking place in the covered trap. Several 
                times Rostov, covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some 
                remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed, to 
                the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter. </p>

              <p> 　　The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre 
                was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance 
                of the Square, one side of which symbolized God, another moral 
                things, a third physical things, and the fourth a combination 
                of these. Now and then his attention wandered from the book and 
                the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life. On 
                the previous evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of 
                his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for 
                him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his estates 
                in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs. 
                He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vasili suddenly 
                entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? 
                Why have you quarreled with Helene, mon cher? You are under a 
                delusion,&quot; said Prince Vasili, as he entered. &quot;I know 
                all about it, and I can tell you positively that Helene is as 
                innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasili interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why didn't you simply come straight to me as to 
                a friend? I know all about it and understand it all,&quot; he 
                said. &quot;You behaved as becomes a man values his honor, perhaps 
                too hastily, but we won't go into that. But consider the position 
                in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society, and 
                even of the court,&quot; he added, lowering his voice. &quot;She 
                is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,&quot; 
                and he drew Pierre's arm downwards, &quot;it is simply a misunderstanding. 
                I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her a letter at 
                once, and she'll come here and all will be explained, or else, 
                my dear boy, let me tell you it's quite likely you'll have to 
                suffer for it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress 
                is taking a keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is 
                very gracious to Helene.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince 
                Vasili did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared 
                to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement 
                in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, 
                the words of the Masonic statutes, &quot;be kindly and courteous,&quot; 
                recurred to him. He blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, 
                struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult 
                thing in life- to say an unpleasant thing to a man's face, to 
                say what the other, whoever he might be, did not expect. He was 
                so used to submitting to Prince Vasili's tone of careless self-assurance 
                that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now, but he also 
                felt that on what he said now his future depended- whether he 
                would follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively 
                shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly believed he would 
                be reborn to a new life.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now, dear boy,&quot; said Prince Vasili playfully, &quot;say 
                'yes,' and I'll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted 
                calf.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech, 
                Pierre, without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made 
                him like his father, muttered in a whisper:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!&quot; 
                And he jumped up and opened the door for him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go!&quot; he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to 
                see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince 
                Vasili's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's the matter with you? Are you ill?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go!&quot; the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasili 
                had to go without receiving any explanation.</p>
              <p> 　　A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, 
                the Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, 
                went away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to 
                the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide 
                him in his new activity. </p>

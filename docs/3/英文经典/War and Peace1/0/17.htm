              <p> 　　After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit 
                Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov, Countess Rostova sat for a 
                long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At 
                last she rang.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter with you, my dear?&quot; she said 
                crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. &quot;Don't 
                you wish to serve me? Then I'll find you another place.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating 
                poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which 
                with her always found expression in calling her maid &quot;my 
                dear&quot; and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very sorry, ma'am,&quot; answered the maid.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ask the count to come to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty 
                look as usual.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere 
                we are to have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid 
                for Taras were not ill-spent. He is worth it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands 
                ruffling his gray hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are your commands, little countess?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, my dear... What's that mess?&quot; she said, 
                pointing to his waistcoat. &quot;It's, the saute, most likely,&quot; 
                she added with a smile. &quot;Well, you see, Count, I want some 
                money.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her face became sad.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, little countess!&quot;... and the count began bustling 
                to get out his pocketbook.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,&quot; 
                and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's 
                waistcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?&quot; 
                he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that 
                those they call will rush to obey the summons. &quot;Send Dmitri 
                to me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the 
                count's house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly 
                into the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what I want, my dear fellow,&quot; said the 
                count to the deferential young man who had entered. &quot;Bring 
                me...&quot; he reflected a moment, &quot;yes, bring me seven hundred 
                rubles, yes! But mind, don't bring me such tattered and dirty 
                notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please,&quot; said the countess, 
                sighing deeply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When would you like them, your excellency?&quot; asked 
                Dmitri. &quot;Allow me to inform you... But, don't be uneasy,&quot; 
                he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily 
                and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. &quot;I 
                was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a treasure that Dmitri is,&quot; added the count 
                with a smile when the young man had departed. &quot;There is never 
                any 'impossible' with him. That's a thing I hate! Everything is 
                possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in 
                the world,&quot; said the countess. &quot;But I am in great need 
                of this sum.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,&quot; 
                said the count, and having kissed his wife's hand he went back 
                to his study.</p>
              <p> 　　When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov's the money, 
                all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the 
                countess' little table, and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something 
                was agitating her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my dear?&quot; asked the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know 
                him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said 
                a word...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me,&quot; the 
                countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, 
                dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the 
                handkerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped 
                to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is for Boris from me, for his outfit.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The 
                countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because 
                they were kindhearted, and because they- friends from childhood- 
                had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their 
                youth was over.... But those tears were pleasant to them both.</p>

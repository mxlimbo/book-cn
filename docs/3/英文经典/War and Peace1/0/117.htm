              <p> 　　The Rostovs' monetary affairs had not improved during the 
                two years they had spent in the country.</p>
              <p> 　　Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and 
                was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively 
                little, the way of life at Otradnoe- Mitenka's management of affairs, 
                in particular- was such that the debts inevitably increased every 
                year. The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old 
                count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg 
                to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy 
                themselves for the last time.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera 
                and was accepted.</p>
              <p> 　　Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society 
                without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their 
                circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg 
                they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained 
                in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked 
                down on them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg 
                as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. 
                Country neighbors from Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and 
                their daughters, Peronskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, 
                and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post 
                in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors 
                at the Rostovs' house in Petersburg were Boris, Pierre whom the 
                count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg 
                who spent whole days at the Rostovs' and paid the eldest daughter, 
                Countess Vera, the attentions a young man pays when he intends 
                to propose.</p>
              <p> 　　Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded 
                at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. 
                He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important 
                an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his 
                deed, and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. 
                He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp 
                standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. 
                Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence 
                at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed 
                it had been necessary to do this, and he received two decorations 
                for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in the Guards, 
                wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg's merits, it 
                could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, 
                on excellent terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with 
                a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society.</p>
              <p> 　　Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls 
                of a Moscow theater, Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him 
                and had said in German, &quot;das soll mein Weib werden,&quot;* 
                and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her. Now in 
                Petersburg, having considered the Rostovs' position and his own, 
                he decided that the time had come to propose. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;That girl shall be my wife.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Berg's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that 
                was not flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the 
                son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to 
                a Countess Rostova; but Berg's chief characteristic was such a 
                naive and good natured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily 
                came to think it would be a good thing, since he himself was so 
                firmly convinced that it was good, indeed excellent. Moreover, 
                the Rostovs' affairs were seriously embarrassed, as the suitor 
                could not but know; and above all, Vera was twenty-four, had been 
                taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking 
                and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave 
                their consent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see,&quot; said Berg to his comrade, whom he called 
                &quot;friend&quot; only because he knew that everyone has friends, 
                &quot;you see, I have considered it all, and should not marry 
                if I had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable. 
                But on the contrary, my papa and mamma are now provided for- I 
                have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic Provinces- and 
                I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with her fortune and my 
                good management we can get along nicely. I am not marrying for 
                money- I consider that dishonorable- but a wife should bring her 
                share and a husband his. I have my position in the service, she 
                has connections and some means. In our times that is worth something, 
                isn't it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl, and 
                she loves me...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Berg blushed and smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I love her, because her character is sensible and 
                very good. Now the other sister, though they are the same family, 
                is quite different- an unpleasant character and has not the same 
                intelligence. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancee!... 
                Well, you will be coming,&quot; he was going to say, &quot;to 
                dine,&quot; but changed his mind and said &quot;to take tea with 
                us,&quot; and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round 
                ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents 
                by Berg's proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such 
                times took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external 
                and insincere. In the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain 
                awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed 
                of not having loved Vera sufficiently and of being so ready to 
                get her off their hands. The old count felt this most. He would 
                probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment, 
                but it resulted from the state of his affairs. He did not know 
                at all how much he had, what his debts amounted to, or what dowry 
                he could give Vera. When his daughters were born he had assigned 
                to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three hundred serfs; 
                but one of these estates had already been sold, and the other 
                was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would 
                have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to Vera. 
                Nor had he any money.</p>
              <p> 　　Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained 
                before the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own 
                mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. 
                At one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate 
                or of selling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on 
                a note of hand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the 
                count's study early one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully 
                asked his future father-in-law to let him know what Vera's dowry 
                would be. The count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen 
                inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that 
                came into his head. &quot;I like your being businesslike about 
                it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end 
                the conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that 
                if he did not know for certain how much Vera would have and did 
                not receive at least part of the dowry in advance, he would have 
                to break matters off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because, consider, Count- if I allowed myself to marry 
                now without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should 
                be acting badly....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous 
                and to avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a 
                note of hand for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed 
                the count on the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, 
                but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without 
                receiving thirty thousand in ready money. &quot;Or at least twenty 
                thousand, Count,&quot; he added, &quot;and then a note of hand 
                for only sixty thousand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, all right!&quot; said the count hurriedly. 
                &quot;Only excuse me, my dear fellow, I'll give you twenty thousand 
                and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss 
                me.&quot;</p>

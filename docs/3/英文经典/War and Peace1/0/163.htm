              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna, having found Sonya weeping in the corridor, 
                made her confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natasha 
                she read it and went into Natasha's room with it in her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You shameless good-for-nothing!&quot; said she. &quot;I 
                won't hear a word.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pushing back Natasha who looked at her with astonished but 
                tearless eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the 
                yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening, 
                but not to let them out again, and having told the footman to 
                bring them up to her, she seated herself in the drawing room to 
                await the abductors.</p>
              <p> 　　When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come 
                had run away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands 
                behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what 
                she should do. Toward midnight she went to Natasha's room fingering 
                the key in her pocket. Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. 
                &quot;Marya Dmitrievna, for God's sake let me in to her!&quot; 
                she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in 
                without giving her an answer.... &quot;Disgusting, abominable... 
                In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I'm only sorry for her father!&quot; 
                thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. &quot;Hard as it may 
                be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it 
                from the count.&quot; She entered the room with resolute steps. 
                Natasha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she 
                did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Marya 
                Dmitrievna had left her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A nice girl! Very nice!&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna. 
                &quot;Arranging meetings with lovers in my house! It's no use 
                pretending: you listen when I speak to you!&quot; And Marya Dmitrievna 
                touched her arm. &quot;Listen when when I speak! You've disgraced 
                yourself like the lowest of hussies. I'd treat you differently, 
                but I'm sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved 
                with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna 
                glanced round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's lucky for him that he escaped me; but I'll find 
                him!&quot; she said in her rough voice. &quot;Do you hear what 
                I am saying or not?&quot; she added.</p>
              <p> 　　She put her large hand under Natasha's face and turned it 
                toward her. Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they 
                saw how Natasha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her 
                lips compressed, her cheeks sunken.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!&quot; 
                she muttered, wrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna's hands 
                with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natalie!&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;I wish for 
                your good. Lie still, stay like that then, I won't touch you. 
                But listen. I won't tell you how guilty you are. You know that 
                yourself. But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to 
                tell him? Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Again Natasha's body shook with sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have no betrothed: I have refused him!&quot; cried 
                Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's all the same,&quot; continued Dmitrievna. &quot;If 
                they hear of this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know 
                him... if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right? 
                Eh?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? 
                Why? Who asked you to?&quot; shouted Natasha, raising herself 
                on the sofa and looking malignantly at Marya Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what did you want?&quot; cried Marya Dmitrievna, 
                growing angry again. &quot;Were you kept under lock and key? Who 
                hindered his coming to the house? Why carry you off as if you 
                were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he had carried you off... 
                do you think they wouldn't have found him? Your father, or brother, 
                or your betrothed? And he's a scoundrel, a wretch- that's a fact!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is better than any of you!&quot; exclaimed Natasha 
                getting up. &quot;If you hadn't interfered... Oh, my God! What 
                is it all? What is it? Sonya, why?... Go away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with 
                which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. 
                Marya Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!&quot; 
                and she threw herself back on the sofa.</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining 
                on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her 
                that nobody would know anything about it if only Natasha herself 
                would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something 
                had happened. Natasha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, 
                but she grew cold and had a shivering fit. Marya Dmitrievna put 
                a pillow under her head, covered her with two quilts, and herself 
                brought her some lime-flower water, but Natasha did not respond 
                to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, let her sleep,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna as 
                she went of the room supposing Natasha to be asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　But Natasha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open 
                eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not 
                sleep or weep and did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to 
                her several times.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day Count Rostov returned from his estate near Moscow 
                in time for lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; 
                the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and 
                there was nothing to keep him any longer in Moscow, away from 
                the countess whom he missed. Marya Dmitrievna met him and told 
                him that Natasha had been very unwell the day before and that 
                they had sent for the doctor, but that she was better now. Natasha 
                had not left her room that morning. With compressed and parched 
                lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily watching 
                the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone 
                who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him 
                and that he would come or would write to her.</p>
              <p> 　　When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round 
                at the sound of a man's footstep, and then her face resumed its 
                cold and malevolent expression. She did not even get up to greet 
                him. &quot;What is the matter with you, my angel? Are you ill?&quot; 
                asked the count.</p>
              <p> 　　After a moment's silence Natasha answered: &quot;Yes, ill.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In reply to the count's anxious inquiries as to why she was 
                so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, 
                she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to 
                worry. Marya Dmitrievna confirmed Natasha's assurances that nothing 
                had happened. From the pretense of illness, from his daughter's 
                distress, and by the embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna, 
                the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his 
                absence, but it was so terrible for him to think that anything 
                disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so prized 
                his own cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried 
                to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and 
                he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their 
                return to the country.</p>

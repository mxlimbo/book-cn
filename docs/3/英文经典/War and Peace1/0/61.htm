              <p> 　　Shortly after nine o'clock that evening, Weyrother drove with 
                his plans to Kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to 
                be held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander 
                in chief's and with the exception of Prince Bagration, who declined 
                to come, were all there at the appointed time.</p>
              <p> 　　Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, 
                by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to 
                the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the 
                part of chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother 
                evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had 
                already become unrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill 
                harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being 
                pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed 
                with no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother 
                had been twice that evening to the enemy's picket line to reconnoiter 
                personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to 
                report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated 
                the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived 
                at Kutuzov's.</p>
              <p> 　　He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite 
                to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly 
                and indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, 
                and did not reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered 
                with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though 
                at the same time he was haughty and self-confident.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions 
                near Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the 
                commander in chief's office were gathered Kutuzov himself, Weyrother, 
                and the members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, 
                and only awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council. At last 
                Bagration's orderly came with the news that the prince could not 
                attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief 
                of this and, availing himself of permission previously given him 
                by Kutuzov to be present at the council, he remained in the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin,&quot; 
                said Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to 
                the table on which an enormous map of the environs of Brunn was 
                spread out.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck 
                bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep 
                in a low chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically 
                on its arms. At the sound of Weyrother's voice, he opened his 
                one eye with an effort.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,&quot; said 
                he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his 
                eye.</p>
              <p> 　　If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov 
                was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the 
                reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that 
                moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire 
                to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else- he 
                was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. 
                He really was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too 
                busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutuzov and, having convinced 
                himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous 
                voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, 
                under a heading which he also read out:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind 
                Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They 
                began as follows:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As the enemy's left wing rests on wooded hills and his 
                right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that 
                are there, while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by 
                far outflank his right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy's 
                latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz 
                and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue 
                him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, 
                avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover 
                the enemy's front. For this object it is necessary that... The 
                first column marches... The second column marches... The third 
                column marches...&quot; and so on, read Weyrother.</p>
              <p> 　　The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult 
                dispositions. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning 
                his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, 
                and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen. 
                Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes 
                fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy 
                Miloradovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his 
                hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly 
                silent, gazing at Weyrother's face, and only turned away his eyes 
                when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Miloradovich 
                looked round significantly at the other generals. But one could 
                not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed 
                and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother 
                sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his 
                typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, 
                gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners 
                a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one 
                of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the 
                snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking 
                in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing 
                to say something. But the Austrian general, continuing to read, 
                frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: &quot;You 
                can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to look at 
                the map and listen.&quot; Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression 
                of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an explanation, 
                but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless gaze drooped 
                his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A geography lesson!&quot; he muttered as if to himself, 
                but loud enough to be heard.</p>
              <p> 　　Przebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held 
                his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed 
                in attention. Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, 
                with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread 
                map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar 
                locality. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he 
                had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother 
                complied and Dohkturov noted them down.</p>
              <p> 　　When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, 
                Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking 
                at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult 
                it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy's position 
                was assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since 
                the enemy was in movement. Langeron's objections were valid but 
                it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother- 
                who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as 
                if he were addressing school children- that he had to do, not 
                with fools, but with men who could teach him something in military 
                matters.</p>
              <p> 　　When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's voice ceased, Kutuzov 
                opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of 
                the mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, 
                as if remarking, &quot;So you are still at that silly business!&quot; 
                quickly closed his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.</p>
              <p> 　　Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother's 
                vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might 
                easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole 
                of this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections 
                with a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand 
                to meet all objections be they what they might.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he could attack us, he would have done so today,&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you think he is powerless?&quot; said Langeron.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has forty thousand men at most,&quot; replied Weyrother, 
                with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain 
                the treatment of a case.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our 
                attack,&quot; said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again 
                glancing round for support to Miloradovich who was near him.</p>
              <p> 　　But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of 
                anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ma foi!&quot; said he, &quot;tomorrow we shall see all 
                that on the battlefield.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to 
                him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian 
                generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced 
                himself of, but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise 
                is heard from his camp,&quot; said he. &quot;What does that mean? 
                Either he is retreating, which is the only thing we need fear, 
                or he is changing his position.&quot; (He smiled ironically.) 
                &quot;But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, 
                he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements 
                to the minutest detail remain the same.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is that?...&quot; began Prince Andrew, who had for 
                long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at 
                the generals.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow- or rather 
                for today, for it is past midnight- cannot now be altered,&quot; 
                said he. &quot;You have heard them, and we shall all do our duty. 
                But before a battle, there is nothing more important...&quot; 
                he paused, &quot;than to have a good sleep.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It 
                was past midnight. Prince Andrew went out. </p>
              <p> 　　The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able 
                to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague 
                and uneasy impression. Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, 
                Langeron, and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, 
                were right- he did not know. &quot;But was it really not possible 
                for Kutuzov to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible 
                that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands 
                of lives, and my life, my life,&quot; he thought, &quot;must be 
                risked?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,&quot; 
                he thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series 
                of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: 
                he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he 
                remembered the days when he first loved her. He thought of her 
                pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously 
                emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he 
                was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up and down before 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed 
                mysteriously. &quot;Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!&quot; he thought. 
                &quot;Tomorrow everything may be over for me! All these memories 
                will be no more, none of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow 
                perhaps, even certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first 
                time I shall have to show all I can do.&quot; And his fancy pictured 
                the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at one point, 
                and the hesitation of all the commanders. And then that happy 
                moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents 
                itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion 
                to Kutuzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck 
                by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to carry them 
                out, so he takes a regiment, a division- stipulates that no one 
                is to interfere with his arrangements- leads his division to the 
                decisive point, and gains the victory alone. &quot;But death and 
                suffering?&quot; suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, 
                did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. 
                The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone. 
                Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov's staff, but he does 
                everything alone. The next battle is won by him alone. Kutuzov 
                is removed and he is appointed... &quot;Well and then?&quot; asked 
                the other voice. &quot;If before that you are not ten times wounded, 
                killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...&quot; &quot;Well then,&quot; 
                Prince Andrew answered himself, &quot;I don't know what will happen 
                and don't want to know, and can't, but if I want this- want glory, 
                want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it is not my 
                fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only for 
                that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh 
                God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem? 
                Death, wounds, the loss of family- I fear nothing. And precious 
                and dear as many persons are to me- father, sister, wife- those 
                dearest to me- yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would 
                give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, 
                of love from men I don't know and never shall know, for the love 
                of these men here,&quot; he thought, as he listened to voices 
                in Kutuzov's courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies 
                who were packing up; one voice, probably a coachman's, was teasing 
                Kutuzov's old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called 
                Tit. He was saying, &quot;Tit, I say, Tit!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot; returned the old man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, Tit, thresh a bit!&quot; said the wag.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, go to the devil!&quot; called out a voice, drowned 
                by the laughter of the orderlies and servants.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over 
                them all, I value this mystic power and glory that is floating 
                here above me in this mist!&quot;</p>

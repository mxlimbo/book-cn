              <p> 　　&quot;Well begin!&quot; said Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right,&quot; said Pierre, still smiling in the same 
                way. A feeling of dread was in the air. It was evident that the 
                affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking 
                its course independently of men's will.</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov first went to the barrier and announced: &quot;As 
                the adve'sawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. 
                Take your pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!&quot; he shouted angrily and stepped 
                aside.</p>
              <p> 　　The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and 
                nearer to one another, beginning to see one another through the 
                mist. They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached 
                the barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol, 
                looking intently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into his 
                antagonist's face. His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So I can fire when I like!&quot; said Pierre, and at 
                the word &quot;three,&quot; he went quickly forward, missing the 
                trodden path and stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol 
                in his right hand at arm's length, apparently afraid of shooting 
                himself with it. His left hand he held carefully back, because 
                he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not 
                do so. Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into 
                the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then quickly glanced 
                at Dolokhov and, bending his finger as he had been shown, fired. 
                Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered at the 
                sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The 
                smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing 
                anything for an instant, but there was no second report as he 
                had expected. He only heard Dolokhov's hurried steps, and his 
                figure came in view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand 
                to his left side, while the other clutched his drooping pistol. 
                His face was pale. Rostov ran toward him and said something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No-o-o!&quot; muttered Dolokhov through his teeth, &quot;no, 
                it's not over.&quot; And after stumbling a few staggering steps 
                right up to the saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left 
                hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and supported himself 
                with it. His frowning face was pallid and quivered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Plea...&quot; began Dolokhov, but could not at first 
                pronounce the word.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please,&quot; he uttered with an effort.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward 
                Dolokhov and was about to cross the space between the barriers, 
                when Dolokhov cried:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To your barrier!&quot; and Pierre, grasping what was 
                meant, stopped by his saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dolokhov 
                lowered his head to the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised 
                his head, adjusted himself, drew in his legs and sat up, seeking 
                a firm center of gravity. He sucked and sucked and swallowed the 
                cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling, glittered 
                with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength. 
                He raised his pistol and aimed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!&quot; ejaculated 
                Nesvitski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cover yourself!&quot; even Denisov cried to his adversary.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms 
                and legs helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly 
                facing Dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him. Denisov, Rostov, and 
                Nesvitski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a 
                report and Dolokhov's angry cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Missed!&quot; shouted Dolokhov, and he lay helplessly, 
                face downwards on the snow.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the 
                forest, trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent 
                words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Folly... folly! Death... lies...&quot; he repeated, 
                puckering his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Nesvitski stopped him and took him home.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did 
                not answer a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering 
                Moscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, 
                took Rostov, who was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostov was 
                struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender 
                expression on Dolokhov's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well? How do you feel?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bad! But it's not that, my friend-&quot; said Dolokhov 
                with a gasping voice. &quot;Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I 
                don't matter, but I have killed her, killed... She won't get over 
                it! She won't survive....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who?&quot; asked Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,&quot; 
                and Dolokhov pressed Rostov's hand and burst into tears.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostov 
                that he was living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, 
                would not survive it. He implored Rostov to go on and prepare 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great 
                surprise learned that Dolokhov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, 
                lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and 
                was the most affectionate of sons and brothers. </p>

              <p> 　　At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, 
                having sent for Balashev and read him his letter to Napoleon, 
                ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. 
                When dispatching Balashev, the Emperor repeated to him the words 
                that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained 
                on Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon. 
                Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because 
                with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to 
                use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was 
                being made, but he definitely instructed Balashev to repeat them 
                personally to Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied 
                by a bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts 
                at the village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, 
                by dawn. There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.</p>
              <p> 　　A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform 
                and a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt. 
                Balashev did not do so at once, but continued to advance along 
                the road at a walking pace.</p>
              <p> 　　The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of 
                abuse, advanced his horse's chest against Balashev, put his hand 
                to his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: 
                was he deaf that he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned 
                who he was. The noncommissioned officer began talking with his 
                comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian 
                general.</p>
              <p> 　　After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, 
                after conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, 
                and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank 
                in the service, Balashev found it very strange here on Russian 
                soil to encounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, 
                application of brute force to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the 
                air was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along 
                the road from the village, and over the fields the larks rose 
                trilling, one after another, like bubbles rising in water.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer 
                from the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French 
                hussars looked silently at one another from time to time.</p>
              <p> 　　A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his 
                bed, came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, 
                accompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their 
                horses all looked smart and well kept.</p>
              <p> 　　It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still 
                in full trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with 
                a shade of martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the 
                gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening 
                of a campaign.</p>
              <p> 　　The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was 
                polite and evidently understood Balashev's importance. He led 
                him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that 
                his wish to be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied 
                immediately, as the Emperor's quarters were, he believed, not 
                far off.</p>
              <p> 　　They rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French 
                hussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel 
                and stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at 
                the other end of the village. The colonel said that the commander 
                of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive 
                Balashev and conduct him to his destination.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.</p>
              <p> 　　They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they 
                saw a group of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, 
                on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode 
                a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down 
                to his shoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long 
                legs forward in French fashion. This man rode toward Balashev 
                at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering 
                in the bright June sunshine.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev was only two horses' length from the equestrian with 
                the bracelets, plunies, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was 
                galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when 
                Julner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: &quot;The 
                King of Naples!&quot; It was, in fact, Murat, now called &quot;King 
                of Naples.&quot; Though it was quite incomprehensible why he should 
                be King of Naples, he was called so, and was himself convinced 
                that he was so, and therefore assumed a more solemn and important 
                air than formerly. He was so sure that he really was the King 
                of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that city, 
                while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians 
                called out to him: &quot;Viva il re!&quot;* he turned to his wife 
                with a pensive smile and said: &quot;Poor fellows, they don't 
                know that I am leaving them tomorrow!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Long live the king.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples 
                and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, 
                after he had been ordered to return to military service- and especially 
                since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august 
                brother-in-law had told him: &quot;I made you King that you should 
                reign in my way, but not in yours!&quot;- he had cheerfully taken 
                up his familiar business, and- like a well-fed but not overfat 
                horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between 
                the shafts- he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive 
                as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads 
                of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.</p>
              <p> 　　On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with 
                its long hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal 
                manner, and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel 
                respectfully informed His Majesty of Balashev's mission, whose 
                name he could not pronounce.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;De Bal-macheve!&quot; said the King (overcoming by his 
                assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). 
                &quot;Charmed to make your acquaintance, General!&quot; he added, 
                with a gesture of kingly condescension.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal 
                dignity instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed 
                into his natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his 
                hand on the withers of Balashev's horse and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, General, it all looks like war,&quot; as if regretting 
                a circumstance of which he was unable to judge.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; replied Balashev, &quot;my master, 
                the Emperor, does not desire war and as Your Majesty sees...&quot; 
                said Balashev, using the words Your Majesty at every opportunity, 
                with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one 
                to whom the title was still a novelty.</p>
              <p> 　　Murat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened 
                to &quot;Monsieur de Bal-macheve.&quot; But royaute oblige!* and 
                he felt it incumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer 
                on state affairs with Alexander's envoy. He dismounted, took Balashev's 
                arm, and moving a few steps away from his suite, which waited 
                respectfully, began to pace up and down with him, trying to speak 
                significantly. He referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon 
                had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from 
                Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known and 
                the dignity of France was thereby offended. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Royalty has its obligations.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand, 
                because...&quot; but Murat interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then you don't consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?&quot; 
                he asked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator 
                of the war.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, my dear general!&quot; Murat again interrupted him, 
                &quot;with all my heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair 
                between them, and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish 
                as quickly as possible!&quot; said he, in the tone of a servant 
                who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel 
                between their masters.</p>
              <p> 　　And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state 
                of his health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times 
                he had spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering 
                his royal dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the 
                pose in which he had stood at his coronation. and, waving his 
                right arm, said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I won't detain you longer, General. I wish success to 
                your mission,&quot; and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing 
                feathers, and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite 
                who were respectfully awaiting him.</p>
              <p> 　　Balashev rode on, supposing from Murat's words that he would 
                very soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, 
                at the next village the sentinels of Davout's infantry corps detained 
                him as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of 
                the corps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village 
                to Marshal Davout. </p>

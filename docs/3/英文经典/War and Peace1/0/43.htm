              <p> 　　Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, 
                who had persisted in his request to Kutuzov, arrived at Grunth 
                and reported himself to Bagration. Bonaparte's adjutant had not 
                yet reached Murat's detachment and the battle had not yet begun. 
                In Bagration's detachment no one knew anything of the general 
                position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe 
                in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved 
                in the nearness of an engagement. Bagration, knowing Bolkonski 
                to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction 
                and special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would 
                probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving him 
                full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the 
                rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, &quot;which 
                is also very important.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;However, there will hardly be an engagement today,&quot; 
                said Bagration as if to reassure Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent 
                to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, 
                but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... he'll be of use here 
                if he's a brave officer,&quot; thought Bagration. Prince Andrew, 
                without replying, asked the prince's permission to ride round 
                the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know 
                his bearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer 
                on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring 
                on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke 
                it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces 
                who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, 
                benches, and fencing from the village.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, Prince! We can't stop those fellows,&quot; 
                said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers. &quot;The officers 
                don't keep them in hand. And there,&quot; he pointed to a sutler's 
                tent, &quot;they crowd in and sit. This morning I turned them 
                all out and now look, it's full again. I must go there, Prince, 
                and scare them a bit. It won't take a moment.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll and some 
                cheese,&quot; said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat 
                anything.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why didn't you mention it, Prince? I would have offered 
                you something.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with 
                flushed and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and 
                drinking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now what does this mean, gentlemen?&quot; said the staff 
                officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the 
                same thing more than once. &quot;You know it won't do to leave 
                your posts like this. The prince gave orders that no one should 
                leave his post. Now you, Captain,&quot; and he turned to a thin, 
                dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given 
                them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose 
                when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin?&quot; 
                he continued. &quot;One would think that as an artillery officer 
                you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! 
                The alarm will be sounded and you'll be in a pretty position without 
                your boots!&quot; (The staff officer smiled.) &quot;Kindly return 
                to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!&quot; he added in a 
                tone of command.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery 
                officer Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged 
                foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, 
                kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,&quot; 
                said Captain Tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, 
                evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished 
                he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He 
                grew confused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Kindly return to your posts,&quot; said the staff officer 
                trying to preserve his gravity.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small 
                figure. There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, 
                rather comic, but extremely attractive.</p>
              <p> 　　The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and 
                rode on.</p>
              <p> 　　Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and 
                overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw 
                on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly 
                dug clay of which showed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, 
                in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these 
                earthworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of red clay were 
                continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands. 
                Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment, 
                and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens of 
                soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment. 
                They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to 
                escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Voila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince,&quot;* 
                said the staff officer. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could 
                already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the 
                position.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's our battery,&quot; said the staff officer indicating 
                the highest point. &quot;It's in charge of the queer fellow we 
                saw without his boots. You can see everything from there; let's 
                go there, Prince.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you very much, I will go on alone,&quot; said 
                Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of this staff officer's 
                company, &quot;please don't trouble yourself further.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on 
                alone.</p>
              <p> 　　The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more 
                orderly and cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and 
                depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning 
                on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French. At Grunth 
                also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer 
                Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was 
                the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their greatcoats 
                were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers 
                were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in 
                the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered 
                over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were 
                building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the 
                fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and 
                leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the 
                boilers and porridge cookers. In one company dinner was ready, 
                and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting 
                till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in 
                a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, 
                had been tasted.</p>
              <p> 　　Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had 
                vodka, crowded round a pock-marked, broad-shouldered sergeant 
                major who, tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen 
                lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to 
                their lips with reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka 
                in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with 
                brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on 
                the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene 
                as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, 
                and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at 
                least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a 
                chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers- fine 
                fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs- near the shelter of 
                the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, 
                Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before 
                whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while two others were 
                flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare 
                back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was pacing up 
                and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must 
                be honest, honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there 
                is no honor in him, he's a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but 
                unnatural screams, continued.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go on, go on!&quot; said the major.</p>
              <p> 　　A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on 
                his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly 
                at the adjutant as he rode by.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. 
                Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right 
                and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of 
                truce had passed that morning, the lines were so near together 
                that the men could see one another's faces and speak to one another. 
                Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, 
                there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared 
                at their strange foreign enemies.</p>
              <p> 　　Since early morning- despite an injunction not to approach 
                the picket line- the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers 
                away. The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting 
                a curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention 
                to the sight-seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince 
                Andrew halted to have a look at the French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look! Look there!&quot; one soldier was saying to another, 
                pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket 
                line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to 
                a French grenadier. &quot;Hark to him jabbering! Fine, isn't it? 
                It's all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him. There now, Sidorov!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wait a bit and listen. It's fine!&quot; answered Sidorov, 
                who was considered an adept at French.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov. Prince 
                Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. 
                Dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was 
                stationed, with his captain.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, go on, go on!&quot; incited the officer, bending 
                forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was 
                incomprehensible to him. &quot;More, please: more! What's he saying?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into 
                a hot dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking 
                about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with 
                the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered 
                and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained that 
                the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive 
                you off,&quot; said Dolokhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!&quot; 
                said the French grenadier.</p>
              <p> 　　The French onlookers and listeners laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll make you dance as we did under Suvorov...,&quot;* 
                said Dolokhov. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;On vous fera danser.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Qu' est-ce qu'il chante?&quot;* asked a Frenchman. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;What's he singing about?&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's ancient history,&quot; said another, guessing that 
                it referred to a former war. &quot;The Emperor will teach your 
                Suvara as he has taught the others...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bonaparte...&quot; began Dolokhov, but the Frenchman 
                interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacre nom...!&quot; 
                cried he angrily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The devil skin your Emperor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldier's Russian and 
                shouldering his musket walked away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us go, Ivan Lukich,&quot; he said to the captain.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, that's the way to talk French,&quot; said the picket 
                soldiers. &quot;Now, Sidorov, you have a try!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sidorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber 
                meaningless sounds very fast: &quot;Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, 
                Kaska,&quot; he said, trying to give an expressive intonation 
                to his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!&quot; came peals 
                of such healthy and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that 
                it infected the French involuntarily, so much so that the only 
                thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, muskets, 
                explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses 
                and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered 
                cannon confronted one another as before. </p>

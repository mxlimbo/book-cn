              <p> 　　Countess Rostova, with her daughters and a large number of 
                guests, was already seated in the drawing room. The count took 
                the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection 
                of Turkish pipes. From time to time he went out to ask: &quot;Hasn't 
                she come yet?&quot; They were expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, 
                known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not 
                for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of 
                speech. Marya Dmitrievna was known to the Imperial family as well 
                as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, 
                laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about 
                her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they 
                talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about 
                the recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they 
                all knew it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two 
                guests who were smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, 
                but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched 
                the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation 
                of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.</p>
              <p> 　　One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin 
                and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed 
                like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on 
                the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece 
                far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing 
                up his eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the 
                countess', a man with &quot;a sharp tongue&quot; as they said 
                in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion. 
                The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably 
                washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of 
                his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting 
                it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant 
                Berg, an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom Boris was to 
                travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had, teased her 
                elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her &quot;intended.&quot; 
                The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite 
                occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond 
                of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting 
                two loquacious talkers at one another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich,&quot; 
                said Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary 
                Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases- which was 
                a peculiarity of his speech. &quot;Vous comptez vous faire des 
                rentes sur l'etat;* you want to make something out of your company?&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*You expect to make an income out of the government. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Peter Nikolaevich; I only want to show that in the 
                cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just 
                consider my own position now, Peter Nikolaevich...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. 
                His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would 
                remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that 
                had no direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours 
                without being at all put out of countenance himself or making 
                others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned 
                himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident 
                satisfaction.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the 
                cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four 
                months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive 
                two hundred and thirty,&quot; said he, looking at Shinshin and 
                the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious 
                to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone 
                else.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, by exchanging into 
                the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,&quot; continued 
                Berg, &quot;and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot 
                Guards. Then just think what can be done with two hundred and 
                thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send 
                something to my father,&quot; he went on, emitting a smoke ring.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;La balance y est...* A German knows how to skin a flint, 
                as the proverb says,&quot; remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe 
                to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count. </p>
              <p> 　　*So that squares matters. </p>
              <p> 　　The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that 
                Shinshin was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony 
                or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the 
                Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the 
                Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed 
                and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the 
                post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how 
                satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating 
                all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might 
                have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily sedate, 
                and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he 
                disarmed his hearers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go- foot 
                or horse- that I'll warrant,&quot; said Shinshin, patting him 
                on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.</p>
              <p> 　　Berg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went into 
                the drawing room. </p>
              <p> 　　It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled 
                guests, expecting the summons to zakuska,* avoid engaging in any 
                long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, 
                in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their 
                food. The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then 
                glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these 
                glances who, or what, they are waiting for- some important relation 
                who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready. </p>
              <p> 　　*Hors d'oeuvres. </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly 
                in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come 
                across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make 
                him talk, but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles 
                as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in 
                monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did 
                not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair 
                with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet 
                man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played 
                such a prank on a policeman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have only lately arrived?&quot; the countess asked 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oui, madame,&quot; replied he, looking around him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have not yet seen my husband?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Non, madame.&quot; He smiled quite inappropriately.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose 
                it's very interesting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very interesting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The 
                latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young 
                man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his 
                father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. 
                The other guests were all conversing with one another. &quot;The 
                Razumovskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess 
                Apraksina...&quot; was heard on all sides. The countess rose and 
                went into the ballroom.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Marya Dmitrievna?&quot; came her voice from there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Herself,&quot; came the answer in a rough voice, and 
                Marya Dmitrievna entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except 
                the very oldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door. Tall 
                and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray 
                curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged 
                her wide sleeves as if rolling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always 
                spoke in Russian.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping 
                and to her children,&quot; she said, in her loud, full-toned voice 
                which drowned all others. &quot;Well, you old sinner,&quot; she 
                went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, &quot;you're 
                feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? 
                But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings 
                are growing up,&quot; and she pointed to the girls. &quot;You 
                must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Well,&quot; said she, &quot;how's my Cossack?&quot; (Marya 
                Dmitrievna always called Natasha a Cossack) and she stroked the 
                child's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. 
                &quot;I know she's a scamp of a girl, but I like her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge 
                reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed 
                with the pleasure of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once 
                and addressed herself to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,&quot; said she, assuming 
                a soft high tone of voice. &quot;Come here, my friend...&quot; 
                and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, 
                looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only 
                one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in 
                your case it's my evident duty.&quot; She paused. All were silent, 
                expectant of what was to follow, for this was dearly only a prelude.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies 
                on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride 
                a bear! For shame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you went 
                to the war.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could 
                hardly keep from laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?&quot; said 
                Marya Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess 
                followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance 
                to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then 
                came Anna Mikhaylovna with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. 
                The smiling Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas. After them other 
                couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all 
                the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen 
                began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the 
                gallery, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the 
                strains of the count's household band were replaced by the clatter 
                of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps 
                of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with 
                Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left, 
                the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat 
                the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and 
                the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table 
                on one side sat the grownup young people: Vera beside Berg, and 
                Pierre beside Boris; and on the other side, the children, tutors, 
                and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases 
                the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its 
                light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors' glasses, 
                not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting 
                her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the 
                pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their 
                redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the 
                ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, 
                at the men's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially 
                that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, 
                ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern 
                to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vera 
                that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Boris was 
                telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging 
                glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little 
                but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups 
                he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without 
                omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler 
                thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind 
                the next man's shoulders and whispered: &quot;Dry Madeira&quot;... 
                &quot;Hungarian&quot;... or &quot;Rhine wine&quot; as the case 
                might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's 
                monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random 
                and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability 
                at the other guests. Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at 
                Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with 
                and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look 
                fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl's look made 
                him inclined to laugh without knowing why.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina, 
                to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. 
                Sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; 
                now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear 
                what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess 
                kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight 
                that might be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying 
                to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order 
                to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; 
                and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped

            <td> 　　Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests 
              began to take their leave.
              <p> 　　Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, 
                with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, to enter 
                a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to 
                say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides 
                this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead 
                of his own, the general's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling 
                at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his 
                absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in 
                it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. 
                Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness 
                that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: 
                &quot;I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change 
                your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again 
                everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, &quot;Opinions 
                are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow 
                I am.&quot; And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his 
                shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, 
                listened indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte 
                who had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close 
                to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through 
                his eyeglass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,&quot; said the 
                little princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. &quot;It is settled,&quot; 
                she added in a low voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the 
                match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess' 
                sister-in-law.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I rely on you, my dear,&quot; said Anna Pavlovna, also 
                in a low tone. &quot;Write to her and let me know how her father 
                looks at the matter. Au revoir!&quot;- and she left the hall.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending 
                his face close to her, began to whisper something.</p>
              <p> 　　Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl 
                and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened 
                to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an 
                air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess 
                as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's,&quot; 
                said Prince Hippolyte &quot;-so dull-. It has been a delightful 
                evening, has it not? Delightful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They say the ball will be very good,&quot; replied the 
                princess, drawing up her downy little lip. &quot;All the pretty 
                women in society will be there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not all, for you will not be there; not all,&quot; said 
                Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from 
                the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round 
                the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one 
                could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept 
                his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.</p>
              <p> 　　Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing 
                at her husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and 
                sleepy did he seem.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you ready?&quot; he asked his wife, looking past 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the 
                latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, 
                ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman 
                was helping into the carriage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Princesse, au revoir,&quot; cried he, stumbling with 
                his tongue as well as with his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in 
                the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince 
                Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Allow me, sir,&quot; said Prince Andrew in Russian in 
                a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking 
                his path.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am expecting you, Pierre,&quot; said the same voice, 
                but gently and affectionately.</p>
              <p> 　　The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince 
                Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting 
                for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, mon cher,&quot; said the vicomte, having seated 
                himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, &quot;your little princess 
                is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,&quot; and he kissed 
                the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent 
                airs,&quot; continued the vicomte. &quot;I pity the poor husband, 
                that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, &quot;And 
                you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? 
                One has to know how to deal with them.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's 
                study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down 
                on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his 
                hand (it was Caesar's Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, 
                began reading it in the middle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite 
                ill now,&quot; said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing 
                his small white hands.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted 
                his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the 
                thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is 
                possible but- I do not know how to express it... not by a balance 
                of political power....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such 
                abstract conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, 
                have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman 
                or a diplomatist?&quot; asked Prince Andrew after a momentary 
                silence.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one 
                or the other.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you must decide on something! Your father expects 
                it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe 
                as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned 
                to Moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young 
                man, &quot;Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. 
                I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and 
                here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in 
                everything.&quot; Pierre had already been choosing a career for 
                three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this 
                choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But he must be a Freemason,&quot; said he, referring 
                to the abbe whom he had met that evening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is all nonsense.&quot; Prince Andrew again interrupted 
                him, &quot;let us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking 
                and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If 
                it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be 
                the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against 
                the greatest man in the world is not right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish 
                words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply 
                to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to 
                give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this 
                naive question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If no one fought except on his own conviction, there 
                would be no wars,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And that would be splendid,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled ironically.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never 
                come about...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, why are you going to the war?&quot; asked Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going...&quot; 
                He paused. &quot;I am going because the life I am leading here 
                does not suit me!&quot; </p>

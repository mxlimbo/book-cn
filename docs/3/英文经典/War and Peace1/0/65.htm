              <p> 　　Kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace 
                behind the carabineers.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the 
                column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably 
                once been an inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill 
                and troops were marching along both.</p>
              <p> 　　The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly 
                visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down 
                below, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutuzov had 
                stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, 
                who was a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant 
                to ask him for a field glass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look, look!&quot; said this adjutant, looking not at 
                the troops in the distance, but down the hill before him. &quot;It's 
                the French!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, 
                trying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their 
                faces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed 
                to be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly 
                appeared just in front of us.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... 
                But how is that?&quot; said different voices.</p>
              <p> 　　With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, 
                not more than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing, 
                a dense French column coming up to meet the Apsherons.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn 
                has come,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse 
                he rode up to Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency,&quot; 
                cried he. But at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all 
                round, firing was heard quite close at hand, and a voice of naive 
                terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shouted, &quot;Brothers! 
                All's lost!&quot; And at this as if at a command, everyone began 
                to run.</p>
              <p> 　　Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where 
                five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only 
                would it have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible 
                not to be carried back with it oneself. Bolkonski only tried not 
                to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable 
                to grasp what was happening in front of him. Nesvitski with an 
                angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that 
                if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner. 
                Kutuzov remained in the same place and without answering drew 
                out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew 
                forced his way to him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are wounded?&quot; he asked, hardly able to master 
                the trembling of his lower jaw.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The wound is not here, it is there!&quot; said Kutuzov, 
                pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to 
                the fleeing soldiers. &quot;Stop them!&quot; he shouted, and at 
                the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to 
                stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back 
                with it.</p>
              <p> 　　The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded 
                by them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, &quot;Get 
                on! Why are you hindering us?&quot; Another in the same place 
                turned round and fired in the air; a third was striking the horse 
                Kutuzov himself rode. Having by a great effort got away to the 
                left from that flood of men, Kutuzov, with his suite diminished 
                by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery fire near 
                by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince 
                Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, saw on the slope of the hill 
                amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen 
                running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither 
                moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing 
                crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and 
                approached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov's suite only four remained. They 
                were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop those wretches!&quot; gasped Kutuzov to the regimental 
                commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, 
                as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across 
                the regiment and across Kutuzov's suite like a flock of little 
                birds.</p>
              <p> 　　The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were 
                firing at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched 
                at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who 
                was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and 
                fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers 
                started firing without orders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked 
                around.... &quot;Bolkonski!&quot; he whispered, his voice trembling 
                from a consciousness of the feebleness of age, &quot;Bolkonski!&quot; 
                he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at the 
                enemy, &quot;what's that?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling 
                tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his 
                horse and run to the standard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forward, lads!&quot; he shouted in a voice piercing 
                as a child's.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here it is!&quot; thought he, seizing the staff of the 
                standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently 
                aimed at him. Several soldiers fell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah!&quot; shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able 
                to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence 
                that the whole battalion would follow him.</p>
              <p> 　　And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved 
                and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting 
                &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion 
                ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince 
                Andrew's hands, but he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again 
                seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with 
                the battalion. In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom 
                were fighting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were 
                running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were 
                seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince 
                Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the 
                cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly 
                and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and 
                dropped. But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was 
                going on in front of him- at the battery. He now saw clearly the 
                figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling 
                one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other. He 
                could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the 
                faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they 
                were doing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are they about?&quot; thought Prince Andrew as 
                he gazed at them. &quot;Why doesn't the red-haired gunner run 
                away as he is unarmed? Why doesn't the Frenchman stab him? He 
                will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and 
                stabs him....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran 
                up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, 
                who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize 
                what awaited him, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did 
                not see how it ended. It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers 
                near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. 
                It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted 
                him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,&quot; 
                thought he, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to 
                see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, 
                whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether 
                the cannon had been captured or saved. But he saw nothing. Above 
                him there was now nothing but the sky- the lofty sky, not clear 
                yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly 
                across it. &quot;How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as 
                I ran,&quot; thought Prince Andrew- &quot;not as we ran, shouting 
                and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with 
                frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently 
                do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was 
                it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to 
                have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except 
                that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even 
                it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank 
                God!...&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our 
                right flank. In the center Tushin's forgotten battery, which had 
                managed to set fire to the Schon Grabern village, delayed the 
                French advance. The French were putting out the fire which the 
                wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement 
                of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the 
                rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not 
                get mixed. But our left- which consisted of the Azov and Podolsk 
                infantry and the Pavlograd hussars- was simultaneously attacked 
                and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was 
                thrown into confusion. Bagration had sent Zherkov to the general 
                commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.</p>
              <p> 　　Zherkov, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse 
                about and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagration than 
                his courage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go 
                where it was dangerous.</p>
              <p> 　　Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front 
                where the firing was, he began to look for the general and his 
                staff where they could not possibly be, and so did not deliver 
                the order.</p>
              <p> 　　The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the 
                commander of the regiment Kutuzov had reviewed at Braunau and 
                in which Dolokhov was serving as a private. But the command of 
                the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the 
                Pavlograd regiment in which Rostov was serving, and a misunderstanding 
                arose. The two commanders were much exasperated with one another 
                and, long after the action had begun on the right flank and the 
                French were already advancing, were engaged in discussion with 
                the sole object of offending one another. But the regiments, both 
                cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the impending 
                action. From privates to general they were not expecting a battle 
                and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding 
                the horses and the infantry collecting wood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He higher iss dan I in rank,&quot; said the German colonel 
                of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden 
                up, &quot;so let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my 
                hussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling 
                together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the 
                capotes of Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the 
                milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. 
                The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with 
                jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight 
                and tall and rode to the Pavlograd commander. The commanders met 
                with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Once again, Colonel,&quot; said the general, &quot;I 
                can't leave half my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,&quot; 
                he repeated, &quot;to occupy the position and prepare for an attack.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your 
                business!&quot; suddenly replied the irate colonel. &quot;If you 
                vere in the cavalry...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian 
                general and if you are not aware of the fact...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quite avare, your excellency,&quot; suddenly shouted 
                the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face. 
                &quot;Vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis 
                position iss no goot? I don't vish to destroy my men for your 
                pleasure!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my 
                own pleasure and I won't allow it to be said!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage, 
                the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him 
                to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there 
                amongst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped 
                over them, and they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh 
                to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before 
                it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act 
                among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French 
                were outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked sternly 
                and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing 
                for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in 
                the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As there 
                was nothing to said, and neither wished to give occasion for it 
                to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of 
                fire, they would have remained there for a long time testing each 
                other's courage had it not been that just then they heard the 
                rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the 
                wood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. 
                It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the 
                infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left 
                by the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary 
                to attack in order to cut away through for themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　The squadron in which Rostov was serving had scarcely time 
                to mount before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the 
                Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, 
                and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear- 
                resembling the line separating the living from the dead- lay between 
                them. All were conscious of this unseen line, and the question 
                whether they would they would cross it or not, and how they would 
                cross it, agitated them all.</p>
              <p> 　　The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to 
                questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately 
                insisting on having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything 
                definite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron. 
                The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they 
                were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The troops 
                of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander 
                did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated 
                itself to the men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If only they would be quick!&quot; thought Rostov, feeling 
                that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack 
                of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fo'ward, with God, lads!&quot; rang out Denisov's voice. 
                &quot;At a twot fo'ward!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The horses' croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled 
                at the reins and started of his own accord.</p>
              <p> 　　Before him, on the right, Rostov saw the front lines of his 
                hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not 
                see distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, 
                but some way off.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Faster!&quot; came the word of command, and Rostov felt 
                Rook's flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov anticipated his horse's movements and became more and 
                more elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This 
                tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible- 
                and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing 
                terrible, but everything was becoming more and more happy and 
                animated. &quot;Oh, how I will slash at him!&quot; thought Rostov, 
                gripping the hilt of his saber.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hur-a-a-a-ah!&quot; came a roar of voices. &quot;Let 
                anyone come my way now,&quot; thought Rostov driving his spurs 
                into Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped 
                the others. Ahead, the enemy was already visible. Suddenly something 
                like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rostov raised 
                his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko, 
                who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostov felt as 
                in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural 
                speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him Bondarchuk, 
                an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at him. 
                Bondarchuk's horse swerved and galloped past.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!&quot; 
                Rostov asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in 
                the middle of a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars' 
                backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and 
                the stubble around him. There was warm blood under his arm. &quot;No, 
                I am wounded and the horse is killed.&quot; Rook tried to rise 
                on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider's leg. Blood 
                was flowing from his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostov 
                also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become 
                entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the French, 
                he did not know. There was no one near.</p>
              <p> 　　Having disentangled his leg, he rose. &quot;Where, on which 
                side, was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?&quot; 
                he asked himself and could not answer. &quot;Can something bad 
                have happened to me?&quot; he wondered as he got up: and at that 
                moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed 
                left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He examined his 
                hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. &quot;Ah, here 
                are people coming,&quot; he thought joyfully, seeing some men 
                running toward him. &quot;They will help me!&quot; In front came 
                a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, 
                and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running 
                behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In 
                among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian 
                hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was being 
                led behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that 
                they will take me too? Who are these men?&quot; thought Rostov, 
                scarcely believing his eyes. &quot;Can they be French?&quot; He 
                looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before 
                he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, 
                their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe 
                his eyes. &quot;Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be 
                coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond 
                of?&quot; He remembered his mother's love for him, and his family's, 
                and his friends', and the enemy's intention to kill him seemed 
                impossible. &quot;But perhaps they may do it!&quot; For more than 
                ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the 
                situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, 
                was already so close that the expression of his face could be 
                seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging 
                down, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. 
                He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the 
                Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes. He did 
                not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which 
                he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare 
                fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that of fear for 
                his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping 
                the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he 
                used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, 
                pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through 
                him: &quot;No, better not look,&quot; he thought, but having reached 
                the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, 
                and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a 
                walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther 
                back. Rostov paused. &quot;No, there's some mistake,&quot; thought 
                he. &quot;They can't have wanted to kill me.&quot; But at the 
                same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight 
                were tied to it. He could run no more. The Frenchman also stopped 
                and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet 
                and then another whistled past him. He mustered his last remaining 
                strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and reached 
                the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.</p>

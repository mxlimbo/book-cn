              <p> 　　Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for 
                the wolf. By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries 
                of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices 
                of the huntsmen approached, receded, and rose, he realized what 
                was happening at the copse. He knew that young and old wolves 
                were there, that the hounds had separated into two packs, that 
                somewhere a wolf was being chased, and that something had gone 
                wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any moment. He made 
                thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side 
                the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated 
                with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God that 
                the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and 
                shame-faced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement 
                arising from trivial causes. &quot;What would it be to Thee to 
                do this for me?&quot; he said to God. &quot;I know Thou art great, 
                and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee, but for God's sake do 
                let the old wolf come my way and let Karay spring at it- in sight 
                of 'Uncle' who is watching from over there- and seize it by the 
                throat in a death grip!&quot; A thousand times during that half-hour 
                Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of the wood, 
                with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and 
                the gully with its water-worn side and &quot;Uncle's&quot; cap 
                just visible above the bush on his right.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I shan't have such luck,&quot; thought Rostov, &quot;yet 
                what wouldn't it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards 
                and in war, I am always unlucky.&quot; Memories of Austerlitz 
                and of Dolokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. 
                &quot;Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I want only that!&quot; 
                thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and 
                then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of 
                note in the cries of the dogs.</p>
              <p> 　　Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward 
                him across the deserted field. &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; thought 
                Rostov, taking a deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something 
                long hoped for. The height of happiness was reached- and so simply, 
                without warning, or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe 
                his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran 
                forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. 
                She was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly. 
                She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw 
                her. Rostov, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois. 
                They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation. 
                Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, 
                baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ulyulyulyu!&quot; whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. 
                The borzois jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking 
                their ears. Karay finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking 
                his ears, got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted 
                hair hung down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall I loose them or not?&quot; Nicholas asked himself 
                as the wolf approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the 
                wolf's whole physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she 
                had probably never seen before- human eyes fixed upon her- and 
                turning her head a little toward Rostov, she paused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...&quot; the 
                wolf seemed to say to herself, and she moved forward without again 
                looking round and with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ulyulyu!&quot; cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, 
                and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, 
                leaping over gullies to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed 
                it, running faster still. Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor 
                feel that he was galloping, nor see the borzois, nor the ground 
                over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who, increasing her 
                speed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow. The 
                first to come into view was Milka, with her black markings and 
                powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer... 
                now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face 
                her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did Milka 
                suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ulyulyulyulyu!&quot; shouted Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang 
                impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but 
                immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed 
                her teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the 
                distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get 
                any closer to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She'll get away! No, it's impossible!&quot; thought 
                Nicholas, still shouting with a hoarse voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Karay, ulyulyu!...&quot; he shouted, looking round for 
                the old borzoi who was now his only hope. Karay, with all the 
                strength age had left him, stretched himself to the utmost and, 
                watching the wolf, galloped heavily aside to intercept it. But 
                the quickness of the wolf's lope and the borzoi's slower pace 
                made it plain that Karay had miscalculated. Nicholas could already 
                see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly 
                escape should she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds 
                and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf. There was 
                still hope. A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did not 
                know, from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from 
                in front and almost knocked her over. But the wolf jumped up more 
                quickly than anyone could have expected and, gnashing her teeth, 
                flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing yelp, fell 
                with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its side.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Karay? Old fellow!...&quot; wailed Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's 
                path, the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh 
                was within five paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf 
                turned her eyes on Karay, tucked her tail yet further between 
                her legs, and increased her speed. But here Nicholas only saw 
                that something happened to Karay- the borzoi was suddenly on the 
                wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in front 
                of them.</p>
              <p> 　　That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the 
                gully with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray 
                hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, 
                with her ears laid back (Karay was pinning her by the throat), 
                was the happiest moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, 
                he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly 
                thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs, and then her 
                forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She clicked her teeth 
                (Karay no longer had her by the throat), leaped with a movement 
                of her hind legs out of the gully, and having disengaged herself 
                from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went forward. Karay, 
                his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded, climbed with 
                difficulty out of the gully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh my God! Why?&quot; Nicholas cried in despair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle's&quot; huntsman was galloping from the other 
                side across the wolf's path and his borzois once more stopped 
                the animal's advance. She was again hemmed in.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas and his attendant, with &quot;Uncle&quot; and his 
                huntsman, were all riding round the wolf, crying &quot;ulyulyu!&quot; 
                shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched 
                back, and starting forward again every time she shook herself 
                and moved toward the wood where she would be safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the 
                ulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karay seize the 
                wolf, and checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over. 
                But when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the 
                wolf shook herself and ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut 
                galloping, not at the wolf but straight toward the wood, just 
                as Karay had run to cut the animal off. As a result of this, he 
                galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second 
                time by &quot;Uncle's&quot; borzois.</p>
              <p> 　　Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his 
                left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse 
                with his whip as if it were a flail.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, 
                breathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a 
                body and saw Daniel lying on the wolf's back among the dogs, trying 
                to seize her by the ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, 
                and to the wolf herself that all was now over. The terrified wolf 
                pressed back her ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck 
                to her. Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole 
                weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her 
                by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, 
                &quot;Don't! We'll gag her!&quot; and, changing his position, 
                set his foot on the wolf's neck. A stick was thrust between her 
                jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs 
                were bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice 
                from side to side.</p>
              <p> 　　With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, 
                on a shying and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping 
                at her, took her to the place where they were all to meet. The 
                hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen 
                assembled with their booty and their stories, and all came to 
                look at the wolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down 
                and the bitten stick between her jaws, gazed with great glassy 
                eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding her. When she was 
                touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply 
                at everybody. Old Count Rostov also rode up and touched the wolf.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what a formidable one!&quot; said he. &quot;A formidable 
                one, eh?&quot; he asked Daniel, who was standing near.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your excellency,&quot; answered Daniel, quickly 
                doffing his cap.</p>
              <p> 　　The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter 
                with Daniel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!&quot; said 
                the count.</p>
              <p> 　　For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and 
                amiable smile. </p>

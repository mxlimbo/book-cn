              <p> 　　The duel between Pierre and Dolokhov was hushed up and, in 
                spite of the Emperor's severity regarding duels at that time, 
                neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But 
                the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre's rupture with his 
                wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with 
                patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and 
                petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had 
                sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage- when 
                the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope 
                from him- especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, 
                to court society's favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had 
                happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like 
                his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre's 
                departure Helene returned to Petersburg, she was received by all 
                her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of 
                deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her 
                husband Helene assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic 
                tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance. 
                This expression suggested that she had resolved to endure her 
                troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid 
                upon her by God. Prince Vasili expressed his opinion more openly. 
                He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing 
                to his forehead, remarked:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A bit touched- I always said so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I said from the first,&quot; declared Anna Pavlovna 
                referring to Pierre, &quot;I said at the time and before anyone 
                else&quot; (she insisted on her priority) &quot;that that senseless 
                young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days. I said 
                so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him, 
                when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, 
                he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has 
                it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all 
                that has happened.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same 
                kind of soirees as before- such as she alone had the gift of arranging- 
                at which was to be found &quot;the cream of really good society, 
                the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,&quot; as 
                she herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society 
                Anna Pavlovna's receptions were also distinguished by the fact 
                that she always presented some new and interesting person to the 
                visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political 
                thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and 
                distinctly indicated.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon's 
                destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the 
                surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, 
                when our troops had already entered Prussia and our second war 
                with Napoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of her soirees. 
                The &quot;cream of really good society&quot; consisted of the 
                fascinating Helene, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful 
                Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, 
                the old aunt, a young man referred to in that drawing room as 
                &quot;a man of great merit&quot; (un homme de beaucoup de merite), 
                a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other 
                less noteworthy persons.</p>
              <p> 　　The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that 
                evening was Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special 
                messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very 
                important personage.</p>
              <p> 　　The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the 
                company that evening was this:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may 
                do to countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, 
                annoyance and mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. 
                We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject, 
                and can only say to the King Prussia and others: 'So much the 
                worse for you. Tu l'as voulu, George Dandin,' that's all we have 
                to say about it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When Boris, who was to be served up to the guests, entered 
                the drawing room, almost all the company had assembled, and the 
                conversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, was about our diplomatic 
                relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed, 
                entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an 
                aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the 
                aunt and then brought back to the general circle.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced 
                him to several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered 
                description of each. charge d'affaires from Copenhagen- a profound 
                intellect,&quot; and simply, &quot;Mr. Shitov- a man of great 
                merit&quot;- this of the man usually so described.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to Anna Mikhaylovna's efforts, his own tastes, and 
                the peculiarities of his reserved nature, Boris had managed during 
                his service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp 
                to a very important personage, had been sent on a very important 
                mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special 
                messenger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten 
                code with which he had been so pleased at Olmutz and according 
                to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general, 
                and according to which what was needed for success in the service 
                was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only 
                the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, 
                and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success 
                and at the inability of others to understand these things. In 
                consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his 
                relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were 
                completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last 
                groat to be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive 
                himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby 
                equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. 
                He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those 
                above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. 
                He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the 
                Rostovs' house and of his childish love for Natasha was unpleasant 
                to him and he had not once been to see the Rostovs since the day 
                of his departure for the army. To be in Anna Pavlovna's drawing 
                room he considered an important step up in the service, and he 
                at once understood his role, letting his hostess make use of whatever 
                interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face, 
                appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each 
                of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took 
                the seat indicated to him beside the fair Helene and listened 
                to the general conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so 
                unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes 
                would secure them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining 
                them. That is the actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,&quot; 
                said the Danish charge d'affaires.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The doubt is flattering,&quot; said &quot;the man of 
                profound intellect,&quot; with a subtle smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the 
                Emperor of Austria,&quot; said Mortemart. &quot;The Emperor of 
                Austria can never have thought of such a thing, it is only the 
                cabinet that says it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear vicomte,&quot; put in Anna Pavlovna, &quot;L'Urope&quot; 
                (for some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially 
                refined French pronunciation which she could allow herself when 
                conversing with a Frenchman), &quot;L'Urope ne sera jamais notre 
                alliee sincere.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Europe will never be our sincere ally.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　After that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness 
                of the King of Prussia, in order to draw Boris into the conversation.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting 
                his turn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his 
                neighbor, the beautiful Helene, whose eyes several times met those 
                of the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna very naturally 
                asked Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what 
                state he found the Prussian army. Boris, speaking with deliberation, 
                told them in pure, correct French many interesting details about 
                the armies and the court, carefully abstaining from expressing 
                an opinion of his own about the facts he was recounting. For some 
                time he engrossed the general attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt 
                that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure 
                by all her visitors. The greatest attention of all to Boris' narrative 
                was shown by Helene. She asked him several questions about his 
                journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian 
                army. As soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You absolutely must come and see me,&quot; she said 
                in a tone that implied that, for certain considerations he could 
                not know of, this was absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great 
                pleasure.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin 
                a conversation with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on 
                the pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know her husband, of course?&quot; said Anna Pavlovna, 
                closing her eyes and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture. 
                &quot;Ah, she is such an unfortunate and charming woman! Don't 
                mention him before her- please don't! It is too painful for her!&quot;

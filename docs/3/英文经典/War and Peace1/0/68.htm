              <p> 　　On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff 
                in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and 
                unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.</p>
              <p> 　　Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He 
                did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he 
                again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating 
                pain in his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till 
                now, but saw today?&quot; was his first thought. &quot;And I did 
                not know this suffering either,&quot; he thought. &quot;Yes, I 
                did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am 
                I?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and 
                voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was 
                the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating 
                still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not 
                turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound 
                of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte 
                riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen 
                the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the 
                killed and wounded left on the field.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fine men!&quot; remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead 
                Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and 
                a blackened nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened 
                arm flung wide.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, 
                Your Majesty,&quot; said an adjutant who had come from the batteries 
                that were firing at Augesd.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have some brought from the reserve,&quot; said Napoleon, 
                and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, 
                who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside 
                him. (The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's a fine death!&quot; said Napoleon as he gazed 
                at Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that 
                it was Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as 
                Sire. But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing 
                of a fly. Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice 
                of them and at once forgot them. His head was burning, he felt 
                himself bleeding to death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, 
                and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleon- his hero- but at 
                that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant 
                creature compared with what was passing now between himself and 
                that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that 
                moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, 
                or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing 
                near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him 
                back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had 
                today learned to understand it so differently. He collected all 
                his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg 
                and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! He is alive,&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;Lift this 
                young man up and carry him to the dressing station.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, 
                who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate 
                him on the victory.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness 
                from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the 
                jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the 
                dressing station. He did not regain consciousness till late in 
                the day, when with other wounded and captured Russian officers 
                he was carried to the hospital. During this transfer he felt a 
                little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.</p>
              <p> 　　The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those 
                of a French convoy officer, who said rapidly: &quot;We must halt 
                here: the Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him 
                to see these gentlemen prisoners.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole 
                Russian army, that he is probably tired of them,&quot; said another 
                officer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All the same! They say this one is the commander of 
                all the Emperor Alexander's Guards,&quot; said the first one, 
                indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse 
                Guards.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg 
                society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer 
                of the Horse Guards.</p>
              <p> 　　Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which is the senior?&quot; he asked, on seeing the prisoners.</p>
              <p> 　　They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander's regiment 
                of Horse Guards?&quot; asked Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I commanded a squadron,&quot; replied Repnin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,&quot; said 
                Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest 
                reward,&quot; said Repnin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I bestow it with pleasure,&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;And 
                who is that young man beside you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.</p>
              <p> 　　After looking at him Napoleon smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's very young to come to meddle with us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Youth is no hindrance to courage,&quot; muttered Sukhtelen 
                in a failing voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A splendid reply!&quot; said Napoleon. &quot;Young man, 
                you will go far!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the 
                Emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail 
                to attract his attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing 
                him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet 
                &quot;young man&quot; that was connected in his memory with Prince 
                Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and you, young man,&quot; said he. &quot;How do 
                you feel, mon brave?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to 
                say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with 
                his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant 
                at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed 
                Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity 
                and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and 
                kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not 
                answer him.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison 
                with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from 
                loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in 
                him. Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the 
                insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no 
                one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, 
                the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and 
                said to one of the officers as he went: &quot;Have these gentlemen 
                attended to and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine 
                their wounds. Au revoir, Prince Repnin!&quot; and he spurred his 
                horse and galloped away.</p>
              <p> 　　His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and 
                taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's 
                neck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they 
                now hastened to return the holy image.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, 
                but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared 
                upon his chest outside his uniform.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It would be good,&quot; thought Prince Andrew, glancing 
                at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion 
                and reverence, &quot;it would be good if everything were as clear 
                and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it would be to know where 
                to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond 
                the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say: 
                'Lord, have mercy on me!'... But to whom should I say that? Either 
                to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot 
                address but which I cannot even express in words- the Great All 
                or Nothing-&quot; said he to himself, &quot;or to that God who 
                has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, 
                nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, 
                and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.</p>
              <p> 　　The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable 
                pain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions 
                of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness 
                he had felt the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant 
                little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the 
                chief subjects of his delirious fancies.</p>
              <p> 　　The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented 
                itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that 
                little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing 
                look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts 
                and torments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. 
                Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos 
                and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion 
                of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death 
                than in convalescence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a nervous, bilious subject,&quot; said Larrey, 
                &quot;and will not recover.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to 
                the care of the inhabitants of the district. </p>

          <tr> 
            <td>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if 
                I am not mistaken,&quot; said the stranger in a deliberate and 
                loud voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have heard of you, my dear sir, &quot;continued the 
                stranger, &quot;and of your misfortune.&quot; He seemed to emphasize 
                the last word, as if to say- &quot;Yes, misfortune! Call it what 
                you please, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.&quot;- 
                &quot;I regret it very much, my dear sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the 
                bed, bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear 
                sir, but for greater reasons.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the 
                sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre 
                felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but, 
                submitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are unhappy, my dear sir,&quot; the stranger continued. 
                &quot;You are young and I am old. I should like to help you as 
                far as lies in my power.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Pierre, with a forced smile. &quot;I 
                am very grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger's face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, 
                but in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance 
                were irresistibly attractive to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But if for reason you don't feel inclined to talk to 
                me,&quot; said the old man, &quot;say so, my dear sir.&quot; And 
                he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to 
                make your acquaintance,&quot; said Pierre. And again, glancing 
                at the stranger's hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with 
                its skull- a Masonic sign.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Allow me to ask,&quot; he said, &quot;are you a Mason?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,&quot; 
                said the stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre's eyes. 
                &quot;And in their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand 
                to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am afraid,&quot; said Pierre, smiling, and wavering 
                between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired 
                in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs- &quot;I 
                am afraid I am very far from understanding- how am I to put it?- 
                I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours 
                that we shall not understand one another.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know your outlook,&quot; said the Mason, &quot;and 
                the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result 
                of your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of 
                people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance. 
                Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I had not known it I should not 
                have addressed you. Your view of life is a regrettable delusion.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,&quot; said 
                Pierre, with a faint smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should never dare to say that I know the truth,&quot; 
                said the Mason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by their 
                precision and firmness. &quot;No one can attain to truth by himself. 
                Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all, by 
                the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own 
                times, is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling 
                place of the Great God,&quot; he added, and closed his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not 
                believe in God, said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling 
                it essential to speak the whole truth.</p>
              <p> 　　The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man 
                with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him 
                that he, poor man, had not the five rubles that would make him 
                happy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,&quot; said the 
                Mason. &quot;You cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that 
                is why you are unhappy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, I am unhappy,&quot; assented Pierre. &quot;But 
                what am I to do?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. 
                You do not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my 
                words, He is in thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou 
                hast just uttered!&quot; pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If He were not,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;you and 
                I would not be speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, 
                are we speaking? Whom hast thou denied?&quot; he suddenly asked 
                with exulting austerity and authority in his voice. &quot;Who 
                invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy conception 
                of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst thou, 
                and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence 
                of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, 
                and infinite in all His attributes?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He stopped and remained silent for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He exists, but to understand Him is hard,&quot; the 
                Mason began again, looking not at Pierre but straight before him, 
                and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from 
                excitement he could not keep still. &quot;If it were a man whose 
                existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee, could take 
                him by the hand and show him to thee. But how can I, an insignificant 
                mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy 
                to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see 
                or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness 
                and sinfulness?&quot; He paused again. &quot;Who art thou? Thou 
                dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous 
                words,&quot; he went on, with a somber and scornful smile. &quot;And 
                thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child, who, 
                playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares to say 
                that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in 
                the master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from 
                our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to attain that knowledge 
                and are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of 
                understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason's 
                face with shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but 
                believing with his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether 
                he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason's words, 
                or believed as a child believes, in the speaker's tone of conviction 
                and earnestness, or the tremor of the speaker's voice- which sometimes 
                almost broke- or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, 
                or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated 
                from his whole being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast 
                with his own dejection and hopelessness)- at any rate, Pierre 
                longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe, and 
                felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and return to life.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,&quot; 
                said the Mason.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not understand,&quot; said Pierre, feeling with 
                dismay doubts reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, 
                any weakness, in the Mason's arguments; he dreaded not to be able 
                to believe in him. &quot;I don't understand,&quot; he said, &quot;how 
                it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of which 
                you speak.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid 
                we may wish to imbibe,&quot; he said. &quot;Can I receive that 
                pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity? Only 
                by the inner purification of myself can I retain in some degree 
                of purity the liquid I receive.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, that is so,&quot; said Pierre joyfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not 
                on those worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and 
                the like, into which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest 
                wisdom is one. The highest wisdom has but one science- the science 
                of the whole- the science explaining the whole creation and man's 
                place in it. To receive that science it is necessary to purify 
                and renew one's inner self, and so before one can know, it is 
                necessary to believe and to perfect one's self. And to attain 
                this end, we have the light called conscience that God has implanted 
                in our souls.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; assented Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, 
                and ask thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast 
                thou attained relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, 
                you are rich, you are clever, you are well educated. And what 
                have you done with all these good gifts? Are you content with 
                yourself and with your life?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I hate my life,&quot; Pierre muttered, wincing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and 
                as thou art purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, 
                my dear sir. How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, 
                receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return. 
                You have become the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? 
                What have you done for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of 
                your tens of thousands of slaves? Have you helped them physically 
                and morally? No! You have profited by their toil to lead a profligate 
                life. That is what you have done. Have you chosen a post in which 
                you might be of service to your neighbor? No! You have spent your 
                life in idleness. Then you married, my dear sir- took on yourself 
                responsibility for the guidance of a young woman; and what have 
                you done? You have not helped her to find the way of truth, my 
                dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and misery. 
                A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not know 
                God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear 
                sir!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, 
                again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. 
                Pierre looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless 
                face and moved his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to 
                say, &quot;Yes, a vile, idle, vicious life!&quot; but dared not 
                break the silence.</p>
              <p> 　　The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called 
                his servant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How about the horses?&quot; he asked, without looking 
                at Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The exchange horses have just come,&quot; answered the 
                servant. &quot;Will you not rest here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, tell them to harness.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can he really be going away leaving me alone without 
                having told me all, and without promising to help me?&quot; thought 
                Pierre, rising with downcast head; and he began to pace the room, 
                glancing occasionally at the Mason. &quot;Yes, I never thought 
                of it, but I have led a contemptible and profligate life, though 
                I did not like it and did not want to,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;But 
                this man knows the truth and, if he wished to, could disclose 
                it to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. 
                The traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, 
                began fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezukhov, 
                and said in a tone of indifferent politeness:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going to now, my dear sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I?... I'm going to Petersburg,&quot; answered Pierre, 
                in a childlike, hesitating voice. &quot;I thank you. I agree with 
                all you have said. But do not suppose me to be so bad. With my 
                whole soul I wish to be what you would have me be, but I have 
                never had help from anyone.... But it is I, above all, who am 
                to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and perhaps I may...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.</p>
              <p> 　　The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Help comes from God alone,&quot; he said, &quot;but 
                such measure of help as our Order can bestow it will render you, 
                my dear sir. You are going to Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski&quot; 
                (he took out his notebook and wrote a few words on a large sheet 
                of paper folded in four). &quot;Allow me to give you a piece of 
                advice. When you reach the capital, first of all devote some time 
                to solitude and self-examination and do not resume your former 
                way of life. And now I wish you a good journey, my dear sir,&quot; 
                he added, seeing that his servant had entered... &quot;and success.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw 
                from the postmaster's book. Bazdeev had been one of the best-known 
                Freemasons and Martinists, even in Novikov's time. For a long 
                while after he had gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses 
                but paced up and down the room, pondering over his vicious past, 
                and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself 
                the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him 
                so easy. It seemed to him that he had been vicious only because 
                he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a

                of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how 
                Freemasonry presented itself to him. </p>

              <p> 　　The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the 
                snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. From the far 
                side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult 
                passages- twenty times repeated- of a sonata by Dussek.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove 
                up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped 
                his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before 
                him. Old Tikhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of 
                the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, 
                and hastily closed the door. Tikhon knew that neither the son's 
                arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb 
                the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew 
                this as well as Tikhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain 
                whether his father's habits had changed since he was at home last, 
                and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his 
                wife.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to 
                Mary's room,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but 
                her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began 
                to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, this is a palace!&quot; she said to her husband, 
                looking around with the expression with which people compliment 
                their host at a ball. &quot;Let's come, quick, quick!&quot; And 
                with a glance round, she smiled at Tikhon, at her husband, and 
                at the footman who accompanied them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that Mary practicing? Let's go quietly and take her 
                by surprise.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You've grown older, Tikhon,&quot; he said in passing 
                to the old man, who kissed his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the 
                clavichord came, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! what joy for the princess!&quot; exclaimed she: 
                &quot;At last! I must let her know.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,&quot; 
                said the little princess, kissing her. &quot;I know you already 
                through my sister-in-law's friendship for you. She was not expecting 
                us?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came 
                the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew 
                stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off 
                in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread 
                and the sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, 
                who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, 
                were in each other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever 
                place they happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near 
                them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and 
                obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged 
                his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear 
                a false note. The two women let go of one another, and then, as 
                if afraid of being too late, seized each other's hands, kissing 
                them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other 
                on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise both began to 
                cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. 
                Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women 
                it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it 
                never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at 
                this meeting.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!&quot; they suddenly exclaimed, 
                and then laughed. &quot;I dreamed last night...&quot;- &quot;You 
                were not expecting us?...&quot;- &quot;Ah! Mary, you have got 
                thinner?...&quot; &quot;And you have grown stouter!...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I knew the princess at once,&quot; put in Mademoiselle 
                Bourienne.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I had no idea!...&quot; exclaimed Princess Mary. 
                &quot;Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, 
                and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess 
                Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the 
                loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful 
                at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew's face.</p>
              <p> 　　The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper 
                lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when 
                necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke 
                into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told 
                of an accident they had had on the Spasski Hill which might have 
                been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that 
                informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg 
                and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and 
                that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odyntsova had married 
                an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, 
                but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still 
                looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full 
                of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train 
                of thought independent of her sister-in-law's words. In the midst 
                of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her 
                brother:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you are really going to the war, Andrew?&quot; she 
                said sighing.</p>
              <p> 　　Lise sighed too.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and even tomorrow,&quot; replied her brother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might 
                have had promotion...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her 
                train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance 
                at her figure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it certain?&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: 
                &quot;Yes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law's 
                and unexpectedly again began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She needs rest,&quot; said Prince Andrew with a frown. 
                &quot;Don't you, Lise? Take her to your room and I'll go to Father. 
                How is he? Just the same?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what your opinion 
                will be,&quot; answered the princess joyfully.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? 
                And the lathe?&quot; asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible 
                smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect 
                for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the 
                mathematics and my geometry lessons,&quot; said Princess Mary 
                gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest 
                delights of her life.</p>
              <p> 　　When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come 
                for the old prince to get up, Tikhon came to call the young prince 
                to his father. The old man made a departure from his usual routine 
                in honor of his son's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to 
                his apartments while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always 
                dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered 
                hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father's dressing room 
                (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing 
                rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), 
                the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped 
                in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?&quot; 
                said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, 
                which Tikhon was holding fast to plait, would allow.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he 
                goes on like this he'll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How 
                are you?&quot; And he held out his cheek.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. 
                (He used to say that a nap &quot;after dinner was silver- before 
                dinner, golden.&quot;) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his 
                son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up 
                and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him. He made no 
                reply on his father's favorite topic- making fun of the military 
                men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Father, I have come come to you and brought my 
                wife who is pregnant,&quot; said Prince Andrew, following every 
                movement of his father's face with an eager and respectful look. 
                &quot;How is your health?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: 
                I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course 
                I am well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank God,&quot; said his son smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,&quot; he 
                continued, returning to his hobby; &quot;tell me how the Germans 
                have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call 
                'strategy.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give me time to collect my wits, Father,&quot; said 
                he, with a smile that showed that his father's foibles did not 
                prevent his son from loving and honoring him. &quot;Why, I have 
                not yet had time to settle down!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nonsense, nonsense!&quot; cried the old man, shaking 
                his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping 
                his by the hand. &quot;The house for your wife is ready. Princess 
                Mary will take her there and show her over, and they'll talk nineteen 
                to the dozen. That's their woman's way! I am glad to have her. 
                Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson's army I understand- Tolstoy's 
                too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what's the southern army 
                to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about Austria?&quot; 
                said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room 
                followed by Tikhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles 
                of clothing. &quot;What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began- at 
                first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, 
                and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as 
                he went on- to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. 
                He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten 
                Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her 
                into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces 
                at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with 
                a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the 
                Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to 
                land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand 
                men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince 
                did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but 
                as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking 
                about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped 
                it by shouting: &quot;The white one, the white one!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he 
                wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And will she soon be confined?&quot; and shaking his 
                head reproachfully said: &quot;That's bad! Go on, go on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing 
                his description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice 
                of old age: &quot;Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand 
                reviendra.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll 
                return.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　His son only smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't say it's a plan I approve of,&quot; said the 
                son; &quot;I am only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also 
                formed his plan by now, not worse than this one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you've told me nothing new,&quot; and the old 
                man repeated, meditatively and rapidly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.&quot;</p>

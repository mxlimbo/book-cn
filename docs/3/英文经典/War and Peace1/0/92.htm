              <p>　　The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere 
                one heard curses on Bonaparte, &quot;the enemy of mankind.&quot; 
                Militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and 
                from the seat of war came contradictory news, false as usual and 
                therefore variously interpreted. The life of old Prince Bolkonski, 
                Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders 
                in chief then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout 
                Russia. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly 
                noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed, 
                he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been 
                appointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for 
                action gave him new energy and strength. He was continually traveling 
                through the three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic in 
                the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruelty with his subordinates, 
                and went into everything down to the minutest details himself. 
                Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her 
                father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study 
                with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather 
                called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse 
                and nurse Savishna in the late princess' rooms and Princess Mary 
                spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother's place 
                to her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, 
                too, seemed passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often 
                deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the 
                little angel- as she called her nephew- and playing with him.</p>
              <p> 　　Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel 
                over the tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a 
                marble monument brought from Italy, representing an angel with 
                outspread wings ready to fly upwards. The angel's upper lip was 
                slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out 
                of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one 
                another that the angel's face reminded them strangely of the little 
                princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew 
                said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor 
                had happened to give the angel's face, Prince Andrew read the 
                same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: &quot;Ah, 
                why have you done this to me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after Prince Andrew's return the old prince made over 
                to him a large estate, Bogucharovo, about twenty-five miles from 
                Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated 
                with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel 
                equal to bearing with his father's peculiarities, and partly because 
                he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo, began 
                building and spent most of his time there.</p>
              <p> 　　After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved 
                not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced 
                and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in 
                the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince 
                and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 
                1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results 
                from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking 
                no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the 
                dark side.</p>
              <p> 　　On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his 
                circuits. Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during 
                his father's absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four 
                days. The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned 
                bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with 
                the letters to Princess Mary's apartments, but did not find him 
                there. He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought 
                some papers,&quot; said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew 
                who was sitting on a child's little chair while, frowning and 
                with trembling hands, he poured drops from a medicine bottle into 
                a wineglass half full of water.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; he said crossly, and, his hand shaking 
                unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw 
                the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The 
                maid brought it.</p>
              <p> 　　There were in the room a child's cot, two boxes, two armchairs, 
                a table, a child's table, and the little chair on which Prince 
                Andrew was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle 
                was burning on the table, screened by a bound music book so that 
                the light did not fall on the cot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear,&quot; said Princess Mary, addressing her brother 
                from beside the cot where she was standing, &quot;better wait 
                a bit... later...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting 
                things off- and this is what comes of it!&quot; said Prince Andrew 
                in an exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear, really... it's better not to wake him... he's 
                asleep,&quot; said the princess in a tone of entreaty.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, 
                wineglass in hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps we'd really better not wake him,&quot; he said 
                hesitating.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As you please... really... I think so... but as you 
                please,&quot; said Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused 
                that her opinion had prevailed. She drew her brother's attention 
                to the maid who was calling him in a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching 
                the boy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting 
                their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had 
                sent to town, they had been trying first one remedy and then another. 
                Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden 
                of sorrow on one another and reproached and disputed with each 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Petrusha has come with papers from your father,&quot; 
                whispered the maid.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew went out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Devil take them!&quot; he muttered, and after listening 
                to the verbal instructions his father had sent and taking the 
                correspondence and his father's letter, he returned to the nursery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still the same. Wait, for heaven's sake. Karl Ivanich 
                always says that sleep is more important than anything,&quot; 
                whispered Princess Mary with a sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning 
                hot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Confound you and your Karl Ivanich!&quot; He took the 
                glass with the drops and again went up to the cot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Andrew, don't!&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in 
                his eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I wish it,&quot; he said. &quot;I beg you- give 
                it him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively 
                and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed 
                hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out 
                and sat down on a sofa in the next room.</p>
              <p> 　　He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically 
                he began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, 
                wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows: </p>
              <p> 　　Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful 
                news- if it's not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete 
                victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, 
                and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is 
                a German- I congratulate him! I can't make out what the commander 
                at Korchevo- a certain Khandrikov- is up to; till now the additional 
                men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once 
                and say I'll have his head off if everything is not here in a 
                week. Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau 
                battle from Petenka- he took part in it- and it's all true. When 
                mischief-makers don't meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He 
                is said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to 
                Korchevo without delay and carry out instructions! </p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. 
                It was a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin. He 
                folded it up without reading it and reread his father's letter, 
                ending with the words: &quot;Gallop off to Korchevo and carry 
                out instructions!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, pardon me, I won't go now till the child is better,&quot; 
                thought he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking 
                the baby.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah yes, and what else did he say that's unpleasant?&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew, recalling his father's letter. &quot;Yes, 
                we have gained a victory over Bonaparte, just when I'm not serving. 
                Yes, yes, he's always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!&quot; 
                And he began reading Bilibin's letter which was written in French. 
                He read without understanding half of it, read only to forget, 
                if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so 
                painfully to the exclusion of all else.</p>

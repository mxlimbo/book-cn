              <p> 　　At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denisov's squadron, 
                in which Nicholas Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration's 
                detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, 
                advancing into action as arranged, and after going behind other 
                columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. 
                Rostov saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons 
                of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go 
                forward and then Generals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with 
                their adjutants. All the fear before action which he had experienced 
                as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all 
                his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this 
                battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and 
                Nicholas Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood. At 
                nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah, 
                and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), 
                and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was 
                brought in, convoyed by a sontnya of Cossacks. Evidently the affair 
                was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement. 
                The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of 
                the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole 
                French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night 
                frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping 
                with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales 
                of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression 
                on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as 
                they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly 
                suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that 
                happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come here, Wostov. Let's dwink to dwown our gwief!&quot; 
                shouted Denisov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask 
                and some food.</p>
              <p> 　　The officers gathered round Denisov's canteen, eating and 
                talking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There! They are bringing another!&quot; cried one of 
                the officers, indicating a captive French dragoon who was being 
                brought in on foot by two Cossacks.</p>
              <p> 　　One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French 
                horse he had taken from the prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sell us that horse!&quot; Denisov called out to the 
                Cossacks.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you like, your honor!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their 
                prisoner. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French 
                with a German accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face 
                was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began 
                speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then another. 
                He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but 
                the corporal's who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though 
                he had told him the Russians were there. And at every word he 
                added: &quot;But don't hurt my little horse!&quot; and stroked 
                the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he 
                was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and 
                now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his 
                soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with 
                him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the 
                French army, which was so alien to us.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostov, 
                being the richest of the officers now that he had received his 
                money, bought it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But don't hurt my little horse!&quot; said the Alsatian 
                good-naturedly to Rostov when the animal was handed over to the 
                hussar.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Alley! Alley!&quot; said the Cossack, touching the prisoner's 
                arm to make him go on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor! The Emperor!&quot; was suddenly heard among 
                the hussars.</p>
              <p> 　　All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the 
                road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. 
                In a moment everyone was in his place, waiting.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and 
                mounted. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and 
                his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly 
                every thought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness 
                at his nearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by 
                itself made up to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as 
                a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring 
                to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious 
                of his approach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs 
                of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything 
                grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive 
                around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding 
                beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself 
                enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, 
                and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord 
                with Rostov's feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which 
                was heard the Emperor's voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Pavlograd hussars?&quot; he inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The reserves, sire!&quot; replied a voice, a very human 
                one compared to that which had said: &quot;The Pavlograd hussars?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor drew level with Rostov and halted. Alexander's 
                face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before 
                at the review. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent 
                youth, that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old 
                boy, and yet it was the face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, 
                while surveying the squadron, the Emperor's eyes met Rostov's 
                and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or no 
                the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostov's soul (it 
                seemed to Rostov that he understood everything), at any rate his 
                light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rostov's face. 
                A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised 
                his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and 
                galloped on.</p>
              <p> 　　The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present 
                at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, 
                at twelve o'clock left the third column with which he had been 
                and galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, 
                several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of 
                the action.</p>
              <p> 　　This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, 
                was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so 
                the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung 
                over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated 
                and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the 
                Emperor had passed, the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance. 
                In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor 
                again. In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy 
                firing before the Emperor's arrival, lay several killed and wounded 
                soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded 
                by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed 
                chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at 
                the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold 
                lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with 
                blood on his uncovered head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, 
                coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked 
                Rostov. Rostov saw how the Emperor's rather round shoulders shuddered 
                as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began 
                convulsively tapping the horse's side with the spur, and how the 
                well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. 
                An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to 
                place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gently, gently! Can't you do it more gently?&quot; said 
                the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, 
                and he rode away.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov saw tears filling the Emperor's eyes and heard him, 
                as he was riding away, say to Czartoryski: &quot;What a terrible 
                thing war is: what a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que 
                la guerre!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, 
                within sight of the enemy's lines, which all day long had yielded 
                ground to us at the least firing. The Emperor's gratitude was 
                announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men 
                received a double ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and 
                the soldiers' songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous 
                night. Denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, 
                and Rostov, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast 
                proposed the Emperor's health. &quot;Not 'our Sovereign, the Emperor,' 
                as they say at official dinners,&quot; said he, &quot;but the 
                health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! 
                Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we fought before,&quot; he said, &quot;not letting 
                the French pass, as at Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now 
                when he is at the front? We will all die for him gladly! Is it 
                not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I have drunk 
                a good deal- but that is how I feel, and so do you too! To the 
                health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah!&quot; rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.</p>
              <p> 　　And the old cavalry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastically 
                and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten 
                filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in 
                hand to the soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, 
                his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic 
                pose in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lads! here's to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory 
                over our enemies! Hurrah!&quot; he exclaimed in his dashing, old, 
                hussar's baritone.</p>
              <p> 　　The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud 
                shouts.</p>
              <p> 　　Late that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his 
                short hand patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As there's no one to fall in love with on campaign, 
                he's fallen in love with the Tsar,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Denisov, don't make fun of it!&quot; cried Rostov. &quot;It 
                is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and 
                appwove...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, you don't understand!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires, 
                dreaming of what happiness it would be to die- not in saving the 
                Emperor's life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply 
                to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and 
                the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. 
                And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during 
                those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine 
                tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though 
                less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian 
                arms.</p>

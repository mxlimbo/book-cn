              <p> 　　Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, 
                looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes 
                ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto 
                motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really 
                was a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. 
                Two mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the 
                hill. A small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down 
                the hill, probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of 
                the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, 
                followed by a report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned 
                his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagration. 
                He heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. 
                Evidently our guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the 
                slope, where the parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.</p>
              <p> 　　Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte's stern 
                letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, 
                had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank 
                both the Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival 
                of the Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood 
                before him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It has begun. Here it is!&quot; thought Prince Andrew, 
                feeling the blood rush to his heart. &quot;But where and how will 
                my Toulon present itself?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge 
                and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere 
                the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting 
                their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the 
                same eagerness that filled his heart. &quot;It has begun! Here 
                it is, dreadful but enjoyable!&quot; was what the face of each 
                soldier and each officer seemed to say.</p>
              <p> 　　Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown 
                up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men 
                coming toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin 
                cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew 
                stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in 
                his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still 
                looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.</p>
              <p> 　　The feeling, &quot;It has begun! Here it is!&quot; was seen 
                even on Prince Bagration's hard brown face with its half-closed, 
                dull, sleepy eyes. Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity 
                at that impassive face and wished he could tell what, if anything, 
                this man was thinking and feeling at that moment. &quot;Is there 
                anything at all behind that impassive face?&quot; Prince Andrew 
                asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagration bent his head in 
                sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, 
                &quot;Very good!&quot; in a tone that seemed to imply that everything 
                that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had 
                foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke 
                quickly. Prince Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental 
                accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that 
                there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot 
                in the direction of Tushin's battery. Prince Andrew followed with 
                the suite. Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, 
                the prince's personal adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the 
                staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian- 
                an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle 
                out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked 
                around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a 
                strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, 
                in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer's 
                saddle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He wants to see a battle,&quot; said Zherkov to Bolkonski, 
                pointing to the accountant, &quot;but he feels a pain in the pit 
                of his stomach already.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, leave off!&quot; said the accountant with a beaming 
                but rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject 
                of Zherkov's joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than 
                he really was.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,&quot; said 
                the staff officer. (He remembered that in French there is some 
                peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it quite 
                right.)</p>
              <p> 　　By this time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and 
                a ball struck the ground in front of them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's that that has fallen?&quot; asked the accountant 
                with a naive smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A French pancake,&quot; answered Zherkov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So that's what they hit with?&quot; asked the accountant. 
                &quot;How awful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished 
                speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling 
                which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! 
                and a Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant, 
                crashed to earth with his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer 
                bent over their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant 
                stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attentive curiosity. 
                The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing 
                the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as 
                if to say, &quot;Is it worth while noticing trifles?&quot; He 
                reined in his horse with the case of a skillful rider and, slightly 
                bending over, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak. 
                It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use. 
                Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvorov giving his saber 
                to Bagration in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant 
                at that moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew 
                had been when he examined the battlefield.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whose company?&quot; asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman 
                standing by the ammunition wagon.</p>
              <p> 　　He asked, &quot;Whose company?&quot; but he really meant, 
                &quot;Are you frightened here?&quot; and the artilleryman understood 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Captain Tushin's, your excellency!&quot; shouted the 
                red-haired, freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; muttered Bagration as if considering 
                something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.</p>
              <p> 　　As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening 
                him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the 
                gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to 
                roll it quickly back to its former position. A huge, broad-shouldered 
                gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang 
                to the wheel; while Number Two with a trembling hand placed a 
                charge in the cannon's mouth. The short, round-shouldered Captain 
                Tushin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward 
                and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with 
                his small hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,&quot; 
                cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing 
                note, ill suited to his weak figure. &quot;Number Two!&quot; he 
                squeaked. &quot;Fire, Medvedev!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers 
                to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like 
                a military salute but like a priest's benediction, approached 
                the general. Though Tushin's guns had been intended to cannonade 
                the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schon 
                Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large masses 
                of French were advancing.</p>
              <p> 　　No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire, 
                but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom 
                he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing 
                to set fire to the village. &quot;Very good!&quot; said Bagration 
                in reply to the officer's report, and began deliberately to examine 
                the whole battlefield extended before him. The French had advanced 
                nearest on our right. Below the height on which the Kiev regiment 
                was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring 
                rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther 
                to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed 
                out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us. To the 
                left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagration 
                ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce 
                the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark to 
                the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would 
                remain without support. Prince Bagration turned to the officer 
                and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to 
                Prince Andrew that the officer's remark was just and that really 
                no answer could be made to it. But at that moment an adjutant 
                galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment 
                in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were 
                coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and 
                was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagration bowed 
                his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk 
                to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders 
                to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half an hour 
                later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already 
                retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been 
                opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened 
                to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very good!&quot; said Bagration.</p>
              <p> 　　As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left 
                also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have 
                time to go there himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell 
                the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before 
                Kutuzov at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible 
                behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would probably 
                not be able to withstand the enemy's attack very long. About Tushin 
                and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all 
                was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagration's 
                colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave 
                them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, 
                but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that everything 
                done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate 
                commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in 
                accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that 
                though what happened was due to chance and was independent of 
                the commander's will, owing to the tact Bagration showed, his 
                presence was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed 
                countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, 
                grew more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious 
                to display their courage before him. </p>

              <p> 　　This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when 
                Barclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign 
                wished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and 
                that Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen's quarters 
                at six that evening.</p>
              <p> 　　News was received at the Emperor's quarters that very day 
                of a fresh movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army- 
                news subsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel 
                Michaud had ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor 
                and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed 
                by Pfuel, and till then considered a chef-d'oeuvre of tactical 
                science which would ensure Napoleon's destruction, was an absurdity, 
                threatening the destruction of the Russian army.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quarters- a country gentleman's 
                house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. 
                Neither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the 
                Emperor's aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that 
                the Emperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, 
                had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications 
                of the Drissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts 
                were beginning to be felt.</p>
              <p> 　　Chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with 
                a French novel in his hand. This room had probably been a music 
                room; there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, 
                and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen's adjutant. 
                This adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, 
                evidently exhausted by work or by feasting. Two doors led from 
                the room, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, 
                and another, on the right, to the study. Through the first door 
                came the sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally 
                in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor's 
                wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), 
                but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of 
                the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, 
                as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor 
                personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General 
                Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon 
                had referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, 
                Count Stein who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, 
                who, as Prince Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole 
                affair. Prince Andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look 
                at him, for Pfuel arrived soon after himself and, in passing through 
                to the drawing room, stopped a minute to speak to Chernyshev.</p>
              <p> 　　At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian 
                general, which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar 
                to Prince Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There 
                was about him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many 
                other German theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 
                1805, but he was more typical than any of them. Prince Andrew 
                had never yet seen a German theorist in whom all the characteristics 
                of those others were united to such an extent.</p>
              <p> 　　Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, 
                robust build, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. 
                His face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had 
                evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, 
                but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts. He entered the room, 
                looking restlessly and angrily around, as if afraid of everything 
                in that large apartment. Awkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed 
                Chernyshev and asked in German where the Emperor was. One could 
                see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible, 
                finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down to business in 
                front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly 
                in reply to Chernyshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that 
                the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, 
                had planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to 
                himself abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans 
                do- it might have been &quot;stupid fellow&quot;... or &quot;the 
                whole affair will be ruined,&quot; or &quot;something absurd will 
                come of it.&quot;... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said 
                and would have passed on, but Chernyshev introduced him to Pfuel, 
                remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the 
                war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced- not so 
                much at Prince Andrew as past him- and said, with a laugh: &quot;That 
                must have been a fine tactical war&quot;; and, laughing contemptuously, 
                went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard.</p>
              <p> 　　Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly 
                disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared 
                to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short 
                interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz 
                experiences, was able to form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel 
                was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men, 
                self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, 
                because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract 
                notion- science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. 
                A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally, 
                both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. 
                An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized 
                state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows 
                what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman 
                is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he 
                is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian 
                is self-assured just because he knows nothing does not want to 
                know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be 
                known. The German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and 
                more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows 
                the truth- science- which he himself has invented but which is 
                for him the absolute truth.</p>
              <p> 　　Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science- the theory 
                of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick 
                the Great's wars, and all he came across in the history of more 
                recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous- monstrous collisions 
                in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these 
                wars could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, 
                and therefore could not serve as material for science.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan 
                of campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt, but he did not see 
                the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters 
                of that war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory 
                were, in his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and 
                with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, &quot;There, 
                I said the whole affair would go to the devil!&quot; Pfuel was 
                one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they 
                lose sight of the theory's object- its practical application. 
                His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and he 
                would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures 
                resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved 
                to him the accuracy of his theory.</p>
              <p> 　　He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about 
                the present war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that 
                all will go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be 
                so. The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily 
                brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.</p>
              <p> 　　He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds 
                of his voice were at once heard from there.</p>

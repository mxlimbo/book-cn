              <p> 　　Natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year 
                to which she had counted on her fingers with Boris after they 
                had kissed four years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before 
                Sonya and her mother, if Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke 
                quite freely of that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten 
                matter that was not worth mentioning. But in the secret depths 
                of her soul the question whether her engagement to Boris was a 
                jest or an important, binding promise tormented her.</p>
              <p> 　　Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had had 
                not seen the Rostovs. He had been in Moscow several times, and 
                had passed near Otradnoe, but had never been to see them.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he not wish to see her, 
                and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her 
                elders spoke of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nowadays old friends are not remembered,&quot; the countess 
                would say when Boris was mentioned.</p>
              <p> 　　Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, 
                seemed to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke 
                rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant 
                career on which he had entered. When the Rostovs came to Petersburg 
                Boris called on them.</p>
              <p> 　　He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natasha 
                was his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention 
                of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations 
                between himself and Natasha could not be binding either on her 
                or on him. He had a brilliant position in society thanks to his 
                intimacy with Countess Bezukhova, a brilliant position in the 
                service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose 
                complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was beginning to make plans 
                for marrying one of the richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans 
                which might very easily be realized. When he entered the Rostovs' 
                drawing room Natasha was in her own room. When she heard of his 
                arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and beaming 
                with a more than cordial smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris remembered Natasha in a short dress, with dark eyes 
                shining from under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, 
                as he had known her four years before; and so he was taken aback 
                when quite a different Natasha entered, and his face expressed 
                rapturous astonishment. This expression on his face pleased Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?&quot; 
                asked the countess.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris kissed Natasha's hand and said that he was astonished 
                at the change in her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How handsome you have grown!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should think so!&quot; replied Natasha's laughing 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And is Papa older?&quot; she asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha sat down and, without joining in Boris' conversation 
                with the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood's 
                suitor. He felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny 
                and glanced at her occasionally.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed 
                were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natasha 
                noticed at once. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to 
                the countess, arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves 
                that fitted his left hand like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly 
                refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest 
                Petersburg society, recalling with mild irony old times in Moscow 
                and Moscow acquaintances. It was not accidentally, Natasha felt, 
                that he alluded, when speaking of the highest aristocracy, to 
                an ambassador's ball he had attended, and to invitations he had 
                received from N.N. and S.S.</p>
              <p> 　　All this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from 
                under her brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and 
                more. He looked round more frequently toward her, and broke off 
                in what he was saying. He did not stay more than ten minutes, 
                then rose and took his leave. The same inquisitive, challenging, 
                and rather mocking eyes still looked at him. After his first visit 
                Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much 
                as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling, because to 
                marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to his 
                career, while to renew their former relations without intending 
                to marry her would be dishonorable. Boris made up his mind to 
                avoid meeting Natasha, but despite that resolution he called again 
                a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days 
                at the Rostovs'. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation 
                with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, 
                that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that 
                he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. But he 
                failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation. 
                From day to day he became more and more entangled. It seemed to 
                her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love with Boris as of 
                old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him her album, making 
                him write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past, letting 
                it be understood how was the present; and every day he went away 
                in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not knowing 
                what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He 
                left off visiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her 
                every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs.</p>

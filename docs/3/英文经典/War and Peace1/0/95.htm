              <p> 　　Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest 
                state of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had 
                of visiting his friend Bolkonski, whom he had not seen for two 
                years.</p>
              <p> 　　Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country 
                among fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut 
                down. The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water 
                to the brink and with banks still bare of grass. It was at the 
                end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst 
                of a young copse in which were a few fir trees.</p>
              <p> 　　The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, 
                a bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular 
                facade still in course of construction. Round the house was a 
                garden newly laid out. The fences and gates were new and solid; 
                two fire pumps and a water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; 
                the paths were straight, the bridges were strong and had handrails. 
                Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management. Some 
                domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to where the 
                prince lived, pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the 
                pond. Anton, a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood, 
                helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the prince was at 
                home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean 
                house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met 
                his friend in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered 
                wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but 
                Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; came a sharp, unpleasant voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A visitor,&quot; answered Anton.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ask him to wait,&quot; and the sound was heard of a 
                chair being pushed back.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came 
                face to face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking 
                old. Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his 
                friend on the cheek and looked at him closely.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,&quot; said 
                Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with 
                surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly 
                and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were 
                dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he 
                could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had 
                grown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking, but what amazed 
                and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and 
                a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some 
                one thought.</p>
              <p> 　　As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged 
                separation, it was long before their conversation could settle 
                on anything. They put questions and gave brief replies about things 
                they knew ought to be talked over at length. At last the conversation 
                gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched 
                on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre's journeys and 
                occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and despondency 
                which Pierre had noticed in his friend's look was now still more 
                clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, 
                especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or 
                the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize 
                with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to 
                feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, 
                and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew's presence. 
                He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been 
                particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked 
                himself, fearing to seem naive, yet he felt an irresistible desire 
                to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite 
                different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't tell you how much I have lived through since 
                then. I hardly know myself again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and you? What are your plans?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Plans!&quot; repeated Prince Andrew ironically. &quot;My 
                plans?&quot; he said, as if astonished at the word. &quot;Well, 
                you see, I'm building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew's 
                face, which had grown much older.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I meant to ask...&quot; Pierre began, but Prince 
                Andrew interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about 
                your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying 
                as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements 
                that had been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre's 
                story of what he had been doing, as though it were all an old-time 
                story, and he listened not only without interest but even as if 
                ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend's 
                company and at last became silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll tell you what, my dear fellow,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew, who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with 
                his visitor, &quot;I am only bivouacking here and have just come 
                to look round. I am going back to my sister today. I will introduce 
                you to her. But of course you know her already,&quot; he said, 
                evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found 
                nothing in common. &quot;We will go after dinner. And would you 
                now like to look round my place?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of 
                the political news and common acquaintances like people who do 
                not know each other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some 
                animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing 
                and its buildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in 
                the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the 
                house, he interrupted himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have 
                dinner, and then we'll set off.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre's marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was very much surprised when I heard of it,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and 
                said hurriedly: &quot;I will tell you some time how it all happened. 
                But you know it is all over, and forever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forever?&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;Nothing's forever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you know how it all ended, don't you? You heard 
                of the duel?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so you had to go through that too!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that 
                man,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why so?&quot; asked Prince Andrew. &quot;To kill a vicious 
                dog is a very good thing really.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, to kill a man is bad- wrong.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is it wrong?&quot; urged Prince Andrew. &quot;It 
                is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong. Men 
                always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in what 
                they consider right and wrong.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does harm to another is wrong,&quot; said Pierre, 
                feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival 
                Prince Andrew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express 
                what had brought him to his present state.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And who has told you what is bad for another man?&quot; 
                he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bad! Bad!&quot; exclaimed Pierre. &quot;We all know 
                what is bad for ourselves.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in 
                myself is something I cannot inflict on others,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew, growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to 
                express his new outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. &quot;I 
                only know two very real evils in life: remorse and illness. The 
                only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself avoiding 
                those two evils is my whole philosophy now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And love of one's neighbor, and self-sacrifice?&quot; 
                began Pierre. &quot;No, I can't agree with you! To live only so 
                as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough. I lived 
                like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And only now 
                when I am living, or at least trying&quot; (Pierre's modesty made 
                him correct himself) &quot;to live for others, only now have I 
                understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree with 
                you, and you do not really believe what you are saying.&quot; 
                Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you'll get on 
                with her,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps you are right for yourself,&quot; 
                he added after a short pause, &quot;but everyone lives in his 
                own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your 
                life and only found happiness when you began living for others. 
                I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.- And after 
                all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something 
                for them, a desire for their approval.- So I lived for others, 
                and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer 
                since I began to live only for myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what do you mean by living only for yourself?&quot; 
                asked Pierre, growing excited. &quot;What about your son, your 
                sister, and your father?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But that's just the same as myself- they are not others,&quot; 
                explained Prince Andrew. &quot;The others, one's neighbors, le 
                prochain, as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source 
                of all error and evil. Le prochain- your Kiev peasants to whom 
                you want to do good.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. 
                He evidently wished to draw him on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are joking,&quot; replied Pierre, growing more and 
                more excited. &quot;What error or evil can there be in my wishing 
                to do good, and even doing a little- though I did very little 
                and did it very badly? What evil can there be in it if unfortunate 
                people, our serfs, people like ourselves, were growing up and 
                dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless 
                prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future 
                life, retribution, recompense, and consolation? What evil and 
                error are there in it, if people were dying of disease without 
                help while material assistance could so easily be rendered, and 
                I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum for the 
                aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, 
                or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them 
                rest and leisure?&quot; said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. &quot;And 
                I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have 
                done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was 
                not a good action, and more than that, you can't make me believe 
                that you do not think so yourself. And the main thing is,&quot; 
                he continued, &quot;that I know, and know for certain, that the 
                enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, if you put it like that it's quite a different 
                matter,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;I build a house and lay 
                out a garden, and you build hospitals. The one and the other may 
                serve as a pastime. But what's right and what's good must be judged 
                by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an argument,&quot; 
                he added, come on then.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch 
                which served as a veranda.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, let's argue then,&quot; said Prince Andrew, &quot;You 
                talk of schools,&quot; he went on, crooking a finger, &quot;education 
                and so forth; that is, you want to raise him&quot; (pointing to 
                a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap) &quot;from his 
                animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it seems 
                to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and 
                that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but 
                you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then 
                you say, 'lighten his toil.' But as I see it, physical labor is 
                as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as 
                mental activity is to you or me. You can't help thinking. I go 
                to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can't sleep 
                but toss about till dawn, because I think and can't help thinking, 
                just as he can't help plowing and mowing; if he didn't, he would 
                go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his 
                terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he 
                could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die. 
                The third thing- what else was it you talked about?&quot; and 
                Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. &quot;Ah, yes, hospitals, 
                medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and bleed him 
                and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to 
                everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler 
                for him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of 
                them as it is. It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer- 
                that's how I regard him- but you want to cure him from love of 
                him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a notion that 
                medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!&quot; said he, frowning 
                angrily and turning away from Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly 
                that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than 
                once, and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not 
                talked for a long time. His glance became more animated as his 
                conclusions became more hopeless.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I 
                don't understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such 
                moments myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but 
                at such times I collapsed so that I don't live at all- everything 
                seems hateful to me... myself most of all. Then I don't eat, don't 
                wash... and how is it with you?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not wash? That is not cleanly,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew; &quot;on the contrary one must try to make one's life 
                as pleasant as possible. I'm alive, that is not my fault, so I 
                must live out my life as best I can without hurting others.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But with such ideas what motive have you for living? 
                One would sit without moving, undertaking nothing....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful 
                to do nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have 
                done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all 
                I could do to get out of it. They could not understand that I 
                have not the necessary qualifications for it- the kind of good-natured, 
                fussy shallowness necessary for the position. Then there's this 
                house, which must be built in order to have a nook of one's own 
                in which to be quiet. And now there's this recruiting.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why aren't you serving in the army?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;After Austerlitz!&quot; said Prince Andrew gloomily. 
                &quot;No, thank you very much! I have promised myself not to serve 
                again in the active Russian army. And I won't- not even if Bonaparte 
                were here at Smolensk threatening Bald Hills- even then I wouldn't 
                serve in the Russian army! Well, as I was saying,&quot; he continued, 
                recovering his composure, &quot;now there's this recruiting. My 
                father is chief in command of the Third District, and my only 
                way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then you are serving?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused a little while.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why do you serve?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable 
                men of his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly 
                cruel he has too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to 
                unlimited power that he is terrible, and now he has this authority 
                of a commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. 
                If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had 
                a paymaster's clerk at Yukhnovna hanged,&quot; said Prince Andrew 
                with a smile. &quot;So I am serving because I alone have any influence 
                with my father, and now and then can save him from actions which 
                would torment him afterwards.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, there you see!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, but it is not as you imagine,&quot; Prince Andrew 
                continued. &quot;I did not, and do not, in the least care about 
                that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits; 
                I should even have been very glad to see him hanged, but I was 
                sorry for my father- that again is for myself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered 
                feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions 
                there was no desire to do good to his neighbor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,&quot; he 
                continued; &quot;that is a very good thing, but not for you- I 
                don't suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberia- 
                and still less for your serfs. If they are beaten, flogged, or 
                sent to Siberia, I don't suppose they are any the worse off. In 
                Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on their 
                bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing 
                for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, 
                stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able 
                to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people 
                I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. 
                You may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up 
                in those traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow 
                more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but 
                cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help 
                thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew 
                by his father's case.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So that's what I'm sorry for- human dignity, peace of 
                mind, purity, and not the serfs' backs and foreheads, which, beat 
                and shave as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with 
                you,&quot; said Pierre. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.</p>
              <p> 　　All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates- and constantly 
                changing from one thing to another had never accomplished- were 
                carried out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible 
                difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre 
                lacked, and without fuss or strain on his part this set things 
                going.</p>
              <p> 　　On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated 
                and became free agricultural laborers- this being one of the first 
                examples of the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs' compulsory 
                labor was commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged 
                for Bogucharovo at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach 
                reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household 
                serfs.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father 
                and his son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half 
                he spent in &quot;Bogucharovo Cloister,&quot; as his father called 
                Prince Andrew's estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs 
                of the world he had expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed 
                all that went on, received many books, and to his surprise noticed 
                that when he or his father had visitors from Petersburg, the very 
                vortex of life, these people lagged behind himself- who never 
                left the country- in knowledge of what was happening in home and 
                foreign affairs.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great 
                variety of books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical 
                of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing 
                up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations.</p>
              <p> 　　In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates 
                which had been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.</p>
              <p> 　　Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking 
                at the new grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first 
                puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. 
                He was not thinking of anything, but looked absent-mindedly and 
                cheerfully from side to side.</p>
              <p> 　　They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the 
                year before. They went through the muddy village, past threshing 
                floors and green fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still 
                lodged near the bridge, uphill where the clay had been liquefied 
                by the rain, past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with 
                green here and there, and into a birch forest growing on both 
                sides of the road. In the forest it was almost hot, no wind could 
                be felt. The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless, 
                and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass 
                were pushing up and lifting last year's leaves. The coarse evergreen 
                color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the 
                birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the 
                forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.</p>
              <p> 　　Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter 
                assented. But apparently the coachman's sympathy was not enough 
                for Peter, and he turned on the box toward his master.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How pleasant it is, your excellency!&quot; he said with 
                a respectful smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's pleasant, your excellency!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is he talking about?&quot; thought Prince Andrew. 
                &quot;Oh, the spring, I suppose,&quot; he thought as he turned 
                round. &quot;Yes, really everything is green already.... How early! 
                The birches and cherry and alders too are coming out.... But the 
                oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times 
                the age of the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times 
                as thick and twice as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its 
                girth twice as great as a man could embrace, and evidently long 
                ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred. 
                With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its 
                gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged, stern, and scornful 
                monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking evergreen 
                firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield 
                to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Spring, love, happiness!&quot; this oak seemed to say. 
                &quot;Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly 
                repeated fraud? Always the same and always a fraud? There is no 
                spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those cramped dead firs, 
                ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken and barked 
                fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or my 
                sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in 
                your hopes and your lies.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several 
                times to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. 
                Under the oak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among 
                them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew. &quot;Let others- the young- yield afresh 
                to that fraud, but we know life, our life is finished!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully 
                pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During 
                this journey he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived 
                at his old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was 
                not for him to begin anything anew- but that he must live out 
                his life, content to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or 
                desiring anything. </p>

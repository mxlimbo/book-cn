              <p> 　　On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club 
                were filled with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming 
                in springtime. The members and guests of the Club wandered hither 
                and thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and 
                some in evening dress, and a few here and there with powdered 
                hair and in Russian kaftans. Powdered footmen, in livery with 
                buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at every door anxiously 
                noting visitors' every movement in order to offer their services. 
                Most of those present were elderly, respected men with broad, 
                self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. 
                This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places 
                and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present 
                were casual guests- chiefly young men, among whom were Denisov, 
                Rostov, and Dolokhov- who was now again an officer in the Semenov 
                regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who 
                were militarymen, bore that expression of condescending respect 
                for their elders which seems to say to the older generation, &quot;We 
                are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same remember 
                that the future belongs to us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club. Pierre, 
                who at his wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned 
                his spectacles, went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking 
                sad and dull. Here, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere 
                of subservience to his wealth, and being in the habit of lording 
                it over these people, he treated them with absent-minded contempt.</p>
              <p> 　　By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but 
                by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and 
                honored guests, and so he went from one group to another. Some 
                of the most important old men were the center of groups which 
                even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known 
                men. The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin, Valuev, 
                and Naryshkin. Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had 
                been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their 
                way through them with bayonets.</p>
              <p> 　　Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent 
                from Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　In the third circle, Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting 
                of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a 
                cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. 
                Shinshin, standing close by, tried to make a joke, saying that 
                Kutuzov had evidently failed to learn from Suvorov even so simple 
                a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but the elder members 
                glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in that place 
                and on that day, it was improper to speak so of Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Ilya Rostov, hurried and preoccupied, went about in 
                his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting 
                the important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they 
                were all equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine 
                well-set-up young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at 
                him. Young Rostov stood at a window with Dolokhov, whose acquaintance 
                he had lately made and highly valued. The old count came up to 
                them and pressed Dolokhov's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... 
                been together out there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasili 
                Ignatovich... How d'ye do, old fellow?&quot; he said, turning 
                to an old man who was passing, but before he had finished his 
                greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who had run in 
                announced, with a frightened face: &quot;He's arrived!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and- like rye shaken 
                together in a shovel- the guests who had been scattered about 
                in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing 
                room by the door of the ballroom.</p>
              <p> 　　Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without 
                hat or sword, which, in accord with the Club custom, he had given 
                up to the hall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor 
                had he a loaded whip over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen 
                him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new 
                uniform with Russian and foreign Orders, and the Star of St. George 
                on his left breast. Evidently just before coming to the dinner 
                he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed, which changed his appearance 
                for the worse. There was something naively festive in his air, 
                which, in conjunction with his firm and virile features, gave 
                him a rather comical expression. Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov, 
                who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him, 
                as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagration was embarrassed, 
                not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused 
                some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. 
                He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception 
                room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed 
                to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at the 
                head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern- and he would have 
                found that easier. The committeemen met him at the first door 
                and, expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored 
                guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting for 
                his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It 
                was at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the 
                crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to 
                get a good look at Bagration over each other's shoulders, as if 
                he were some rare animal. Count Ilya Rostov, laughing and repeating 
                the words, &quot;Make way, dear boy! Make way, make way!&quot; 
                pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone, led the 
                guests into the drawing room, and seated them on the center sofa. 
                The bigwigs, the most respected members of the Club, beset the 
                new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way through the 
                crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later 
                with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver which 
                he presented to Prince Bagration. On the salver lay some verses 
                composed and printed in the hero's honor. Bagration, on seeing 
                the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. 
                But all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in 
                their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and 
                looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented 
                it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration (or 
                he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in 
                to dinner with it) and drew his attention to the verses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I will read them, then!&quot; Bagration seemed 
                to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read 
                them with a fixed and serious expression. But the author himself 
                took the verses and began reading them aloud. Bagration bowed 
                his bead and listened: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Bring glory then to Alexander's reign</p>
              <p> 　　　　 And on the throne our Titus shield.</p>
              <p> 　　　　 A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!</p>
              <p> 　　　　 E'en fortunate Napoleon</p>
              <p> 　　　　 Knows by experience, now, Bagration,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 And dare not Herculean Russians trouble... But before he 
                had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner 
                was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came the 
                resounding strains of the polonaise: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Conquest's joyful thunder waken,</p>
              <p> 　　　　 Triumph, valiant Russians, now!... and Count Rostov, glancing 
                angrily at the author who went on reading his verses, bowed to 
                Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more important 
                than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the rest, went 
                in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two 
                Alexanders- Bekleshev and Naryshkin- which was a significant allusion 
                to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their 
                seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: 
                the more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as 
                water flows deepest where the land lies lowest.</p>
              <p> 　　Just before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to 
                Bagration, who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed 
                and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count 
                Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke 
                to his son.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov, 
                sat almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, 
                beside Prince Nesvitski. Count Ilya Rostov with the other members 
                of the committee sat facing Bagration and, as the very personification 
                of Moscow hospitality, did the honors to the prince.</p>
              <p> 　　His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten 
                and the other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite 
                at ease till the end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered 
                directions to the footmen, and awaited each expected dish with 
                some anxiety. Everything was excellent. With the second course, 
                a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with 
                self-conscious pleasure), the footmen began popping corks and 
                filling the champagne glasses. After the fish, which made a certain 
                sensation, the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen. 
                &quot;There will be many toasts, it's time to begin,&quot; he 
                whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were silent, 
                waiting for what he would say.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!&quot; he 
                cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with 
                tears of joy and enthusiasm. The band immediately struck up &quot;Conquest's 
                joyful thunder waken...&quot; All rose and cried &quot;Hurrah!&quot; 
                Bagration also rose and shouted &quot;Hurrah!&quot; in exactly 
                the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon 
                Grabern. Young Rostov's ecstatic voice could be heard above the 
                three hundred others. He nearly wept. &quot;To the health of our 
                Sovereign, the Emperor!&quot; he roared, &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and 
                emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many 
                followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long 
                time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken 
                glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they 
                had made and exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, 
                glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, 
                &quot;To the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter 
                Ivanovich Bagration!&quot; and again his blue eyes grew moist. 
                &quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried the three hundred voices again, but 
                instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by 
                Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Russians! O'er all barriers on!</p>
              <p> 　　　　 Courage conquest guarantees;</p>
              <p> 　　　　 Have we not Bagration?</p>
              <p> 　　　　 He brings foe men to their knees,... etc. </p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast 
                was proposed and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, 
                more glass was smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank 
                to Bekleshev, Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, 
                to the committee, to all the Club members and to all the Club 
                guests, and finally to Count Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer 
                of the banquet. At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief 
                and, covering his face, wept outright. </p>

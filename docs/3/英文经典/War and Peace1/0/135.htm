              <p> 　　The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts 
                congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had 
                thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish 
                strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and against the 
                pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines 
                and the copses, which at the end of August had still been green 
                islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and bright-red 
                islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had already half 
                changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to scatter, 
                and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best time 
                of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young sportsman 
                Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were 
                so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give 
                them a three days' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, 
                to go on a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where 
                there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.</p>
              <p> 　　All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and 
                the air was sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast 
                and it began to thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rostov, in 
                his dressing gown, looked out of the window, he saw it was an 
                unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if the sky were melting 
                and sinking to the earth without any wind. The only motion in 
                the air was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of drizzling 
                mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent 
                drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in the 
                kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed 
                and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist. 
                Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell 
                of decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched 
                bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, 
                stretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly 
                jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache. Another 
                borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the garden path, 
                arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted 
                tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O-hoy!&quot; came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman's 
                call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and 
                round the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, 
                a gray, wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, 
                Ukrainian fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look 
                of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. 
                He doffed his Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. 
                This scorn was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that 
                this Daniel, disdainful of everybody and who considered himself 
                above them, was all the same his serf and huntsman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Daniel!&quot; Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the 
                sight of the weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was 
                being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which 
                makes a man forget all his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets 
                in the presence of his mistress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What orders, your excellency?&quot; said the huntsman 
                in his deep bass, deep as a proto-deacon's and hoarse with hallooing- 
                and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his 
                master, who was silent. &quot;Can you resist it?&quot; those eyes 
                seemed to be asking.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?&quot; 
                asked Nicholas, scratching Milka behind the ears.</p>
              <p> 　　Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen,&quot; his bass boomed 
                out after a minute's pause. &quot;He says she's moved them into 
                the Otradnoe enclosure. They were howling there.&quot; (This meant 
                that the she-wolf, about whom they both knew, had moved with her 
                cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a small place a mile and a half from 
                the house.)</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We ought to go, don't you think so?&quot; said Nicholas. 
                &quot;Come to me with Uvarka.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As you please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then put off feeding them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Five minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas' 
                big study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room 
                was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture 
                and surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and 
                as usual stood just inside the door, trying to speak softly and 
                not move, for fear of breaking something in the master's apartment, 
                and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from 
                under that ceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.</p>
              <p> 　　Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an 
                opinion that the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go 
                hunting), Nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just 
                as Daniel was about to go Natasha came in with rapid steps, not 
                having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old 
                nurse's big shawl wrapped round her. Petya ran in at the same 
                time.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are going?&quot; asked Natasha. &quot;I knew you 
                would! Sonya said you wouldn't go, but I knew that today is the 
                sort of day when you couldn't help going.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, we are going,&quot; replied Nicholas reluctantly, 
                for today, as he intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to 
                take Natasha and Petya. &quot;We are going, but only wolf hunting: 
                it would be dull for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know it is my greatest pleasure,&quot; said Natasha. 
                &quot;It's not fair; you are going by yourself, are having the 
                horses saddled and said nothing to us about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'No barrier bars a Russian's path'- we'll go!&quot; 
                shouted Petya.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't,&quot; said Nicholas 
                to Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I'll go. I shall certainly go,&quot; said Natasha 
                decisively. &quot;Daniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael 
                must come with my dogs,&quot; she added to the huntsman.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at 
                all, but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him 
                impossible. He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were 
                none of his business, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental 
                injury on the young lady. </p>

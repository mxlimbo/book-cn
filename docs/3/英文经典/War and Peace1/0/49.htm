              <p> 　　The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder 
                smoke, hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was 
                growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. 
                The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind 
                and on the right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Tushin 
                with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded 
                men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, 
                he was met by some of the staff, among them the staff officer 
                and Zherkov, who had been twice sent to Tushin's battery but had 
                never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all gave, and 
                transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching 
                him. Tushin gave no orders, and, silently- fearing to speak because 
                at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why- rode 
                behind on his artillery nag. Though the orders were to abandon 
                the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after troops and 
                begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty infantry officer 
                who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin's wattle shed 
                was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on &quot;Matvevna's&quot; 
                carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting 
                one hand with the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Captain, for God's sake! I've hurt my arm,&quot; he 
                said timidly. &quot;For God's sake... I can't walk. For God's 
                sake!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked 
                for a lift and been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous 
                voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tell them to give me a seat, for God's sake!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give him a seat,&quot; said Tushin. &quot;Lay a cloak 
                for him to sit on, lad,&quot; he said, addressing his favorite 
                soldier. &quot;And where is the wounded officer?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has been set down. He died,&quot; replied someone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread 
                out the cloak, Antonov.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The cadet was Rostov. With one hand he supported the other; 
                he was pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was 
                placed on &quot;Matvevna,&quot; the gun from which they had removed 
                the dead officer. The cloak they spread under him was wet with 
                blood which stained his breeches and arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What, are you wounded, my lad?&quot; said Tushin, approaching 
                the gun on which Rostov sat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's a sprain.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?&quot; inquired 
                Tushin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was the officer, your honor, stained it,&quot; answered 
                the artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, 
                as if apologizing for the state of his gun.</p>
              <p> 　　It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise 
                aided by the infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf 
                they halted. It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish 
                the uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. 
                Suddenly, near by on the right, shouting and firing were again 
                heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last 
                French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the 
                village houses. They all rushed out of the village again, but 
                Tushin's guns could not move, and the artillerymen, Tushin, and 
                the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate. 
                The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out 
                of a side street.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not hurt, Petrov?&quot; asked one.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't make another 
                push now,&quot; said another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You couldn't see a thing. How they shot at their own 
                fellows! Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn't there 
                something to drink?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again 
                and again in the complete darkness Tushin's guns moved forward, 
                surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame.</p>
              <p> 　　In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river 
                was flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and 
                talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, 
                the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard 
                than any other sound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that 
                enveloped the army was filled with their groans, which seemed 
                to melt into one with the darkness of the night. After a while 
                the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white 
                horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: &quot;What 
                did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?&quot; 
                came eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began 
                pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered 
                to halt: evidently those in front had halted. All remained where 
                they were in the middle of the muddy road.</p>
              <p> 　　Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain 
                Tushin, having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to 
                find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down 
                by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostov, too, 
                dragged himself to the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish 
                shivering shook his whole body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering 
                him, but he kept awake kept awake by an excruciating pain in his 
                arm, for which he could find no satisfactory position. He kept 
                closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed 
                to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered figure 
                of Tushin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him. 
                Tushin's large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy 
                and commiseration on Rostov, who saw that Tushin with his whole 
                heart wished to help him but could not.</p>
              <p> 　　From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, 
                who were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. 
                The sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving 
                in mud, the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into 
                one tremulous rumble.</p>
              <p> 　　It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing 
                through the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding 
                after a storm. Rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what 
                passed before and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, 
                squatted on his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned 
                away his face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You don't mind your honor?&quot; he asked Tushin. &quot;I've 
                lost my company, your honor. I don't know where... such bad luck!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek 
                came up to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to have 
                the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, 
                two soldiers rushed to the campfire. They were quarreling and 
                fighting desperately, each trying to snatch from the other a boot 
                they were both holding on to.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You picked it up?... I dare say! You're very smart!&quot; 
                one of them shouted hoarsely.</p>
              <p> 　　Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained 
                leg band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for 
                water.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Must one die like a dog?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Tushin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful 
                soldier ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck 
                to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire- we'll return it 
                with interest,&quot; said he, carrying away into the darkness 
                a glowing stick.</p>
              <p> 　　Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, 
                and passed by the fire. One of them stumbled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who the devil has put the logs on the road?&quot; snarled 
                he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's dead- why carry him?&quot; said another.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shut up!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And they disappeared into the darkness with with their load.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still aching?&quot; Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your honor, you're wanted by the general. He is in the 
                hut here,&quot; said a gunner, coming up to Tushin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Coming, friend.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, 
                walked away from the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been 
                prepared for him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talking with 
                some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The 
                little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing 
                a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for 
                twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; 
                and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkov, uneasily 
                glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed 
                lips and feverishly glittering eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the 
                French, and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its 
                texture, shaking his head in perplexity- perhaps because the banner 
                really interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry 
                as he was, to look on at a dinner where there was no place for 
                him. In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken 
                prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look 
                at him. Prince Bagration was thanking the individual commanders 
                and inquiring into details of the action and our losses. The general 
                whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the 
                prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from 
                the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing 
                the French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions 
                and had broken up the French troops.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion 
                was disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: 'I'll let 
                them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'- 
                and that's what I did.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had 
                not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really 
                happened. Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly 
                make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,&quot; 
                he continued- remembering Dolokhov's conversation with Kutuzov 
                and his last interview with the gentleman-ranker- &quot;that Private 
                Dolokhov, who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer 
                prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,&quot; 
                chimed in Zherkov, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the 
                hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry 
                officer. &quot;They broke up two squares, your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Several of those present smiled at Zherkov's words, expecting 
                one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded 
                to the glory of our arms and of the day's work, they assumed a 
                serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was 
                saying was a lie devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagration turned 
                to the old colonel:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: 
                infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were 
                abandoned in the center?&quot; he inquired, searching with his 
                eyes for someone. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns 
                on the left flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned 
                at the very beginning of the action.) &quot;I think I sent you?&quot; 
                he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One was damaged,&quot; answered the staff officer, &quot;and 
                the other I can't understand. I was there all the time giving 
                orders and had only just left.... It is true that it was hot there,&quot; 
                he added, modestly.</p>
              <p> 　　Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close 
                to the village and had already been sent for.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, but you were there?&quot; said Prince Bagration, 
                addressing Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course, we only just missed one another,&quot; said 
                the staff officer, with a smile to Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I had not the pleasure of seeing you,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew, coldly and abruptly.</p>
              <p> 　　All were silent. Tushin appeared at the threshold and made 
                his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped 
                past the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he 
                always was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the 
                staff of the banner and stumbled over it. Several of those present 
                laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How was it a gun was abandoned?&quot; asked Bagration, 
                frowning, not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing, 
                among whom Zherkov laughed loudest.</p>
              <p> 　　Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, 
                did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet 
                remaining alive present themselves to Tushin in all their horror. 
                He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until 
                that moment. The officers' laughter confused him still more. He 
                stood before Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly 
                able to mutter: &quot;I don't know... your excellency... I had 
                no men... your excellency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You might have taken some from the covering troops.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops, though 
                that was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer 
                into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy 
                who has blundered looks at an examiner.</p>
              <p> 　　The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagration, apparently 
                not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did 
                not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from 
                under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your excellency!&quot; Prince Andrew broke the silence 
                with his abrupt voice,&quot; you were pleased to send me to Captain 
                Tushin's battery. I went there and found two thirds of the men 
                and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no supports at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at 
                Bolkonski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And, if your excellency will allow me to express my 
                opinion,&quot; he continued, &quot;we owe today's success chiefly 
                to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain 
                Tushin and his company,&quot; and without awaiting a reply, Prince 
                Andrew rose and left the table.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to 
                show distrust in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling 
                able fully to credit it, bent his head, and told Tushin that he 
                could go. Prince Andrew went out with him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!&quot; said 
                Tushin.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. 
                He felt sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what 
                he had hoped. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? 
                And when will all this end?&quot; thought Rostov, looking at the 
                changing shadows before him. The pain in his arm became more and 
                more intense. Irresistible drowsiness overpowered him, red rings 
                danced before his eyes, and the impression of those voices and 
                faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain. 
                It was they, these soldiers- wounded and unwounded- it was they 
                who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and 
                scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself 
                of them he closed his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable 
                things appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white 
                hand, Sonya's thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and laughter, 
                Denisov with his voice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that 
                affair with Telyanin and Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing 
                as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and 
                this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and 
                pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried 
                to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his 
                shoulder move a hair's breadth. It would not ache- it would be 
                well- if only they did not pull it, but it was immpossible to 
                get rid of them.</p>
              <p> 　　He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night 
                hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of 
                falling snow were fluttering in that light. Tushin had not returned, 
                the doctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier 
                who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his 
                thin yellow body.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nobody wants me!&quot; thought Rostov. &quot;There is 
                no one to help me or pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, 
                happy, and loved.&quot; He sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, is anything hurting you?&quot; asked the soldier, 
                shaking his shirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer 
                he gave a grunt and added: &quot;What a lot of men have been crippled 
                today- frightful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes 
                fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his 
                warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, 
                his healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. 
                &quot;And why did I come here?&quot; he wondered.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the 
                remnant of Bagration's detachment was reunited to Kutuzov's army.</p>

              <p> 　　In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the Pavlograds 
                did not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. 
                Rostov, who felt his friend's absence very much, having no news 
                of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound 
                and the progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice 
                to get leave to visit Denisov in hospital.</p>
              <p> 　　The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice 
                devastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, 
                when it is so beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented 
                a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, 
                its foul streets, tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken 
                soldiers wandering about.</p>
              <p> 　　The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window 
                frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains 
                of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged 
                soldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about 
                in the sunshine in the yard.</p>
              <p> 　　Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell 
                of putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian 
                army doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian 
                assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't tear myself to pieces,&quot; the doctor was 
                saying. &quot;Come to Makar Alexeevich in the evening. I shall 
                be there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The assistant asked some further questions.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, do the best you can! Isn't it all the same?&quot; 
                The doctor noticed Rostov coming upstairs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you want, sir?&quot; said the doctor. &quot;What 
                do you want? The bullets having spared you, do you want to try 
                typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How so?&quot; asked Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Typhus, sir. It's death to go in. Only we two, Makeev 
                and I&quot; (he pointed to the assistant), &quot;keep on here. 
                Some five of us doctors have died in this place.... When a new 
                one comes he is done for in a week,&quot; said the doctor with 
                evident satisfaction. &quot;Prussian doctors have been invited 
                here, but our allies don't like it at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the 
                hussars, who was wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know. I can't tell you, sir. Only think! I am 
                alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred 
                patients! It's well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us 
                two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be 
                lost!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Four hundred, sir, and they're always 
                sending me fresh ones. There are four hundred? Eh?&quot; he asked, 
                turning to the assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and 
                impatient for the talkative doctor to go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Major Denisov,&quot; Rostov said again. &quot;He was 
                wounded at Molliten.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makeev?&quot; queried the doctor, 
                in a tone of indifference.</p>
              <p> 　　The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor's words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he tall and with reddish hair?&quot; asked the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov described Denisov's appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There was one like that,&quot; said the doctor, as if 
                pleased. &quot;That one is dead, I fancy. However, I'll look up 
                our list. We had a list. Have you got it, Makeev?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Makar Alexeevich has the list,&quot; answered the assistant. 
                &quot;But if you'll step into the officers' wards you'll see for 
                yourself,&quot; he added, turning to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, you'd better not go, sir,&quot; said the doctor, 
                &quot;or you may have to stay here yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the 
                assistant to show him the way.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only don't blame me!&quot; the doctor shouted up after 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The 
                smell was so strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to 
                pause and collect his strength before he could go on. A door opened 
                to the right, and an emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot 
                and in underclothing, limped out and, leaning against the doorpost, 
                looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing. 
                Glancing in at the door, Rostov saw that the sick and wounded 
                were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I go in and look?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is there to see?&quot; said the assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him 
                to go in, Rostov entered the soldiers' ward. The foul air, to 
                which he had already begun to get used in the corridor, was still 
                stronger here. It was a little different, more pungent, and one 
                felt that this was where it originated.</p>
              <p> 　　In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large 
                windows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads 
                to the walls, and leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them 
                were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers. Those 
                who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow 
                faces, and all looked intently at Rostov with the same expression 
                of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of another's health. Rostov 
                went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors 
                into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there. He stood 
                still, looking silently around. He had not at all expected such 
                a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the passage 
                on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge 
                by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms 
                and legs outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled 
                back so that only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and 
                arms which were still red, the veins stood out like cords. He 
                was knocking the back of his head against the floor, hoarsely 
                uttering some word which he kept repeating. Rostov listened and 
                made out the word. It was &quot;drink, drink, a drink!&quot; Rostov 
                glanced round, looking for someone who would put this man back 
                in his place and bring him water.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who looks after the sick here?&quot; he asked the assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came 
                in from the next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front 
                of Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good day, your honor!&quot; he shouted, rolling his 
                eyes at Rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital 
                authorities.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get him to his place and give him some water,&quot; 
                said Rostov, pointing to the Cossack.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; the soldier replied complacently, 
                and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, 
                but did not move.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it's impossible to do anything here,&quot; thought 
                Rostov, lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware 
                of an intense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close 
                to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded 
                soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes 
                intently fixed on Rostov. The man's neighbor on one side whispered 
                something to him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed that the old 
                man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old 
                man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated 
                above the knee. His neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless 
                some distance from him with his head thrown back, was a young 
                soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled 
                and his eyes were rolled back. Rostov looked at the young soldier 
                and a cold chill ran down his back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, this one seems...&quot; he began, turning to the 
                assistant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how we've been begging, your honor,&quot; said the 
                old soldier, his jaw quivering. &quot;He's been dead since morning. 
                After all we're men, not dogs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll send someone at once. He shall be taken away- taken 
                away at once,&quot; said the assistant hurriedly. &quot;Let us 
                go, your honor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, let us go,&quot; said Rostov hastily, and 
                lowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between 
                the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, 
                and went out of the room. </p>

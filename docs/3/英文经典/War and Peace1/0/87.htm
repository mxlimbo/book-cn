              <p> 　　On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his 
                arrival, he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas 
                a Kempis, whose book had been sent him by someone unknown. One 
                thing he continually realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto 
                unknown to him, of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, 
                and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men, which 
                Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, 
                the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly 
                in Petersburg society, came into his room one evening in the official 
                and ceremonious manner in which Dolokhov's second had called on 
                him, and, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself 
                that there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,&quot; 
                he said without sitting down. &quot;A person of very high standing 
                in our Brotherhood has made application for you to be received 
                into our Order before the usual term and has proposed to me to 
                be your sponsor. I consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person's 
                wishes. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under 
                my sponsorship?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always 
                before met at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most 
                brilliant women, surprised Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I do wish it,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Willarski bowed his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One more question, Count,&quot; he said, &quot;which 
                beg you to answer in all sincerity- not as a future Mason but 
                as an honest man: have you renounced your former convictions- 
                do you believe in God?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre considered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... yes, I believe in God,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In that case...&quot; began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, I do believe in God,&quot; he repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In that case we can go,&quot; said Willarski. &quot;My 
                carriage is at your service.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre's inquiries 
                as to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only 
                replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that 
                Pierre had only to tell the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge 
                had its headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they 
                entered a small well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks 
                without the aid of a servant. From there they passed into another 
                room. A man in strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, 
                stepping toward him, said something to him in French in an undertone 
                and then went up to a small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments 
                such as he had never seen before. Having taken a kerchief from 
                the cupboard, Willarski bound Pierre's eyes with it and tied it 
                in a knot behind, catching some hairs painfully in the knot. Then 
                he drew his face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand 
                led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there 
                were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile. His huge 
                figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though smiling 
                face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whatever happens to you,&quot; he said, &quot;you must 
                bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.&quot; 
                (Pierre nodded affirmatively.) &quot;When you hear a knock at 
                the door, you will uncover your eyes,&quot; added Willarski. &quot;I 
                wish you courage and success,&quot; and, pressing Pierre's hand, 
                he went out.</p>
              <p> 　　Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or 
                twice he shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as 
                if wishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes 
                spent with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt 
                numb, his legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired 
                out. He experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt 
                afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing 
                his fear. He felt curious to know what was going to happen and 
                what would be revealed to him; but most of all, he felt joyful 
                that the moment had come when he would at last start on that path 
                of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he 
                had been dreaming since he met Joseph Alexeevich. Loud knocks 
                were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and 
                glanced around him. The room was in black darkness, only a small 
                lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer and 
                saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open 
                book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp 
                inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading 
                the first words of the Gospel: &quot;In the beginning was the 
                Word and the Word was with God,&quot; Pierre went round the table 
                and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin 
                with bones inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. 
                Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, 
                he expected everything to be unusual, even more unusual than what 
                he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel- it seemed to him 
                that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to stimulate 
                his emotions he looked around. &quot;God, death, love, the brotherhood 
                of man,&quot; he kept saying to himself, associating these words 
                with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came 
                in.</p>
              <p> 　　By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, 
                he saw rather short man. Having evidently come from the light 
                into the darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps 
                toward the table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.</p>
              <p> 　　This short man had on a white leather apron which covered 
                his chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above 
                which rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face 
                which was lit up from below.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For what have you come hither?&quot; asked the newcomer, 
                turning in Pierre's direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. 
                &quot;Why have you, who do not believe in the truth of the light 
                and who have not seen the light, come here? What do you seek from 
                us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre 
                felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced 
                in his boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence 
                of one socially a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through 
                the brotherhood of man. With bated breath and beating heart he 
                moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the brother who prepared 
                a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was known). Drawing 
                nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, Smolyaninov, 
                and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance- 
                he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor. For 
                a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had 
                to repeat his question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... I... I... desire regeneration,&quot; Pierre uttered 
                with difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well,&quot; said Smolyaninov, and went on at once: 
                &quot;Have you any idea of the means by which our holy Order will 
                help you to reach your aim?&quot; said he quietly and quickly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,&quot; 
                said Pierre, with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance 
                due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract 
                matters in Russian.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your conception of Freemasonry?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality 
                of men who have virtuous aims,&quot; said Pierre, feeling ashamed 
                of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, 
                as he spoke. &quot;I imagine...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good!&quot; said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied 
                with this answer. &quot;Have you sought for means of attaining 
                your aim in religion?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,&quot; 
                said Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked 
                him what he was saying. &quot;I have been an atheist,&quot; answered 
                Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws 
                in your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not 
                so?&quot; said the Rhetor, after a moment's pause.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; assented Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on 
                his breast, and began to speak.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,&quot; 
                he said, &quot;and if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter 
                our Brotherhood with profit. The first and chief object of our 
                Order, the foundation on which it rests and which no human power 
                can destroy, is the preservation and handing on to posterity of 
                a certain important mystery... which has come down to us from 
                the remotest ages, even from the first man- a mystery on which 
                perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is 
                of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared 
                by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope 
                to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing 
                our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify 
                and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition 
                from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby 
                to render them capable of receiving it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, 
                to improve the whole human race, offering it in our members an 
                example of piety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might 
                to combat the evil which sways the world. Think this over and 
                I will come to you again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To combat the evil which sways the world...&quot; Pierre 
                repeated, and a mental image of his future activity in this direction 
                rose in his mind. He imagined men such as he had himself been 
                a fortnight ago, and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them. 
                He imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he 
                would assist by word and deed, imagined oppressors whose victims 
                he would rescue. Of the three objects mentioned by the Rhetor, 
                this last, that of improving mankind, especially appealed to Pierre. 
                The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused 
                his curiosity, did not seem to him essential, and the second aim, 
                that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not much interest 
                him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already 
                perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all that 
                was good.</p>
              <p> 　　Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker 
                of the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon's 
                temple, which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These 
                virtues were:</p>
              <p>　　1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. </p>
              <p>　　2. Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order.</p>
              <p>　　3. Morality.</p>
              <p>　　4. Love of mankind.</p>
              <p>　　5. Courage.</p>
              <p>　　6. Generosity.</p>
              <p>　　7. The love of death.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of 
                death,&quot; the Rhetor said, &quot;to bring yourself to regard 
                it not as a dreaded foe, but as a friend that frees the soul grown 
                weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life, and 
                leads it to its place of recompense and peace.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that must be so,&quot; thought Pierre, when after 
                these words the Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. 
                &quot;It must be so, but I am still so weak that I love my life, 
                the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me.&quot; 
                But five of the other virtues which Pierre recalled, counting 
                them on his fingers, he felt already in his soul: courage, generosity, 
                morality, love of mankind, and especially obedience- which did 
                not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad 
                to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to 
                those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh 
                virtue was and could not recall it.</p>
              <p> 　　The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked 
                Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and determined 
                to submit to all that would be required of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am ready for everything,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I must also inform you,&quot; said the Rhetor, &quot;that 
                our Order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by 
                other means, which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere 
                seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words. This chamber with 
                what you see therein should already have suggested to your heart, 
                if it is sincere, more than words could do. You will perhaps also 
                see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment. 
                Our Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their 
                teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,&quot; said the Rhetor, 
                &quot;is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but 
                which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not 
                speak. He listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all 
                he said that his ordeal was about to begin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,&quot; 
                said the Rhetor coming closer to Pierre. &quot;In token of generosity 
                I ask you to give me all your valuables.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I have nothing here,&quot; replied Pierre, supposing 
                that he was asked to give up all he possessed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What you have with you: watch, money, rings....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not 
                manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. 
                When that had been done, the Rhetor said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according 
                to the Rhetor's instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from 
                Pierre's left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg 
                of his trousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking 
                off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser 
                leg to save this stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him 
                that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. 
                With a childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-derision, 
                which appeared on his face against his will, Pierre stood with 
                his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his brother Rhetor, 
                and awaited his further commands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to 
                me your chief passion,&quot; said the latter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My passion! I have had so many,&quot; replied Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That passion which more than all others caused you to 
                waver on the path of virtue,&quot; said the Mason.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre paused, seeking a reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? 
                Women?&quot; He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to 
                which of them to give the pre-eminence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Women,&quot; he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.</p>
              <p> 　　The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after 
                this answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief 
                that lay on the table, again bound his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For the last time I say to you- turn all your attention 
                upon yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, 
                not in passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness 
                is not without us but within....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing 
                source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.</p>

              <p> 　　After Prince Andrews engagement to Natasha, Pierre without 
                any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living 
                as before. Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to 
                him by his benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting 
                his inner man, to which he had devoted himself with such ardor- 
                all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of Andrew 
                and Natasha and the death of Joseph Alexeevich, the news of which 
                reached him almost at the same time. Only the skeleton of life 
                remained: his house, a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors 
                of a very important personage, acquaintance with all Petersburg, 
                and his court service with its dull formalities. And this life 
                suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keeping 
                a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going to the 
                Club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch with 
                the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess Helene 
                thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre 
                felt that she right, and to avoid compromising her went away to 
                Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the 
                faded and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; 
                as soon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine 
                with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the 
                icons, the Kremlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, 
                the sleigh drivers and hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old 
                Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending 
                their days leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the 
                Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself at home in 
                a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty 
                as in an old dressing gown.</p>
              <p> 　　Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received 
                Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready 
                awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, 
                most intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a 
                heedless, genial nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was 
                always empty because it was open to everyone.</p>
              <p> 　　Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies, 
                gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons, 
                churches, and books- no one and nothing met with a refusal from 
                him, and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large 
                sums from him and taken him under their protection, he would have 
                given everything away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the 
                Club without him. As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa 
                after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and talking, disputing, 
                and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly smile and 
                well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic dinners 
                were dull and dreary when he was not there.</p>
              <p> 　　When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and 
                kindly smile, yielding to the entreaties of the festive company 
                to drive off somewhere with them, shouts of delight and triumph 
                arose among the young men. At balls he danced if a partner was 
                needed. Young ladies, married and unmarried, liked him because 
                without making love to any of them, he was equally amiable to 
                all, especially after supper. &quot;Il est charmant; il n'a pas 
                de sexe,&quot;* they said of him. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;He is charming; he has no sex.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom 
                there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.</p>
              <p> 　　How horrified he would have been seven years before, when 
                he first arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was 
                no need for him to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long 
                been shaped, eternally predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, 
                he would be what all in his position were. He could not have believed 
                it! Had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish 
                a republic in Russia; then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be 
                a philosopher; and then a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? 
                Had he not seen the possibility of, and passionately desired, 
                the regeneration of the sinful human race, and his own progress 
                to the highest degree of perfection? Had he not established schools 
                and hospitals and liberated his serfs?</p>
              <p> 　　But instead of all that- here he was, the wealthy husband 
                of an unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of 
                eating and drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing 
                the government a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and 
                a universal favorite in Moscow society. For a long time he could 
                not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same 
                retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years 
                before.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was 
                only living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by 
                the thought of how many, like himself, had entered that life and 
                that Club temporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had 
                only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained.</p>
              <p> 　　In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed 
                to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other 
                retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were 
                empty, stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position, 
                &quot;while I am still discontented and want to do something for 
                mankind. But perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just 
                like me and sought something new, a path in life of their own, 
                and like me were brought by force of circumstances, society, and 
                race- by that elemental force against which man is powerless- 
                to the condition I am in,&quot; said he to himself in moments 
                of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer 
                despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his 
                comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and 
                disgust with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression 
                in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for 
                a moment. &quot;What for? Why? What is going on in the world?&quot; 
                he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily 
                beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; 
                but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these 
                questions he made haste to turn away from them, and took up a 
                book, or hurried of to the Club or to Apollon Nikolaevich's, to 
                exchange the gossip of the town.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Helene, who has never cared for anything but her own 
                body and is one of the stupidest women in the world,&quot; thought 
                Pierre, &quot;is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence 
                and refinement, and they pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte 
                was despised by all as long as he was great, but now that he has 
                become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants to offer 
                him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The Spaniards, through 
                the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over 
                the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through 
                the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth 
                of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear by 
                the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their 
                neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections 
                for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the 
                Manna Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a 
                charter that nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man 
                who wrote it does not understand. We all profess the Christian 
                law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the 
                law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty 
                churches- but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a 
                minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave 
                the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.&quot; So thought 
                Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone 
                accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time 
                as if it were something new. &quot;I understand the deception 
                and confusion,&quot; he thought, &quot;but how am I to tell them 
                all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they 
                too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only 
                try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I- what 
                is to become of me?&quot; thought he. He had the unfortunate capacity 
                many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and believing in 
                the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil 
                and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious 
                part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with 
                evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged 
                in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every 
                path of activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It 
                was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems, 
                so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget 
                them. He frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought 
                pictures, engaged in building, and above all- read.</p>
              <p> 　　He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming 
                home, while his valets were still taking off his things, he picked 
                up a book and began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, 
                from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the Club, from gossip 
                to carousals and women; from carousals back to gossip, reading, 
                and wine. Drinking became more and more a physical and also a 
                moral necessity. Though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence 
                wine was dangerous for him, he drank a great deal. He was only 
                quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically 
                into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body, an 
                amiability toward all his fellows, and a readiness to respond 
                superficially to every idea without probing it deeply. Only after 
                emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled 
                skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful 
                as he had thought. He was always conscious of some aspect of that 
                skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he 
                chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the influence 
                of wine he said to himself: &quot;It doesn't matter. I'll get 
                it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time now- I'll 
                think it all out later on!&quot; But the later on never came.</p>
              <p> 　　In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions 
                appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily 
                picked up a book, and if anyone came to see him he was glad.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in 
                war when entrenched under the enemy's fire, if they have nothing 
                to do, try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear 
                the danger. To Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking 
                refuge from life: some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing 
                laws, some in women, some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, 
                some in sport, some in wine, and some in governmental affairs. 
                &quot;Nothing is trivial, and nothing is important, it's all the 
                same- only to save oneself from it as best one can,&quot; thought 
                Pierre. &quot;Only not to see it, that dreadful it!&quot;</p>

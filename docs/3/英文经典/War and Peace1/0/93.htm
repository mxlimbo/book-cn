              <p> 　　Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, 
                and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French 
                idioms, he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure 
                and self-derision genuinely Russian. Bilibin wrote that the obligation 
                of diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have 
                in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour 
                out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being 
                done in the army. The letter was old, having been written before 
                the battle at Preussisch-Eylau.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,&quot; 
                wrote Bilibin, &quot;as you know, my dear prince, I never leave 
                headquarters. I have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it 
                is just as well for me; what I have seen during these last three 
                months is incredible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I begin ab ovo. 'The enemy of the human race,' as you 
                know, attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies 
                who have only betrayed us three times in three years. We take 
                up their cause, but it turns out that 'the enemy of the human 
                race' pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage 
                way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to 
                finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand 
                he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace 
                at Potsdam.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'I most ardently desire,' writes the King of Prussia 
                to Bonaparte, 'that Your Majesty should be received and treated 
                in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far 
                as circumstances allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to 
                that end. May I have succeeded!' The Prussian generals pride themselves 
                on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first 
                demand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand 
                men, asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned 
                to surrender.... All this is absolutely true.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike 
                attitude, it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and 
                what is more, in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King 
                of Prussia. We have everything in perfect order, only one little 
                thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief. As it was considered 
                that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had 
                the commander in chief not been so young, all our octogenarians 
                were reviewed, and of Prozorovski and Kamenski the latter was 
                preferred. The general comes to us, Suvorov-like, in a kibitka, 
                and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. 
                The mails are taken to the field marshal's room, for he likes 
                to do everything himself. I am called in to help sort the letters 
                and take those meant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits 
                for letters addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. 
                The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and 
                finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. 
                Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone 
                and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those 
                from the Emperor addressed to others. 'Ah! So that's the way they 
                treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! 
                Very well then! Get along with you!' So he writes the famous order 
                of the day to General Bennigsen:</p>
              <p> 　　'I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command 
                the army. You have brought your army corps to Pultusk, routed: 
                here it is exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must 
                be done, and, as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday, 
                you must think of retreating to our frontier- which do today.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'From all my riding,' he writes to the Emperor, 'I have 
                got a saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, 
                quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I 
                have passed on the command to the general next in seniority, Count 
                Buxhowden, having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs 
                to it, advising him if there is a lack of bread, to move farther 
                into the interior of Prussia, for only one day's ration of bread 
                remains, and in some regiments none at all, as reported by the 
                division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmoretzki, and all that the 
                peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital 
                at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly submit 
                my report, with the information that if the army remains in its 
                present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy 
                man left in it by spring.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old 
                man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill 
                the great and glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await 
                your most gracious permission here in hospital, that I may not 
                have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in 
                the army. My removal from the army does not produce the slightest 
                stir- a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in 
                Russia.'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes 
                us all, isn't it logical?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally 
                increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal's 
                departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and 
                must give battle. Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority, 
                but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly 
                as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and 
                he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle 'on his 
                own hand' as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of 
                Pultusk, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion 
                was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very 
                bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who 
                retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according 
                to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk. In short, we 
                retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with 
                news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from 
                Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his 
                victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden. 
                During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting 
                series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to 
                avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxhowden 
                who by right of seniority should be our chief. So energetically 
                do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river 
                we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who 
                at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden. General Buxhowden 
                was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as 
                a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. 
                Buxhowden pursues us- we scuttle. He hardly crosses the river 
                to our side before we recross to the other. At last our enemy. 
                Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry, and 
                the result is a challenge on Buxhowden's part and an epileptic 
                fit on Bennigsen's. But at the critical moment the courier who 
                carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns 
                bringing our appointment as commander in chief, and our first 
                foe, Buxhowden, is vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to 
                the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at that moment 
                a third enemy rises before us- namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, 
                loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The 
                stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting, 
                and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. 
                Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put 
                everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, 
                the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice 
                the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander 
                in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During one 
                of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my 
                dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of 
                divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear this will 
                oblige one half the army to shoot the other.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after 
                a while, in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was 
                safe to trust Bilibin), what he had read began to interest him 
                more and more. When he had read thus far, he crumpled the letter 
                up and threw it away. It was not what he had read that vexed him, 
                but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part 
                could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his forehead as if 
                to rid himself of all interest in what he had read, and listened 
                to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard 
                a strange noise through the door. He was seized with alarm lest 
                something should have happened to the child while he was reading 
                the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something 
                from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer 
                by the cot.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear,&quot; he heard what seemed to him her despairing 
                whisper behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, 
                he was seized by an unreasoning panic- it occurred to him that 
                the child was dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm 
                this terror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All is over,&quot; he thought, and a cold sweat broke 
                out on his forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that 
                he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the 
                dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened, 
                restless eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw him: the 
                rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his 
                head lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep 
                and breathing evenly.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if 
                he had already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had 
                taught him, tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. 
                The soft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with 
                his hand; even the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. 
                He was not dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was 
                convalescent. Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to 
                hold to his heart, this helpless little creature, but dared not 
                do so. He stood over him, gazing at his head and at the little 
                arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He heard a rustle 
                behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot. 
                He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant's face listened 
                to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary, who 
                had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, 
                and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her 
                without looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has perspired,&quot; said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was coming to tell you so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed 
                his forehead against the pillow.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the 
                curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from 
                the tears of joy that were in them. She leaned over to her brother 
                and kissed him, slightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each 
                made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light 
                beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion 
                where they three were shut off from all the world. Prince Andrew 
                was the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the muslin 
                of the curtain.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, this is the one thing left me now,&quot; he said 
                with a sigh. </p>

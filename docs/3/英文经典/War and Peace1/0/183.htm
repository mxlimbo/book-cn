              <p> 　　On receiving news of Natasha's illness, the countess, though 
                not quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Petya and 
                the rest of the household, and the whole family moved from Marya 
                Dmitrievna's house to their own and settled down in town.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha's illness was so serious that, fortunately for her 
                and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused 
                the illness, her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, 
                receded into the background. She was so ill that it was impossible 
                for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had 
                happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, 
                and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They could 
                not think of anything but how to help her. Doctors came to see 
                her singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, 
                and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety 
                of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple 
                idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the 
                disease Natasha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by 
                a live man can be known, for every living person has his own peculiarities 
                and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated 
                disease, unknown to medicine- not a disease of the lungs, liver, 
                skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but 
                a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of 
                the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur 
                to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable 
                to work his charms) because the business of their lives was to 
                cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best years 
                of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought 
                was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were 
                really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostov family. 
                Their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow 
                substances for the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, 
                as they were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, 
                and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the 
                invalid and of those who loved her- and that is why there are, 
                and always will be, pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and 
                allopaths. They satisfied that eternal human need for hope of 
                relief, for sympathy, and that something should be done, which 
                is felt by those who are suffering. They satisfied the need seen 
                in its most elementary form in a child, when it wants to have 
                a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself and runs 
                at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching 
                spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. 
                The child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its 
                people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and 
                the expression of its mother's sympathy while she rubs the bump 
                comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natasha because they kissed 
                and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon pass if only 
                the coachman went to the chemist's in the Arbat and got a powder 
                and some pills in a pretty box of a ruble and seventy kopeks, 
                and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of 
                precisely two hours, neither more nor less.</p>
              <p> 　　What would Sonya and the count and countess have done, how 
                would they have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had 
                not been those pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the 
                chicken cutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by 
                the doctors, the carrying out of which supplied an occupation 
                and consolation to the family circle? How would the count have 
                borne his dearly loved daughter's illness had he not known that 
                it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not grudge 
                thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her 
                illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and 
                would take her abroad for consultations there, and had he not 
                been able to explain the details of how Metivier and Feller had 
                not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and Mudrov had diagnosed 
                them even better? What would the countess have done had she not 
                been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying 
                the doctor's orders?</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You'll never get well like that,&quot; she would say, 
                forgetting her grief in her vexation, &quot;if you won't obey 
                the doctor and take your medicine at the right time! You mustn't 
                trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to pneumonia,&quot; she 
                would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of that 
                foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.</p>
              <p> 　　What would Sonya have done without the glad consciousness 
                that she had not undressed during the first three nights, in order 
                to be ready to carry out all the doctor's injunctions with precision, 
                and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper 
                time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had 
                to be administered? Even to Natasha herself it was pleasant to 
                see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and 
                to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours, though 
                she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all 
                nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding 
                the orders, that she did not believe in medical treatment and 
                did not value her life.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, 
                and regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But 
                when he had gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly 
                followed him, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking 
                his head said that though there was danger, he had hopes of the 
                effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see, that the 
                malady was chiefly mental, but... And the countess, trying to 
                conceal the action from herself and from him, slipped a gold coin 
                into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil 
                mind.</p>
              <p> 　　The symptoms of Natasha's illness were that she ate little, 
                slept little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors 
                said that she could not get on without medical treatment, so they 
                kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs 
                did not move to the country that summer of 1812.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and 
                powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss 
                who was fond of such things made a large collection, and in spite 
                of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, 
                youth prevailed. Natasha's grief began to be overlaid by the impressions 
                of daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it 
                gradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.

              <p> 　　Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas, who found that 
                they were so far from home that he accepted &quot;Uncle's&quot; 
                offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little 
                village of Mikhaylovna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And if you put up at my house that will be better still. 
                That's it, come on!&quot; said &quot;Uncle.&quot; &quot;You see 
                it's damp weather, and you could rest, and the little countess 
                could be driven home in a trap.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle's&quot; offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent 
                to Otradnoe for a trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya 
                to &quot;Uncle's&quot; house.</p>
              <p> 　　Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out 
                to the front porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, 
                old and young, as well as children, popped out from the back entrance 
                to have a look at the hunters who were arriving. The presence 
                of Natasha- a woman, a lady, and on horseback- raised the curiosity 
                of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her, 
                stared her in the face, and unabashed by her presence made remarks 
                about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human 
                being able to hear or understand what was said about her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Arinka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and 
                her skirt dangles.... See, she's got a little hunting horn!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Goodness gracious! See her knife?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Isn't she a Tartar!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is it you didn't go head over heels?&quot; asked 
                the boldest of all, addressing Natasha directly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; dismounted at the porch of his little wooden 
                house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after 
                a glance at his retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous 
                ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations 
                should be made to receive the guests and the visitors.</p>
              <p> 　　The serfs all dispersed. &quot;Uncle&quot; lifted Natasha 
                off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden 
                steps of the porch. The house, with its bare, unplastered log 
                walls, was not overclean- it did not seem that those living in 
                it aimed at keeping it spotless- but neither was it noticeably 
                neglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples, and 
                wolf and fox skins hung about.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; led the visitors through the anteroom into 
                a small hall with a folding table and red chairs, then into the 
                drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa, and finally 
                into his private room where there was a tattered sofa, a worn 
                carpet, and portraits of Suvorov, of the host's father and mother, 
                and of himself in military uniform. The study smelt strongly of 
                tobacco and dogs. &quot;Uncle&quot; asked his visitors to sit 
                down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room. 
                Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on 
                the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading 
                from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged 
                curtains could be seen. From behind this came women's laughter 
                and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas, and Petya took off their wraps 
                and sat down on the sofa. Petya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep 
                at once. Natasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces glowed, 
                they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another 
                (now that the hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas 
                no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority 
                over his sister), Natasha gave him a wink, and neither refrained 
                long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before 
                they had a pretext ready to account for it.</p>
              <p> 　　After a while &quot;Uncle&quot; came in, in a Cossack coat, 
                blue trousers, and small top boots. And Natasha felt that this 
                costume, the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement 
                at Otradnoe, was just the right thing and not at all worse than 
                a swallow-tail or frock coat. &quot;Uncle&quot; too was in high 
                spirits and far from being offended by the brother's and sister's 
                laughter (it could never enter his head that they might be laughing 
                at his way of life) he himself joined in the merriment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's right, young countess, that's it, come on! I 
                never saw anyone like her!&quot; said he, offering Nicholas a 
                pipe with a long stem and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, 
                taking down another that had been cut short. &quot;She's ridden 
                all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever!</p>
              <p> 　　Soon after &quot;Uncle's&quot; reappearance the door was opened, 
                evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, 
                good-looking woman of about forty, with a double chin and full 
                red lips, entered carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable 
                dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion, she 
                looked at the visitors and, with a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. 
                In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which caused her to protrude 
                her chest and stomach and throw back her head, this woman (who 
                was &quot;Uncle's&quot; housekeeper) trod very lightly. She went 
                to the table, set down the tray, and with her plump white hands 
                deftly took from it the bottles and various hors d'oeuvres and 
                dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had finished, 
                she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her 
                face. &quot;Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand 'Uncle'?&quot; 
                her expression said to Rostov. How could one help understanding? 
                Not only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood the meaning of 
                his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly 
                puckered his lips when Anisya Fedorovna entered. On the tray was 
                a bottle of herb wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, 
                rye cakes made with buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead 
                and sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey 
                sweets. Afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, 
                preserves made with honey, and preserves made with sugar.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna's housekeeping, 
                gathered and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had 
                a smack of Anisya Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, 
                whiteness, and pleasant smiles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take this, little Lady-Countess!&quot; she kept saying, 
                as she offered Natasha first one thing and then another.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or 
                eaten such buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut 
                sweets, or such a chicken anywhere. Anisya Fedorovna left the 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　After supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostov and &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                talked of past and future hunts, of Rugay and Ilagin's dogs, while 
                Natasha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. 
                She tried several times to wake Petya that he might eat something, 
                but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up. Natasha 
                felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that 
                she only feared the trap would come for her too soon. After a 
                casual pause, such as often occurs when receiving friends for 
                the first time in one's own house, &quot;Uncle,&quot; answering 
                a thought that was in his visitors' mind, said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death 
                will come. That's it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm 
                anyone?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle's&quot; face was very significant and even handsome 
                as he said this. Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he 
                had heard about him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout 
                the whole province &quot;Uncle&quot; had the reputation of being 
                the most honorable and disinterested of cranks. They called him 
                in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor, confided 
                secrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts; 
                but he always persistently refused public appointments, passing 
                the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting 
                at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in summer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why don't you enter the service, Uncle?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That's 
                it, come on! I can't make head or tail of it. That's for you- 
                I haven't brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter- that's 
                it, come on! Open the door, there!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Why 
                have you shut it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room, 
                as they called the room for the hunt servants.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand 
                opened the door into the huntsmen's room, from which came the 
                clear sounds of a balalayka on which someone, who was evidently 
                a master of the art, was playing. Natasha had been listening to 
                those strains for some time and now went out into the passage 
                to hear better.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good 
                balalayka. I'm fond of it,&quot; said &quot;Uncle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmen's 
                room when &quot;Uncle&quot; returned from the chase. &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                was fond of such music.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How good! Really very good!&quot; said Nicholas with 
                some unintentional superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess 
                that the sounds pleased him very much.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very good?&quot; said Natasha reproachfully, noticing 
                her brother's tone. &quot;Not 'very good' it's simply delicious!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Just as &quot;Uncle's&quot; pickled mushrooms, honey, and 
                cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world, so also 
                that song, at that moment, seemed to her the acme of musical delight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;More, please, more!&quot; cried Natasha at the door 
                as soon as the balalayka ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced 
                thrumming the balalayka to the air of My Lady, with trills and 
                variations. &quot;Uncle&quot; sat listening, slightly smiling, 
                with his head on one side. The air was repeated a hundred times. 
                The balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were 
                thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary of it and 
                wished to hear it again and again. Anisya Fedorovna came in and 
                leaned her portly person against the doorpost.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You like listening?&quot; she said to Natasha, with 
                a smile extremely like &quot;Uncle's.&quot; &quot;That's a good 
                player of ours,&quot; she added.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He doesn't play that part right!&quot; said &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                suddenly, with an energetic gesture. &quot;Here he ought to burst 
                out- that's it, come on!- ought to burst out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you play then?&quot; asked Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; did not answer, but smiled.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all 
                right. I haven't touched it for a long time. That's it- come on! 
                I've given it up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill 
                her errand and brought back the guitar.</p>
              <p> 　　Without looking at anyone, &quot;Uncle&quot; blew the dust 
                off it and, tapping the case with his bony fingers, tuned the 
                guitar and settled himself in his armchair. He took the guitar 
                a little above the fingerboard, arching his left elbow with a 
                somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at Anisya Fedorovna, 
                struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then quietly, smoothly, 
                and confidently began playing in very slow time, not My Lady, 
                but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The tune, 
                played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the 
                hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in them the same kind 
                of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna's whole being. 
                Anisya Fedorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face 
                went laughing out of the room. &quot;Uncle&quot; continued to 
                play correctly, carefully, with energetic firmness, looking with 
                a changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna 
                had just stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one 
                side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song 
                grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as 
                he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!&quot; shouted Natasha 
                as soon as he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed 
                him. &quot;Nicholas, Nicholas!&quot; she said, turning to her 
                brother, as if asking him: &quot;What is it moves me so?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas too was greatly pleased by &quot;Uncle's&quot; playing, 
                and &quot;Uncle&quot; played the piece over again. Anisya Fedorovna's 
                smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces... 
              </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Fetching water clear and sweet,</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Stop, dear maiden, I entreat- played &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                once more, running his fingers skillfully over the strings, and 
                then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go on, Uncle dear,&quot; Natasha wailed in an imploring 
                tone as if her life depended on it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; rose, and it was as if there were two men 
                in him: one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while 
                the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory 
                to a folk dance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now then, niece!&quot; he exclaimed, waving to Natasha 
                the hand that had just struck a chord.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward 
                to face &quot;Uncle,&quot; and setting her arms akimbo also made 
                a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by 
                an emigree French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she 
                breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de 
                chale* would, one would have supposed, long ago have effaced? 
                But the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable 
                Russian ones that &quot;Uncle&quot; had expected of her. As soon 
                as she had struck her pose, and smiled triumphantly, proudly, 
                and with sly merriment, the fear that had at first seized Nicholas 
                and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an 
                end, and they were already admiring her. </p>
              <p> 　　*The French shawl dance. </p>
              <p> 　　She did the right thing with such precision, such complete 
                precision, that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the 
                handkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, 
                though she laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, 
                reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself, who 
                yet was able to understand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya's 
                father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, little countess; that's it- come on!&quot; cried 
                &quot;Uncle,&quot; with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. 
                &quot;Well done, niece! Now a fine young fellow must be found 
                as husband for you. That's it- come on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's chosen already,&quot; said Nicholas smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh?&quot; said &quot;Uncle&quot; in surprise, looking 
                inquiringly at Natasha, who nodded her head with a happy smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And such a one!&quot; she said. But as soon as she had 
                said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. &quot;What 
                did Nicholas' smile mean when he said 'chosen already'? Is he 
                glad of it or not? It is as if he thought my Bolkonski would not 
                approve of or understand our gaiety. But he would understand it 
                all. Where is he now?&quot; she thought, and her face suddenly 
                became serious. But this lasted only a second. &quot;Don't dare 
                to think about it,&quot; she said to herself, and sat down again 
                smilingly beside &quot;Uncle,&quot; begging him to play something 
                more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; played another song and a valse; then after 
                a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song: 
              </p>
              <p> 　　　　　　As 'twas growing dark last night</p>
              <p> 　　　　　　Fell the snow so soft and light... </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Uncle&quot; sang as peasants sing, with full and naive 
                conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words 
                and that the tune comes of itself, and that apart from the words 
                there is no tune, which exists only to give measure to the words. 
                As a result of this the unconsidered tune, like the song of a 
                bird, was extraordinarily good. Natasha was in ecstasies over 
                &quot;Uncle's&quot; singing. She resolved to give up learning 
                the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.</p>
              <p> 　　After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men, who had 
                been sent to look for them, arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya. 
                The count and countess did not know where they were and were very 
                anxious, said one of the men.</p>
              <p> 　　Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of 
                the two traps. Natasha and Nicholas got into the other. &quot;Uncle&quot; 
                wrapped Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new 
                tenderness. He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that 
                could not be crossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, 
                and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good-by, dear niece,&quot; his voice called out of the 
                darkness- not the voice Natasha had known previously, but the 
                one that had sung As 'twas growing dark last night.</p>
              <p> 　　In the village through which they passed there were red lights 
                and a cheerful smell of smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a darling Uncle is!&quot; said Natasha, when they 
                had come out onto the highroad.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Nicholas. &quot;You're not cold?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No. I'm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!&quot; 
                answered Natasha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained 
                silent a long while. The night was dark and damp. They could not 
                see the horses, but only heard them splashing through the unseen 
                mud.</p>
              <p> 　　What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so 
                eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of 
                life? How did they all find place in her? But she was very happy. 
                As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As 
                'twas growing dark last night- the tune of which she had all the 
                way been trying to get and had at last caught.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Got it?&quot; said Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?&quot; 
                inquired Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　They were fond of asking one another that question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I?&quot; said Nicholas, trying to remember. &quot;Well, 
                you see, first I thought that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, 
                and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, 
                if not for his riding, then for his manner. What a good fellow 
                Uncle is! Don't you think so?... Well, and you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we 
                are driving along and imagining that we are going home, but that 
                heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness, and that 
                we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe, 
                but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No, nothing else.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know, I expect you thought of him,&quot; said Nicholas, 
                smiling as Natasha knew by the sound of his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; said Natasha, though she had in reality been 
                thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, 
                and of how he would have liked &quot;Uncle.&quot; &quot;And then 
                I was saying to myself all the way, 'How well Anisya carried herself, 
                how well!'&quot; And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy, ringing 
                laughter. &quot;And do you know,&quot; she suddenly said, &quot;I 
                know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am 
                now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!&quot; exclaimed Nicholas, 
                and he thought: &quot;How charming this Natasha of mine is! I 
                have no other friend like her and never shall have. Why should 
                she marry? We might always drive about together!</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!&quot; thought 
                Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, there are still lights in the drawingroom!&quot; 
                she said, pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly 
                in the moist velvety darkness of the night.</p>

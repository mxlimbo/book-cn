              <p> 　　Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for 
                himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous 
                conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count 
                Rostov's was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman 
                to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying 
                as usual at his father's house. Though he expected that the story 
                of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the 
                ladies about his father- who were never favorably disposed toward 
                him- would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless 
                on the day of his arrival went to his father's part of the house. 
                Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of 
                their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at 
                embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest 
                who was reading- the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna. The two 
                younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and 
                they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which 
                made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse 
                or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently 
                stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely 
                the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, 
                who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame 
                to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. 
                She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to 
                refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How do you do, cousin?&quot; said Pierre. &quot;You 
                don't recognize me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I recognize you only too well, too well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is the count? Can I see him?&quot; asked Pierre, 
                awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The count is suffering physically and mentally, and 
                apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can I see the count?&quot; Pierre again asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, 
                you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is 
                ready- it is almost time,&quot; she added, giving Pierre to understand 
                that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while 
                evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.</p>
              <p> 　　Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he 
                bowed and said: &quot;Then I will go to my rooms. You will let 
                me know when I can see him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter 
                of the sister with the mole.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count's 
                house. He sent for Pierre and said to him: &quot;My dear fellow, 
                if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you 
                will end very badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count 
                is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the 
                whole time in his rooms upstairs.</p>
              <p> 　　When Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down 
                his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures 
                at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and 
                glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming 
                his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders 
                and gesticulating.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;England is done for,&quot; said he, scowling and pointing 
                his finger at someone unseen. &quot;Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to 
                the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to...&quot; 
                But before Pierre- who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon 
                in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of 
                the Straits of Dover and captured London- could pronounce Pitt's 
                sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering 
                his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Boris was a boy 
                of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive 
                and hearty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you remember me?&quot; asked Boris quietly with a 
                pleasant smile. &quot;I have come with my mother to see the count, 
                but it seems he is not well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing 
                him,&quot; answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young 
                man was.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider 
                it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the 
                least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today,&quot; 
                said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, Count Rostov!&quot; exclaimed Pierre joyfully. &quot;Then 
                you are his son, Ilya? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first. 
                Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... 
                It's such an age...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are mistaken,&quot; said Boris deliberately, with 
                a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. &quot;I am Boris, son of 
                Princess Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is 
                Ilya, and his son is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes 
                or bees.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything 
                up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of 
                course. Well, now we know where we are. And what do you think 
                of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you 
                know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedition 
                is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn't make a mess of things!</p>
              <p> 　　Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not 
                read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's 
                name.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties 
                and scandal than with politics,&quot; said he in his quiet ironical 
                tone. &quot;I know nothing about it and have not thought about 
                it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,&quot; he continued. &quot;Just 
                now they are talking about you and your father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his 
                companion's sake that the latter might say something he would 
                afterwards regret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, 
                looking straight into Pierre's eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,&quot; Boris 
                went on. &quot;Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave 
                his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely 
                hope he will...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it is all very horrid,&quot; interrupted Pierre, 
                &quot;very horrid.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently 
                say something disconcerting to himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And it must seem to you,&quot; said Boris flushing slightly, 
                but not changing his tone or attitude, &quot;it must seem to you 
                that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it does,&quot; thought Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, 
                that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among 
                such people. We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, 
                for the very reason that your father is rich, I don't regard myself 
                as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask 
                or take anything from him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, 
                he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his 
                quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to 
                speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could 
                think?... I know very well...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Boris again interrupted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not 
                like it? You must excuse me,&quot; said he, putting Pierre at 
                ease instead of being put at ease by him, &quot;but I hope I have 
                not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, 
                what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostovs'?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Boris, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous 
                duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed 
                another in it, became quite pleasant again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but I say,&quot; said Pierre, calming down, &quot;you 
                are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very 
                good. Of course you don't know me. We have not met for such a 
                long time... not since we were children. You might think that 
                I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have done it 
                myself, I should not have had the courage, but it's splendid. 
                I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It's queer,&quot; 
                he added after a pause, &quot;that you should have suspected me!&quot; 
                He began to laugh. &quot;Well, what of it! I hope we'll get better 
                acquainted,&quot; and he pressed Boris' hand. &quot;Do you know, 
                I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for 
                me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army 
                across?&quot; asked Boris with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being 
                of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages 
                of the Boulogne expedition.</p>
              <p> 　　A footman came in to summon Boris- the princess was going. 
                Pierre, in order to make Boris' better acquaintance, promised 
                to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately 
                over his spectacles into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre 
                continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer 
                piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling 
                at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute 
                young man.</p>
              <p> 　　As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads 
                a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young 
                man and made up his mind that they would be friends.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief 
                to her eyes and her face was tearful.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is dreadful, dreadful!&quot; she was saying, &quot;but 
                cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend 
                the night. He must not be left like this. Every moment is precious. 
                I can't think why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God will help 
                me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support 
                you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Adieu, ma bonne,&quot; answered Prince Vasili turning 
                away from her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, he is in a dreadful state,&quot; said the mother 
                to her son when they were in the carriage. &quot;He hardly recognizes 
                anybody.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand, Mamma- what is his attitude to Pierre?&quot; 
                asked the son.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends 
                on it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!&quot; exclaimed the mother.</p>

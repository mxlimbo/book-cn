              <p> 　　At that time, as always happens, the highest society that 
                met at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, 
                each with its own particular tone. The largest of these was the 
                French circle of the Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count 
                Rumyantsev and Caulaincourt. In this group Helene, as soon as 
                she had settled in Petersburg with her husband, took a very prominent 
                place. She was visited by the members of the French embassy and 
                by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect 
                and polished manners.</p>
              <p> 　　Helene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the 
                Emperors and had brought from there these connections with the 
                Napoleonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. 
                Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her: 
                &quot;C'est un superbe animal.&quot;* Her success as a beautiful 
                and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre, for she had become 
                even handsomer than before. What did surprise him was that during 
                these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation 
                &quot;d' une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.&quot;*[2] 
                The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. 
                Bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezukhova's 
                presence. To be received in the Countess Bezukhova's salon was 
                regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men read books before 
                attending Helene's evenings, to have something to say in her salon, 
                and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors, confided 
                diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way Helene was a power. 
                Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with 
                a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner 
                parties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. 
                At these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who 
                always expects his trick to be found out at any moment. But whether 
                because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon, 
                or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception, 
                at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene Bezukhova's reputation 
                as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that 
                she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody 
                would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a 
                profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;That's a superb animal.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　*[2] &quot;Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society 
                woman. He was that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband 
                who was in no one's way, and far from spoiling the high tone and 
                general impression of the drawing room, he served, by the contrast 
                he presented to her, as an advantageous background to his elegant 
                and tactful wife. Pierre during the last two years, as a result 
                of his continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere 
                contempt for all else, had acquired in his wife's circle, which 
                did not interest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and 
                benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired artificially 
                and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife's 
                drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, 
                equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to them 
                all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him 
                and, regardless of whether any &quot;gentlemen of the embassy&quot; 
                were present or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were 
                sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. 
                But the general opinion concerning the queer husband of &quot;the 
                most distinguished woman in Petersburg&quot; was so well established 
                that no one took his freaks seriously.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, 
                Boris Drubetskoy, who had already achieved great success in the 
                service, was the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household 
                since Helene's return from Erfurt. Helene spoke of him as &quot;mon 
                page&quot; and treated him like a child. Her smile for him was 
                the same as for everybody, but sometimes that smile made Pierre 
                uncomfortable. Toward him Boris behaved with a particularly dignified 
                and sad deference. This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre. 
                He had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification 
                to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself 
                from the danger of its repetition, first by not being a husband 
                to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally 
                renounced her former infatuations,&quot; he told himself. &quot;There 
                has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away 
                by affairs of the heart&quot;- a statement which, though gathered 
                from an unknown source, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to 
                say Boris' presence in his wife's drawing room (and he was almost 
                always there) had a physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted 
                his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his 
                movements.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a strange antipathy,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;yet 
                I used to like him very much.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the 
                rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever 
                crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, 
                good-natured fellow. But a complex and difficult process of internal 
                development was taking place all this time in Pierre's soul, revealing 
                much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys. </p>

              <p> 　　Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian acquaintance 
                of his in the diplomatic service.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome 
                visitor,&quot; said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. 
                &quot;Franz, put the prince's things in my bedroom,&quot; said 
                he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski in. &quot;So you're 
                a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, 
                as you see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat's 
                luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilibin 
                settled down comfortably beside the fire.</p>
              <p> 　　After his journey and the campaign during which he had been 
                deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements 
                of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious 
                surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. 
                Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, 
                to speak if not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at 
                least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general 
                Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly 
                strong.</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same 
                circle as Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously 
                in Petersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew 
                was in Vienna with Kutuzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young 
                man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, 
                so to an even greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in 
                his diplomatic career. He still a young man but no longer a young 
                diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, 
                had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather important 
                post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in 
                Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats 
                who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, 
                avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those, 
                who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence 
                would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked 
                well whatever the import of his work. It was not the question 
                &quot;What for?&quot; but the question &quot;How?&quot; that interested 
                him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but 
                it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, 
                or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilibin's services 
                were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill 
                in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it 
                could be made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an 
                opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation 
                only when that was possible. His conversation was always sprinkled 
                with wittily original, finished phrases of general interest. These 
                sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a 
                portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society 
                people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, 
                in fact, Bilibin's witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese 
                drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered 
                important.</p>
              <p> 　　His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, 
                which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's 
                fingers after a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed 
                the principal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead 
                would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then 
                his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his 
                cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out 
                straight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now tell me about your exploits,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkonski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, 
                described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of 
                War.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They received me and my news as one receives a dog in 
                a game of skittles,&quot; said he in conclusion.</p>
              <p> 　　Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cependant, mon cher,&quot; he remarked, examining his 
                nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, 
                &quot;malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox 
                Russian army, j'avoue que votre victoire n'est pas des plus victorieuses.&quot;* 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox 
                Russian army, I must say that your victory was not particularly 
                victorious.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those 
                words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate 
                Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through 
                your fingers! Where's the victory?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But seriously,&quot; said Prince Andrew, &quot;we can 
                at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than 
                at Ulm...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because not everything happens as one expects or with 
                the smoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to 
                get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached 
                it by five in the afternoon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And why didn't you do it at seven in the morning? You 
                ought to have been there at seven in the morning,&quot; returned 
                Bilibin with a smile. &quot;You ought to have been there at seven 
                in the morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by 
                diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?&quot; 
                retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know,&quot; interrupted Bilibin, &quot;you're thinking 
                it's very easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! 
                That is true, but still why didn't you capture him? So don't be 
                surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August 
                Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by 
                your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy, 
                do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler, 
                or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater... True, we have 
                no Prater here...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled 
                his forehead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon cher,&quot; 
                said Bolkonski. &quot;I confess I do not understand: perhaps there 
                are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, 
                but I can't make it out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke 
                Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make 
                blunder after blunder. Kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory, 
                destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the 
                Minister of War does not even care to hear the details.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's just it, my dear fellow. You see it's hurrah 
                for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that 
                is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care 
                for your victories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke 
                Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke's as good as another, as you know) 
                and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte's, that 
                will be another story and we'll fire off some cannon! But this 
                sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl 
                does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon 
                Vienna, give up its defense- as much as to say: 'Heaven is with 
                us, but heaven help you and your capital!' The one general whom 
                we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate 
                us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours 
                could not have been conceived. It's as if it had been done on 
                purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant 
                victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect 
                would that have on the general course of events? It's too late 
                now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and 
                the count, our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, 
                and especially after having dined, Bolkonski felt that he could 
                not take in the full significance of the words he heard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,&quot; Bilibin 
                continued, &quot;and showed me a letter in which the parade of 
                the French in Vienna was fully described: Prince Murat et tout 
                le tremblement... You see that your victory is not a matter for 
                great rejoicing and that you can't be received as a savior.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really I don't care about that, I don't care at all,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the 
                battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of 
                such events as the fall of Austria's capital. &quot;How is it 
                Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead 
                and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was 
                defending Vienna?&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, 
                and is defending us- doing it very badly, I think, but still he 
                is defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge 
                has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined 
                and orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should 
                long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your 
                army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, 
                but they daren't say so. It will be as I said at the beginning 
                of the campaign, it won't be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, 
                or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter, but those who 
                devised it,&quot; said Bilibin quoting one of his own mots, releasing 
                the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. &quot;The only question 
                is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander 
                and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, 
                Austria's hand will be forced and there will be war. If not it 
                is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the 
                new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What an extraordinary genius!&quot; Prince Andrew suddenly 
                exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the table with 
                it, &quot;and what luck the man has!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Buonaparte?&quot; said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering 
                up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something 
                witty. &quot;Buonaparte?&quot; he repeated, accentuating the u: 
                &quot;I think, however, now that he lays down laws for Austria 
                at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l'u!* I shall certainly 
                adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;We must let him off the u!&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But joking apart,&quot; said Prince Andrew, &quot;do 
                you really think the campaign is over?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, 
                and she is not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been 
                fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged- 
                they say the Holy Russian army loots terribly- her army is destroyed, 
                her capital taken, and all this for the beaux yeux* of His Sardinian 
                Majesty. And therefore- this is between ourselves- I instinctively 
                feel that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations 
                with France and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*Fine eyes. </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible!&quot; cried Prince Andrew. &quot;That would 
                be too base.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If we live we shall see,&quot; replied Bilibin, his 
                face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was 
                at an end.</p>
              <p> 　　When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay 
                down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant 
                pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings 
                was far, far away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria's 
                treachery, Bonaparte's new triumph, tomorrow's levee and parade, 
                and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, 
                of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill 
                his ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers 
                were descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt 
                his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the 
                bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold 
                the joy of living, as he had not done since childhood.</p>
              <p> 　　He woke up...</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that all happened!&quot; he said, and, smiling 
                happily to himself like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful 
                slumber.</p>

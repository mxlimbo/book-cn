              <p> 　　Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov. As usual, 
                he ate and drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately 
                noticed that some great change had come over him that day. He 
                was silent all through dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, 
                or, with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, 
                kept rubbing the bridge of his nose. His face was depressed and 
                gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on 
                around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved 
                problem.</p>
              <p> 　　The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints 
                given by the princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dolokhov's 
                intimacy with his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received 
                that morning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous 
                letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that 
                his wife's connection with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but 
                himself. Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess' hints 
                and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dolokhov, who was 
                sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov's 
                handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous 
                rising in his soul and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling 
                his wife's past and her relations with Dolokhov, Pierre saw clearly 
                that what was said in the letter might be true, or might at least 
                seem to be true had it not referred to his wife. He involuntarily 
                remembered how Dolokhov, who had fully recovered his former position 
                after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. 
                Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon 
                companion, Dolokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre 
                had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how Helene 
                had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov's living at their 
                house, and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife's beauty 
                to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left 
                them for a day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, he is very handsome,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;and 
                I know him. It would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor 
                my name and ridicule me, just because I have exerted myself on 
                his behalf, befriended him, and helped him. I know and understand 
                what a spice that would add to the pleasure of deceiving me, if 
                it really were true. Yes, if it were true, but I do not believe 
                it. I have no right to, and can't, believe it.&quot; He remembered 
                the expression Dolokhov's face assumed in his moments of cruelty, 
                as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into 
                the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, 
                or shot a post-boy's horse with a pistol. That expression was 
                often on Dolokhov's face when looking at him. &quot;Yes, he is 
                a bully,&quot; thought Pierre, &quot;to kill a man means nothing 
                to him. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and 
                that must please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of 
                him- and in fact I am afraid of him,&quot; he thought, and again 
                he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. Dolokhov, 
                Denisov, and Rostov were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed 
                very gay. Rostov was talking <br>
                merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and 
                the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then 
                he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, 
                and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rostov 
                looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to 
                his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and 
                in a word- an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation 
                and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had not responded 
                to his greeting. When the Emperor's health was drunk, Pierre, 
                lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you about?&quot; shouted Rostov, looking at 
                him in an ecstasy of exasperation. &quot;Don't you hear it's His 
                Majesty the Emperor's health?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, 
                waiting till all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile 
                to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, I didn't recognize you!&quot; he said. But Rostov 
                was otherwise engaged; he was shouting &quot;Hurrah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why don't you renew the acquaintance?&quot; said Dolokhov 
                to Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Confound him, he's a fool!&quot; said Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,&quot; 
                said Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they 
                were talking about him. He reddened and turned away.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now to the health of handsome women!&quot; said 
                Dolokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking 
                at the corners of his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here's to the health of lovely women, Peterkin- and 
                their lovers!&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without 
                looking at Dolokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing 
                leaflets with Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before Pierre as one 
                of the principal guests. He was just going to take it when Dolokhov, 
                leaning across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. 
                Pierre looked at Dolokhov and his eyes dropped, the something 
                terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose 
                and took possession of him. He leaned his whole massive body across 
                the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How dare you take it?&quot; he shouted.</p>
              <p> 　　Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvitski 
                and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't! Don't! What are you about?&quot; whispered their 
                frightened voices.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, 
                and that smile of his which seemed to say, &quot;Ah! This is what 
                I like!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You shan't have it!&quot; he said distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!&quot; he 
                ejaculated, and, pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.</p>
              <p> 　　At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre 
                felt that the question of his wife's guilt which had been tormenting 
                him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the 
                affirmative. He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite 
                Denisov's request that he would take no part in the matter, Rostov 
                agreed to be Dolokhov's second, and after dinner he discussed 
                the arrangements for the duel with Nesvitski, Bezukhov's second. 
                Pierre went home, but Rostov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed 
                on at the Club till late, listening to the gypsies and other singers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, till tomorrow at Sokolniki,&quot;said Dolokhov, 
                as he took leave of Rostov in the Club porch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And do you feel quite calm?&quot; Rostov asked.</p>
              <p> 　　Dolokhov paused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you see, I'll tell you the whole secret of dueling 
                in two words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a 
                will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you 
                think you may be killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. 
                But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly 
                and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear 
                huntsman at Kostroma used to tell me. 'Everyone fears a bear,' 
                he says, 'but when you see one your fear's all gone, and your 
                only thought is not to let him get away!' And that's how it is 
                with me. A demain, mon cher.&quot;* </p>
              <p> 　　*Till tomorrow, my dear fellow. </p>
              <p> 　　Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drove 
                to the Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov 
                already there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations 
                which had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face 
                was yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about 
                distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. 
                He was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife's guilt, 
                of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, 
                and the guiltlessness of Dolokhov, who had no reason to preserve 
                the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... &quot;I should perhaps 
                have done the same thing in his place,&quot; thought Pierre. &quot;It's 
                even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, 
                this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the 
                head, or elbow, or knee. Can't I go away from here, run away, 
                bury myself somewhere?&quot; passed through his mind. But just 
                at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in 
                a particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the 
                respect of the onlookers, &quot;Will it be long? Are things ready?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the 
                barriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should not be doing my duty, Count,&quot; he said 
                in timid tones, &quot;and should not justify your confidence and 
                the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second, if 
                at this grave, this very grave, moment I did not tell you the 
                whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground for this affair, 
                or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right, not quite 
                in the right, you were impetuous...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure 
                your opponent will accept them,&quot; said Nesvitski (who like 
                the others concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar 
                cases, did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual 
                duel). &quot;You know, Count, it is much more honorable to admit 
                one's mistake than to let matters become irreparable. There was 
                no insult on either side. Allow me to convey....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No! What is there to talk about?&quot; said Pierre. 
                &quot;It's all the same.... Is everything ready?&quot; he added. 
                &quot;Only tell me where to go and where to shoot,&quot; he said 
                with an unnaturally gentle smile.</p>
              <p> 　　He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the 
                working of the trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in 
                his hand- a fact that he did not to confess.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,&quot; said 
                he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No apologies, none whatever,&quot; said Dolokhov to 
                Denisov (who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation), 
                and he also went up to the appointed place.</p>
              <p> 　　The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the 
                road, where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in 
                the pine forest covered with melting snow, the frost having begun 
                to break up during the last few days. The antagonists stood forty 
                paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing. The seconds, 
                measuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet snow between 
                the place where they had been standing and Nesvitski's and Dolokhov's 
                sabers, which were stuck intothe ground ten paces apart to mark 
                the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at forty paces' distance 
                nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had been ready, but 
                they still delayed and all were silent.</p>

              <p> 　　Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number 
                of carriages were standing outside the Sloboda Palace.</p>
              <p> 　　The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility 
                and gentry in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants 
                in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals. in the 
                noblemen's hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices. 
                The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table 
                under the portrait of the Emperor, but most of the gentry were 
                strolling about the room.</p>
              <p> 　　All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or 
                in their own houses, were in uniform- some in that of Catherine's 
                day, others in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms 
                of Alexander's time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and 
                the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something 
                strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities, 
                both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, 
                and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. 
                For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, 
                or, if they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone 
                younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Petya 
                had seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the 
                general expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the 
                everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaida 
                Dmitrievna's health, and so on.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a 
                nobleman's uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; 
                this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the 
                merchant-class- les etats generaux (States-General)- evoked in 
                him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were 
                deeply graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat social and 
                the French Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor's 
                appeal- that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation 
                with his people- strengthened this idea. And imagining that in 
                this direction something important which he had long awaited was 
                drawing near, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, 
                but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and 
                then all moved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics 
                of conversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals 
                of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a 
                ball should be given in the Emperor's honor, whether they should 
                group themselves by districts or by whole provinces... and so 
                on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the nobility 
                had been convened for, the talk became undecided and indefinite. 
                Then all preferred listening to speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of 
                a retired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and 
                a small crowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle 
                that had formed round the speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, 
                in a military uniform of Catherine's time, was sauntering with 
                a pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted. 
                He too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile 
                and nods of approval, as he always did, to what the speaker was 
                saying. The retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was 
                evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and 
                from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and 
                quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement 
                with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, 
                listened, and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, 
                but of views quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke 
                in a particularly sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone 
                voice, pleasantly swallowing his r's and generally slurring his 
                consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant, &quot;Heah! 
                Bwing me my pipe!&quot; It was indicative of dissipation and the 
                exercise of authority.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia 
                for the Empewah? Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte'n? If the 
                noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can 
                show its loyalty to our sov'weign the Empewah in other ways. Have 
                we fo'gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah 'seven? All 
                that did was to enwich the pwiests' sons and thieves and wobbahs....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Count Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at 
                all! It only wuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... 
                o' ou' men will wetu'n neithah soldiers no' peasants, and we'll 
                get only depwavity fwom them. The nobility don't gwudge theah 
                lives- evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and 
                the sov'weign&quot; (that was the way he referred to the Emperor) 
                &quot;need only say the word and we'll all die fo' him!&quot; 
                added the orator with animation.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostov's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, 
                but Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling 
                stirred, but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. 
                Scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man 
                without a tooth in his head, with a shrewd though angry expression, 
                standing near the first speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed 
                to managing debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in 
                low but distinct tones:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I imagine, sir,&quot; said he, mumbling with his toothless 
                mouth, &quot;that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether 
                it's best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription 
                or to call out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to 
                the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. 
                But to judge what is best- conscription or the militia- we can 
                leave to the supreme authority....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened 
                his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and 
                narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre 
                stepped forward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know 
                what he would say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally 
                lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, your excellency,&quot; he began. (He was 
                well acquainted with the senator, but thought it necessary on 
                this occasion to address him formally.) &quot;Though I don't agree 
                with the gentleman...&quot; (he hesitated: he wished to say, &quot;Mon 
                tres honorable preopinant&quot;- &quot;My very honorable opponent&quot;) 
                &quot;with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing, 
                I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express 
                their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by 
                which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,&quot; he went on, 
                warming to his subject, &quot;that the Emperor himself would not 
                be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are 
                willing to devote to his service, and chair a canon* we are ready 
                to make of ourselves- and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Food for cannon.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator's 
                sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre's remarks. Only Count 
                Rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those 
                of the naval officer, the senator, and in general with whatever 
                speech he had last heard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I think that before discussing these questions,&quot; 
                Pierre continued, &quot;we should ask the Emperor- most respectfully 
                ask His Majesty- to let us know the number of our troops and the 
                position in which our army and our forces now are, and then...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was 
                attacked from three sides. The most vigorous attack came from 
                an old acquaintance, a boston player who had always been well 
                disposed toward him, Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was 
                in uniform, and whether as a result of the uniform or from some 
                other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man. With 
                a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face, Adraksin 
                shouted at Pierre:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question 
                the Emperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility 
                had that right, the Emperor could not answer such a question. 
                The troops are moved according to the enemy's movements and the 
                number of men increases and decreases...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about 
                forty years of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies' 
                and knew as a bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his 
                uniform, came up to Pierre, interrupted Adraksin.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,&quot; he 
                continued, &quot;but for acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy 
                is advancing to destroy Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our 
                fathers, to carry off our wives and children.&quot; The nobleman 
                smote his breast. &quot;We will all arise, every one of us will 
                go, for our father the Tsar!&quot; he shouted, rolling his bloodshot 
                eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd. &quot;We 
                are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, 
                the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are 
                sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to 
                the defense of Russia!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt 
                that his words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less 
                audible than the sound of his opponent's voice.</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; 
                several persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the 
                end of a phrase, said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's right, quite right! Just so!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, 
                his serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs 
                in order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. 
                Many voices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count 
                Rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all, and the 
                group increased, dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum 
                of talk into the largest hall and to the big table. Not only was 
                Pierre's attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, 
                pushed aside, and people turned away from him as from a common 
                enemy. This happened not because they were displeased by the substance 
                of his speech, which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent 
                speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object 
                to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the latter. 
                Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in 
                the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.</p>
              <p> 　　Glinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized 
                (cries of &quot;author! author!&quot; were heard in the crowd), 
                said that &quot;hell must be repulsed by hell,&quot; and that 
                he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, 
                but &quot;we will not be that child.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!&quot; was repeated approvingly 
                in the back rows of the crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired 
                or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost 
                all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, 
                or playing boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices 
                the crowd advanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against 
                the high backs of the chairs, the orators spoke one after another 
                and sometimes two together. Those standing behind noticed what 
                a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it. Others in 
                that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and 
                hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat 
                and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their 
                faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found 
                it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire 
                to show that they were ready to go to all lengths- which found 
                expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of 
                the speeches- infected him too. He did not renounce his opinions, 
                but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I only said that it would be more to the purpose to 
                make sacrifices when we know what is needed!&quot; said he, trying 
                to be heard above the other voices.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention 
                was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of 
                the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!&quot; 
                shouted one man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is the enemy of mankind!&quot; cried another. &quot;Allow 
                me to speak....&quot; &quot;Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...&quot;

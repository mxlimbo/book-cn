          <tr> 
            <td> 　　The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre 
              continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead 
              with his small hand.
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us go and have supper,&quot; he said with a sigh, 
                going to the door.</p>
              <p> 　　They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining 
                room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, 
                and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households 
                of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned 
                his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation 
                such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk- 
                as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines 
                to speak out.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: 
                never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all 
                you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman 
                of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you 
                will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are 
                old and good for nothing- or all that is good and noble in you 
                will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! 
                Don't look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything 
                from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that 
                for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where 
                you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... 
                But what's the good?...&quot; and he waved his arm.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different 
                and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed 
                at his friend in amazement.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My wife,&quot; continued Prince Andrew, &quot;is an 
                excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man's honor 
                is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! 
                You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because 
                I like you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that 
                Bolkonski who had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with 
                half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. 
                Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; 
                his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now 
                flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless 
                he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in 
                these moments of almost morbid irritation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You don't understand why I say this,&quot; he continued, 
                &quot;but it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte 
                and his career,&quot; said he (though Pierre had not mentioned 
                Bonaparte), &quot;but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step 
                toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, 
                and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like 
                a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope 
                and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. 
                Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality- these are 
                the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the 
                war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am 
                fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,&quot; 
                continued Prince Andrew, &quot;and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen 
                to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, 
                and those women... If you only knew what those society women are, 
                and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, 
                trivial in everything- that's what women are when you see them 
                in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as 
                if there were something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, 
                nothing! No, don't marry, my dear fellow; don't marry!&quot; concluded 
                Prince Andrew.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It seems funny to me,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;that 
                you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled 
                life. You have everything before you, everything. And you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly 
                he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the 
                future.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How can he talk like that?&quot; thought Pierre. He 
                considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew 
                possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre 
                lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. 
                Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew's calm manner of 
                treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading 
                (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about 
                everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. 
                And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew's lack of capacity for 
                philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly 
                addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign 
                of strength.</p>
              <p> 　　Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of 
                life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is 
                necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My part is played out,&quot; said Prince Andrew. &quot;What's 
                the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,&quot; he added 
                after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what is there to say about me?&quot; said Pierre, 
                his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. &quot;What am 
                I? An illegitimate son!&quot; He suddenly blushed crimson, and 
                it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. &quot;Without 
                a name and without means... And it really...&quot; But he did 
                not say what &quot;it really&quot; was. &quot;For the present 
                I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least idea what 
                I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance- friendly 
                and affectionate as it was- expressed a sense of his own superiority.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live 
                man among our whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you 
                will; it's all the same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look 
                here: give up visiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of 
                life. It suits you so badly- all this debauchery, dissipation, 
                and the rest of it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What would you have, my dear fellow?&quot; answered 
                Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;Women, my dear fellow; 
                women!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't understand it,&quot; replied Prince Andrew. 
                &quot;Women who are comme il faut, that's a different matter; 
                but the Kuragins' set of women, 'women and wine' I don't understand!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing 
                the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were 
                planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know?&quot; said Pierre, as if suddenly struck 
                by a happy thought, &quot;seriously, I have long been thinking 
                of it.... Leading such a life I can't decide or think properly 
                about anything. One's head aches, and one spends all one's money. 
                He asked me for tonight, but I won't go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You give me your word of honor not to go?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On my honor!&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in camp 
                before Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two 
                Emperors- the Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived 
                from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning 
                were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz 
                by ten o'clock.</p>
              <p> 　　That day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris, telling 
                him that the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten 
                miles from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter 
                and money for him. Rostov was particularly in need of money now 
                that the troops, after their active service, were stationed near 
                Olmutz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and 
                Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares. The Pavlograds 
                held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for 
                the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain 
                Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there 
                with girls as waitresses. Rostov, who had just celebrated his 
                promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisov's horse, Bedouin, was 
                in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers. On receiving 
                Boris' letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz, dined there, 
                drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the Guards' 
                camp to find his old playmate. Rostov had not yet had time to 
                get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with 
                a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined 
                with worn leather, and an officer's saber with a sword knot. The 
                Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during 
                the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily 
                back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he thought 
                how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the Guards 
                by his appearance- that of a fighting hussar who had been under 
                fire.</p>
              <p> 　　The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure 
                trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline. They had come 
                by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian 
                authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at 
                every halting place. The regiments had entered and left the town 
                with their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke's orders the men 
                had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards 
                prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts. 
                Boris had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg 
                who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained 
                his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of 
                his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged 
                his money matters very satisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, 
                had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful 
                to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from 
                Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkonski, through 
                whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief's staff. 
                Berg and Boris, having rested after yesterday's march, were sitting, 
                clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters 
                allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between 
                his knees. Boris, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was 
                building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white 
                fingers while awaiting Berg's move, and watched his opponent's 
                face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only 
                of whatever he was engaged on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, how are you going to get out of that?&quot; he 
                remarked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We'll try to,&quot; replied Berg, touching a pawn and 
                then removing his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment the door opened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here he is at last!&quot; shouted Rostov. &quot;And 
                Berg too! Oh, you petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!&quot; he exclaimed, 
                imitating his Russian nurse's French, at which he and Boris used 
                to laugh long ago.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me, how you have changed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to 
                steady and replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about 
                to embrace his friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar 
                feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express 
                itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is 
                often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting 
                his friend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but 
                kiss him- a thing everybody did. But notwithstanding this, Boris 
                embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.</p>
              <p> 　　They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the 
                age when young men take their first steps on life's road, each 
                saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the 
                society in which they had taken those first steps. Both had changed 
                greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the 
                changes that had taken place in them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you'd 
                been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line,&quot; cried Rostov, 
                with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new 
                to Boris, pointing to his own mud-bespattered breeches. The German 
                landlady, hearing Rostov's loud voice, popped her head in at the 
                door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh, is she pretty?&quot; he asked with a wink.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them!&quot; said 
                Boris. &quot;I did not expect you today,&quot; he added. &quot;I 
                only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonski- an adjutant of 
                Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine. I did not think he would get 
                it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been under fire already?&quot; 
                asked Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　Without answering, Rostov shook the soldier's Cross of St. 
                George fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating 
                a bandaged arm, glanced at Berg with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As you see,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Indeed? Yes, yes!&quot; said Boris, with a smile. &quot;And 
                we too have had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His 
                Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that 
                we had every comfort and every advantage. What receptions we had 
                in Poland! What dinners and balls! I can't tell you. And the Tsarevich 
                was very gracious to all our officers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one 
                of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other 
                of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the 
                Imperial family.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, you Guards!&quot; said Rostov. &quot;I say, send 
                for some wine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Boris made a grimace.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you really want it,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, 
                and sent for wine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,&quot; 
                he added.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, 
                put both arms on the table and began to read. After reading a 
                few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, 
                hid his face behind the letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, they've sent you a tidy sum,&quot; said Berg, 
                eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa. &quot;As for us, 
                Count, we get along on our pay. I can tell you for myself...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say, Berg, my dear fellow,&quot; said Rostov, &quot;when 
                you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom 
                you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, 
                I'll go at once, to be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... 
                to the devil!&quot; he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him 
                by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing 
                to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, &quot;Don't be 
                hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an 
                old acquaintance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, don't mention it, Count! I quite understand,&quot; 
                said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go across to our hosts: they invited you,&quot; added 
                Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck 
                of dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on 
                his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, 
                and, having assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that 
                his coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh dear, what a beast I am!&quot; muttered Rostov, as 
                he read the letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have 
                given them such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!&quot; he repeated, 
                flushing suddenly. &quot;Well, have you sent Gabriel for some 
                wine? All right let's have some!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation 
                to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhaylovna's advice 
                had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking 
                him to take it to its destination and make use of it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What nonsense! Much I need it!&quot; said Rostov, throwing 
                the letter under the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why have you thrown that away?&quot; asked Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil 
                do I want it for!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why 'What the devil'?&quot; said Boris, picking it up 
                and reading the address. &quot;This letter would be of great use 
                to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not?&quot; inquired Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a lackey's job!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are still the same dreamer, I see,&quot; remarked 
                Boris, shaking his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you're still the same diplomatist! But that's not 
                the point... Come, how are you?&quot; asked Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, as you see. So far everything's all right, but 
                I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain 
                at the front.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because when once a man starts on military service, 
                he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, that's it!&quot; said Rostov, evidently thinking 
                of something else.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, 
                evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question.</p>
              <p> 　　Old Gabriel brought in the wine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shouldn't we now send for Berg?&quot; asked Boris. &quot;He 
                would drink with you. I can't.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that 
                German?&quot; asked Rostov, with a contemptuous smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,&quot; 
                answered Boris.</p>
              <p> 　　Again Rostov looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed. 
                Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between 
                the three officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostov 
                of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, 
                and abroad. They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, 
                the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility. 
                Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to 
                himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke's 
                quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed 
                to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the 
                regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With 
                a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up 
                to him in a violent passion, shouting: &quot;Arnauts!&quot; (&quot;Arnauts&quot; 
                was the Tsarevich's favorite expression when he was in a rage) 
                and called for the company commander.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, 
                because I knew I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may 
                say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations 
                as well as I do the Lord's Prayer. So, Count, there never is any 
                negligence in my company, and so my conscience was at ease. I 
                came forward....&quot; (Berg stood up and showed how he presented 
                himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would have been 
                difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency 
                than his did.) &quot;Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, 
                stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but 
                rather of death, as the saying is. 'Albanians!' and 'devils!' 
                and 'To Siberia!'&quot; said Berg with a sagacious smile. &quot;I 
                knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... 
                'Hey, are you dumb?' he shouted. Still I remained silent. And 
                what do you think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned 
                in the Orders of the Day. That's what keeping one's head means. 
                That's the way, Count,&quot; said Berg, lighting his pipe and 
                emitting rings of smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that was fine,&quot; said Rostov, smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, 
                and skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them 
                how and where he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he began 
                talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated. 
                He told them of his Schon Grabern affair, just as those who have 
                taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they 
                would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by 
                others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was. Rostov 
                was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate 
                lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it 
                happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he 
                lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers- 
                who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed 
                a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear 
                just such a story- they would either not have believed him or, 
                still worse, would have thought that Rostov was himself to blame 
                since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks 
                had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone 
                went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his 
                arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the 
                wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would 
                have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what 
                happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people 
                are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how 
                beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like 
                a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, 
                how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and 
                so on. And so he told them all that.</p>
              <p> 　　In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: &quot;You 
                cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an 
                attack,&quot; Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered 
                the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered 
                by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward 
                Boris, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished 
                to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers 
                from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to 
                find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line 
                recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure 
                that sort of man), he gave Boris a pleasant smile, frowned as 
                with half-closed eyes he looked at Rostov, bowed slightly and 
                wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant 
                to have dropped in on bad company. Rostov flushed up on noticing 
                this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, 
                however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar 
                of the line.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in 
                spite of the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army 
                point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff 
                of whom the newcomer was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, 
                blushed, and became silent. Boris inquired what news there might 
                be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask 
                about our plans.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall probably advance,&quot; replied Bolkonski, 
                evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, 
                as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies 
                would be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile 
                that he could give no opinion on such an important government 
                order, and Berg laughed gaily.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As to your business,&quot; Prince Andrew continued, 
                addressing Boris, &quot;we will talk of it later&quot; (and he 
                looked round at Rostov). &quot;Come to me after the review and 
                we will do what is possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to 
                Rostov, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now 
                changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: &quot;I 
                think you were talking of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was there,&quot; said Rostov angrily, as if intending 
                to insult the aide-de-camp.</p>
              <p> 　　Bolkonski noticed the hussar's state of mind, and it amused 
                him. With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: &quot;Yes, there 
                are many stories now told about that affair!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, stories!&quot; repeated Rostov loudly, looking 
                with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski. 
                &quot;Yes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men 
                who have been under the enemy's fire! Our stories have some weight, 
                not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards 
                without doing anything!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of whom you imagine me to be one?&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.</p>
              <p> 　　A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this 
                man's self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov's soul.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not talking about you,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't 
                know you and, frankly, I don't want to. I am speaking of the staff 
                in general.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I will tell you this,&quot; Prince Andrew interrupted 
                in a tone of quiet authority, &quot;you wish to insult me, and 
                I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do 
                so if you haven't sufficient self-respect, but admit that the 
                time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall 
                all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and 
                besides, Drubetskoy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is 
                not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease 
                you. However,&quot; he added rising, &quot;you know my name and 
                where to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either 
                myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older 
                than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday 
                after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskoy. Au revoir!&quot; 
                exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.</p>
              <p> 　　Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think of what 
                he ought to have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted 
                to say it. He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave 
                of Boris, rode home. Should he go to headquarters next day and 
                challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, 
                was the question that worried him all the way. He thought angrily 
                of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small 
                and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol, and then he 
                felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none 
                he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant 
                whom he so hated.</p>

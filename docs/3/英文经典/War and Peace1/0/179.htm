              <p> 　　Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostov had received 
                a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha's 
                illness and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew 
                (which they explained by Natasha's having rejected him) and again 
                asked Nicholas to retire from the army and return home. On receiving 
                this letter, Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave 
                of absence or to retire from the army, but wrote to his parents 
                that he was sorry Natasha was ill and her engagement broken off, 
                and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes. To Sonya 
                he wrote separately.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Adored friend of my soul!&quot; he wrote. &quot;Nothing 
                but honor could keep me from returning to the country. But now, 
                at the commencement of the campaign, I should feel dishonored, 
                not only in my comrades' eyes but in my own, if I preferred my 
                own happiness to my love and duty to the Fatherland. But this 
                shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly the war is 
                over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will throw 
                up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent 
                breast.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that 
                prevented Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying 
                Sonya. The autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting, and the winter 
                with the Christmas holidays and Sonya's love, had opened out to 
                him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never 
                known before, and which now allured him. &quot;A splendid wife, 
                children, a good pack of hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, 
                agriculture, neighbors, service by election...&quot; thought he. 
                But now the campaign was beginning, and he had to remain with 
                his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostov, as was 
                natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the regiment 
                and was able to find pleasure in that life.</p>
              <p> 　　On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully 
                welcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought 
                back from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned 
                him commendation from his commanders. During his absence he had 
                been promoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing 
                with an increase in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.</p>
              <p> 　　The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on 
                double pay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above 
                all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that 
                goes with the commencement of a war, and Rostov, conscious of 
                his advantageous position in the regiment, devoted himself entirely 
                to the pleasures and interests of military service, though he 
                knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them.</p>
              <p> 　　The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons 
                of state, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was 
                accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, 
                and passions at headquarters. For the Pavlograd hussars, however, 
                the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and 
                with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, 
                and intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves 
                where they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, 
                it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed 
                to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things 
                looked bad chanced to enter anyone's head, he tried to be as cheerful 
                as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend 
                of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they camped 
                gaily before Vilna, making acquaintance with the Polish landowners, 
                preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other 
                high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani and 
                destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them. Sventsyani 
                was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a name 
                the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many 
                complaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage 
                of the order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, 
                and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostov remembered Sventsyani, 
                because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he 
                changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken 
                men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five 
                barrels of old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther and 
                farther to Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near 
                to the frontier of Russia proper.</p>
              <p> 　　On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious 
                action for the first time.</p>
              <p> 　　On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was 
                a heavy storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 18l2 
                was remarkable for its storms.</p>
              <p> 　　The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of 
                rye, which was already in ear but had been completely trodden 
                down by cattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, 
                and Rostov, with a young officer named Ilyin, his protege, was 
                sitting in a hastily constructed shelter. An officer of their 
                regiment, with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after 
                riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered Rostov's 
                shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of 
                Raevski's exploit?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle, 
                which he had heard at the staff.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the 
                water trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an 
                occasional glance at Ilyin, who was pressing close to him. This 
                officer, a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, 
                was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been 
                to Denisov seven years before. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in 
                everything and adored him as a girl might have done.</p>
              <p> 　　Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently 
                of the Saltanov dam being &quot;a Russian Thermopylae,&quot; and 
                of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General 
                Raevski. He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the 
                dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him. 
                Rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage 
                Zdrzhinski's enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man 
                ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting 
                it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew 
                by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits, 
                as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he 
                had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all 
                as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's 
                tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches 
                extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, 
                as was his habit, and crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty. Rostov 
                looked at him in silence. &quot;In the first place, there must 
                have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being 
                attacked that if Raevski did lead his sons there, it could have 
                had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him,&quot; 
                thought he, &quot;the rest could not have seen how or with whom 
                Raevski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it would 
                not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with 
                Raevski's tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in 
                danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend 
                on whether they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are told was 
                the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? 
                And why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have 
                taken my brother Petya there, or even Ilyin, who's a stranger 
                to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere 
                under cover,&quot; Nicholas continued to think, as he listened 
                to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his thoughts, for in such 
                matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew that this tale 
                redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not 
                to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I can't stand this any more,&quot; said Ilyin, noticing 
                that Rostov did not relish Zdrzhinski's conversation. &quot;My 
                stockings and shirt... and the water is running on my seat! I'll 
                go and look for shelter. The rain seems less heavy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.</p>
              <p> 　　Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came 
                running back to the shanty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! About two 
                hundred yards away there's a tavern where ours have already gathered. 
                We can at least get dry there, and Mary Hendrikhovna's there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a 
                pretty young German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, 
                whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part 
                from his young wife in the early days of their marriage, took 
                her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy 
                had become a standing joke among the hussar officers.</p>
              <p> 　　Rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrushka 
                to follow with the things, and- now slipping in the mud, now splashing 
                right through it- set off with Ilyin in the lessening rain and 
                the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rostov, where are you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here. What lightning!&quot; they called to one another.

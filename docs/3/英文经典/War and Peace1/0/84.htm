              <p> 　　It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from music 
                as he did that day. But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle 
                than reality again presented itself. He got up without saying 
                a word and went downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour 
                later the old count came in from his Club, cheerful and contented. 
                Nicholas, hearing him drive up, went to meet him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well- had a good time?&quot; said the old count, smiling 
                gaily and proudly at his son.</p>
              <p> 　　Nicholas tried to say &quot;Yes,&quot; but could not: and 
                he nearly burst into sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and 
                did not notice his son's condition.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, it can't be avoided!&quot; thought Nicholas, for 
                the first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, 
                which made him feel ashamed feel of himself, he said, as if merely 
                asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly 
                forgetting. I need some money.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dear me!&quot; said his father, who was in a specially 
                good humor. &quot;I told you it would not be enough. How much?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very much,&quot; said Nicholas flushing, and with a 
                stupid careless smile, for which he was long unable to forgive 
                himself, &quot;I have lost a little, I mean a good deal, a great 
                deal- forty three thousand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What! To whom?... Nonsense!&quot; cried the count, suddenly 
                reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people 
                do.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I promised to pay tomorrow,&quot; said Nicholas.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well!...&quot; said the old count, spreading out his 
                arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It can't be helped It happens to everyone!&quot; said 
                the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he 
                regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could 
                not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father's hands 
                and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and 
                even rude voice, that it happens to everyone!</p>
              <p> 　　The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son's words 
                and began bustlingly searching for something.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he muttered, &quot;it will be difficult, 
                I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has 
                not done it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And with a furtive glance at his son's face, the count went 
                out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, 
                but had not at all expected this.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Papa! Pa-pa!&quot; he called after him, sobbing, &quot;forgive 
                me!&quot; And seizing his father's hand, he pressed it to his 
                lips and burst into tears.</p>
              <p> 　　While father and son were having their explanation, the mother 
                and daughter were having one not less important. Natasha came 
                running to her mother, quite excited.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Made what?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　The countess did not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. 
                To whom? To this chit of a girl, Natasha, who not so long ago 
                was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't, Natasha! What nonsense!&quot; she said, hoping 
                it was a joke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,&quot; said 
                Natasha indignantly. &quot;I come to ask you what to do, and you 
                call it 'nonsense!'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The countess shrugged her shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If it true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal, 
                tell him he is a fool, that's all!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he's not a fool!&quot; replied Natasha indignantly 
                and seriously.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, what do you want? You're all in love nowadays. 
                Well, if you are in love, marry him!&quot; said the countess, 
                with a laugh of annoyance. &quot;Good luck to you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I suppose I'm not 
                in love with him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, tell him so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mamma, are you cross? Don't be cross, dear! Is it my 
                fault?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and 
                tell him?&quot; said the countess smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It's 
                all very well for you,&quot; said Natasha, with a responsive smile. 
                &quot;You should have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean 
                to say it, but it came out accidently.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, all the same, you must refuse him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I mustn't. I am so sorry for him! He's so nice.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well then, accept his offer. It's high time for you 
                to be married,&quot; answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Mamma, but I'm so sorry for him. I don't know how 
                I'm to say it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And there's nothing for you to say. I shall speak to 
                him myself,&quot; said the countess, indignant that they should 
                have dared to treat this little Natasha as grown up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and 
                you'll listen at the door,&quot; and Natasha ran across the drawing 
                room to the dancing hall, where Denisov was sitting on the same 
                chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　He jumped up at the sound of her light step.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nataly,&quot; he said, moving with rapid steps toward 
                her, &quot;decide my fate. It is in your hands.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vasili Dmitrich, I'm so sorry for you!... No, but you 
                are so nice... but it won't do...not that... but as a friend, 
                I shall always love you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she 
                did not understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At 
                this instant, they heard the quick rustle of the countess' dress. 
                She came up to them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Vasili Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor,&quot; she 
                said, with an embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denisov- 
                &quot;but my daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son's 
                friend, you would have addressed yourself first to me. In that 
                case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Countess...&quot; said Denisov, with downcast eyes and 
                a guilty face. He tried to say more, but faltered.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. 
                She began to sob aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Countess, I have done w'ong,&quot; Denisov went on in 
                an unsteady voice, &quot;but believe me, I so adore your daughter 
                and all your family that I would give my life twice over...&quot; 
                He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe face said: &quot;Well, 
                good-by, Countess,&quot; and kissing her hand, he left the room 
                with quick resolute strides, without looking at Natasha. </p>
              <p> 　　Next day Rostov saw Denisov off. He not wish to stay another 
                day in Moscow. All Denisov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell 
                entertainment at the gypsies', with the result that he had no 
                recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three 
                stages of his journey.</p>
              <p> 　　After Denisov's departure, Rostov spent another fortnight 
                in Moscow, without going out of the house, waiting for the money 
                his father could not at once raise, and he spent most of his time 
                in the girls' room.</p>
              <p> 　　Sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was 
                as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement 
                that made her love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered 
                himself unworthy of her.</p>
              <p> 　　He filled the girls' albums with verses and music, and having 
                at last sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and 
                received his receipt, he left at the end of November, without 
                taking leave of any of his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment 
                which was already in Poland. </p>

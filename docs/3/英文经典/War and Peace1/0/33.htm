              <p> 　　That same evening there was an animated discussion among the 
                squadron's officers in Denisov's quarters.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I tell you, Rostov, that you must apologize to the 
                colonel!&quot; said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with 
                enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to 
                Rostov who was crimson with excitement.</p>
              <p> 　　The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to the 
                ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will allow no one to call me a liar!&quot; cried Rostov. 
                &quot;He told me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it 
                rests. He may keep me on duty every day, or may place me under 
                arrest, but no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander 
                of this regiment, thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, 
                then...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,&quot; 
                interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking 
                his long mustache. &quot;You tell the colonel in the presence 
                of other officers that an officer has stolen...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm not to blame that the conversation began in the 
                presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken 
                before them, but I am not a diplomatist. That's why I joined the 
                hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse; and he 
                tells me that I am lying- so let him give me satisfaction...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that's 
                not the point. Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question 
                for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to 
                the conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He 
                answered the staff captain's question by a disapproving shake 
                of his head.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before 
                other officers,&quot; continued the staff captain, &quot;and Bogdanich&quot; 
                (the colonel was called Bogdanich) &quot;shuts you up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to 
                him and must apologize.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not on any account!&quot; exclaimed Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did not expect this of you,&quot; said the staff captain 
                seriously and severely. &quot;You don't wish to apologize, but, 
                man, it's not only to him but to the whole regiment- all of us- 
                you're to blame all round. The case is this: you ought to have 
                thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go and blurt 
                it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel 
                to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? 
                Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that 
                how you look at it? We don't see it like that. And Bogdanich was 
                a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true. It's not 
                pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself 
                in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some 
                conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole 
                affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but 
                why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdanich 
                may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You're 
                quick at taking offense, but you don't mind disgracing the whole 
                regiment!&quot; The staff captain's voice began to tremble. &quot;You 
                have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you're here 
                today and tomorrow you'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and 
                can snap your fingers when it is said 'There are thieves among 
                the Pavlograd officers!' But it's not all the same to us! Am I 
                not right, Denisov? It's not the same!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally 
                looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You value your own pride and don't wish to apologize,&quot; 
                continued the staff captain, &quot;but we old fellows, who have 
                grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, 
                we prize the honor of the regiment, and Bogdanich knows it. Oh, 
                we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not right, it's not 
                right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother 
                truth. It's not right!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's twue, devil take it&quot; shouted Denisov, jumping 
                up. &quot;Now then, Wostov, now then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 Rostov, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at 
                one officer and then at the other.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, gentlemen, no... you mustn't think... I quite understand. 
                You're wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor 
                of the regiment I'd... Ah well, I'll show that in action, and 
                for me the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it's true I'm 
                to blame, to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, that's right, Count!&quot; cried the staff captain, 
                turning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I tell you,&quot; shouted Denisov, &quot;he's a fine 
                fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's better, Count,&quot; said the staff captain, 
                beginning to address Rostov by his title, as if in recognition 
                of his confession. &quot;Go and apologize, your excellency. Yes, 
                go!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Gentlemen, I'll do anything. No one shall hear a word 
                from me,&quot; said Rostov in an imploring voice, &quot;but I 
                can't apologize, by God I can't, do what you will! How can I go 
                and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Denisov began to laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It'll be worse for you. Bogdanich is vindictive and 
                you'll pay for your obstinacy,&quot; said Kirsten.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, on my word it's not obstinacy! I can't describe 
                the feeling. I can't...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, it's as you like,&quot; said the staff captain. 
                &quot;And what has become of that scoundrel?&quot; he asked Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off 
                the list tomowwow,&quot; muttered Denisov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is an illness, there's no other way of explaining 
                it,&quot; said the staff captain.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss my path. I'd kill 
                him!&quot; shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then Zherkov entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What brings you here?&quot; cried the officers turning 
                to the newcomer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We're to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered 
                with his whole army.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's not true!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've seen him myself!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such 
                news! But how did you come here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I've been sent back to the regiment all on account of 
                that devil, Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated 
                him on Mack's arrival... What's the matter, Rostov? You look as 
                if you'd just come out of a hot bath.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these 
                last two days.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought 
                by Zherkov. They were under orders to advance next day.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We're going into action, gentlemen!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, thank God! We've been sitting here too long!&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and 
                began to move about and talk, dressmakers came again. Marya Dmitrievna 
                appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natasha kept looking 
                uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept 
                every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same 
                as usual.</p>
              <p> 　　After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna 
                sat down in her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over 
                and this is my advice,&quot; she began. &quot;Yesterday, as you 
                know, I went to see Prince Bolkonski. Well, I had a talk with 
                him.... He took it into his head to begin shouting, but I am not 
                one to be shouted down. I said what I had to say!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, and he?&quot; asked the count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He? He's crazy... he did not want to listen. But what's 
                the use of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,&quot; 
                said Marya Dmitrievna. &quot;My advice to you is finish your business 
                and go back home to Otradnoe... and wait there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, no!&quot; exclaimed Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, go back,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, &quot;and 
                wait there. If your betrothed comes here now- there will be no 
                avoiding a quarrel; but alone with the old man he will talk things 
                over and then come on to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Count Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its 
                reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the 
                better to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if 
                not, the wedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at 
                Otradnoe.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see 
                him and took her,&quot; said the old count.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. 
                But if he won't- that's his affair,&quot; said Marya Dmitrievna, 
                looking for something in her reticule. &quot;Besides, the trousseau 
                is ready, so there is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready 
                I'll send after you. Though I don't like letting you go, it is 
                the best way. So go, with God's blessing!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she 
                handed it to Natasha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor 
                thing! She's afraid you might think that she does not like you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But she doesn't like me,&quot; said Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't talk nonsense!&quot; cried Marya Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shan't believe anyone, I know she doesn't like me,&quot; 
                replied Natasha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed 
                a cold and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look 
                at her more intently and to frown.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't answer like that, my good girl!&quot; she said. 
                &quot;What I say is true! Write an answer!&quot; Natasha did not 
                reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary's letter.</p>
              <p> 　　Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding 
                that had occurred between them. Whatever her father's feelings 
                might be, she begged Natasha to believe that she could not help 
                loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness 
                she was ready to sacrifice everything.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do not think, however,&quot; she wrote, &quot;that my 
                father is ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old 
                man who must be forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will 
                love her who makes his son happy.&quot; Princess Mary went on 
                to ask Natasha to fix a time when she could see her again.</p>
              <p> 　　After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table 
                to answer it. &quot;Dear Princess,&quot; she wrote in French quickly 
                and mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after 
                all that had happened the evening before? &quot;Yes, yes! All 
                that has happened, and now all is changed,&quot; she thought as 
                she sat with the letter she had begun before her. &quot;Must I 
                break off with him? Must I really? That's awful... and to escape 
                from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting 
                patterns with her.</p>
              <p> 　　After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess 
                Mary's letter. &quot;Can it be that it is all over?&quot; she 
                thought. &quot;Can it be that all this has happened so quickly 
                and has destroyed all that went before?&quot; She recalled her 
                love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength, and at the 
                same time felt that she loved Kuragin. She vividly pictured herself 
                as Prince Andrew's wife, and the scenes of happiness with him 
                she had so often repeated in her imagination, and at the same 
                time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of yesterday's 
                interview with Anatole.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why could that not be as well?&quot; she sometimes asked 
                herself in complete bewilderment. &quot;Only so could I be completely 
                happy; but now I have to choose, and I can't be happy without 
                either of them. Only,&quot; she thought, &quot;to tell Prince 
                Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally 
                impossible. But with that one nothing is spoiled. But am I really 
                to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew's love, in which I 
                have lived so long?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Please, Miss!&quot; whispered a maid entering the room 
                with a mysterious air. &quot;A man told me to give you this-&quot; 
                and she handed Natasha a letter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only, for Christ's sake...&quot; the girl went on, as 
                Natasha, without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read 
                a love letter from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, 
                she understood only that it was a letter from him- from the man 
                she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened 
                which had happened? And how could she have a love letter from 
                him in her hand?</p>
              <p> 　　With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter 
                which Dolokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she 
                found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to 
                be loved by you or to die. There is no other way for me,&quot; 
                the letter began. Then he went on to say that he knew her parents 
                would not give her to him- for this there were secret reasons 
                he could reveal only to her- but that if she loved him she need 
                only say the word yes, and no human power could hinder their bliss. 
                Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and carry her 
                off to the ends of the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, yes! I love him!&quot; thought Natasha, reading 
                the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly 
                deep meaning in each word of it.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs' and 
                proposed to take the girls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache, 
                remained at home. </p>

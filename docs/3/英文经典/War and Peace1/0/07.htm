            <td> 　　The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Prince 
              Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look 
              it had had in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet 
              from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for 
              a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose 
              and politely placed a chair for her.
              <p> 　　&quot;How is it,&quot; she began, as usual in French, settling 
                down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, &quot;how is it Annette 
                never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married 
                her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. 
                What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand 
                why he wants to go to the war,&quot; replied Pierre, addressing 
                the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown 
                by young men in their intercourse with young women.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess started. Evidently Pierre's words touched her 
                to the quick.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, that is just what I tell him!&quot; said she. &quot;I 
                don't understand it; I don't in the least understand why men can't 
                live without wars. How is it that we women don't want anything 
                of the kind, don't need it? Now you shall judge between us. I 
                always tell him: Here he is Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant 
                position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. 
                The other day at the Apraksins' I heard a lady asking, 'Is that 
                the famous Prince Andrew?' I did indeed.&quot; She laughed. &quot;He 
                is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp 
                to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. 
                Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you 
                think?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not 
                like the conversation, gave no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When are you starting?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it 
                spoken of,&quot; said the princess in the same petulantly playful 
                tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room 
                and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which 
                Pierre was almost a member. &quot;Today when I remembered that 
                all these delightful associations must be broken off... and then 
                you know, Andre...&quot; (she looked significantly at her husband) 
                &quot;I'm afraid, I'm afraid!&quot; she whispered, and a shudder 
                ran down her back.</p>
              <p> 　　Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone 
                besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her 
                in a tone of frigid politeness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand,&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! 
                Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves 
                me and locks me up alone in the country.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With my father and sister, remember,&quot; said Prince 
                Andrew gently.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects 
                me not to be afraid.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her 
                not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused 
                as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before 
                Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I still can't understand what you are afraid of,&quot; 
                said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.</p>
              <p> 　　The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of 
                despair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you 
                have...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,&quot; said 
                Prince Andrew. &quot;You had better go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip 
                quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked 
                about the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now 
                at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed 
                his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?&quot; 
                exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at 
                once distorted by a tearful grimace. &quot;I have long wanted 
                to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I 
                done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. 
                Why is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lise!&quot; was all Prince Andrew said. But that one 
                word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction 
                that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! 
                Did you behave like that six months ago?&quot; <br>
                　　&quot;Lise, I beg you to desist,&quot; said Prince Andrew still 
                more emphatically.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he 
                listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed 
                unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... 
                I assure you I myself have experienced... and so... because... 
                No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress 
                yourself... Good-by!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to 
                deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, he thinks only of himself,&quot; muttered the princess 
                without restraining her angry tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lise!&quot; said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice 
                to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess' 
                pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her 
                beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her 
                own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it 
                rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!&quot; she muttered, and lifting 
                her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed 
                him on the forehead.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good night, Lise,&quot; said he, rising and courteously 
                kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.</p>

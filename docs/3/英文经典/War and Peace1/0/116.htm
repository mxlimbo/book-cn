                it during that time: </p>
              <p> 　　24th November</p>
              <p> 　　Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. 
                [By Joseph Alexeevich's advice Pierre had entered the service 
                of the state and served on one of the committees.] Returned home 
                for dinner and dined alone- the countess had many visitors I do 
                not like. I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out 
                some passages for the Brothers. In the evening I went down to 
                the countess and told a funny story about B., and only remembered 
                that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly 
                at it.</p>
              <p> 　　I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, 
                help me to walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness 
                and deliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, 
                (3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service 
                of the state, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, 
                and the management of my affairs. </p>
              <p> 　　27th November</p>
              <p> 　　I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. 
                O God, help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read 
                the Scriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Urusov came 
                and we talked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor's 
                new projects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules 
                and my benefactor's words- that a true Freemason should be a zealous 
                worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker 
                when not called on to assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers 
                G. V. and O. visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the 
                reception of a new Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor. 
                I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpretation 
                of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven sciences, 
                the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the 
                Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the 
                admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises contributed 
                much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was Boris Drubetskoy 
                who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange 
                feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark 
                chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward 
                him which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really 
                like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, 
                but evil thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that 
                his object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate 
                and in favor with members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that 
                he had asked me several times whether N. and S. were members of 
                our lodge (a question to which I could not reply) and that according 
                to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy 
                order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man 
                to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to doubt him, 
                but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood alone 
                with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling 
                contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare 
                breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor 
                could I frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand 
                Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path 
                out of the labyrinth of lies! </p>
              <p> 　　 After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and 
                then the following was written: </p>
              <p> 　　I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother 
                V., who advised me to hold fast by brother A. Though I am unworthy, 
                much was revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of 
                the world. Elohim is the name of the ruler of all. The third name 
                is the name unutterable which means the All. Talks with Brother 
                V. strengthen, refresh, and support me in the path of virtue. 
                In his presence doubt has no place. The distinction between the 
                poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred all-embracing 
                teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect everything to 
                comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the holy 
                science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety 
                and life. The Trinity- the three elements of matter- are sulphur, 
                mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in 
                combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire 
                in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, 
                holds it, and in combination produces other bodies. Mercury is 
                a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the Holy Spirit, 
                Him!... </p>
              <p> 　　3rd December</p>
              <p> 　　Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards 
                went and paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, 
                but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years 
                ago, when Dolokhov, meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said 
                he hoped I was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's 
                absence. At the time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled every 
                detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent 
                and bitter replies. I recollected myself and drove away that thought 
                only when I found myself glowing with anger, but I did not sufficiently 
                repent. Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy came and began relating various 
                adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said something 
                disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that 
                was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected 
                myself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with 
                him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above 
                him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my 
                rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, 
                grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and 
                behave so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep 
                and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my 
                left ear, &quot;Thy day!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly 
                surrounded by dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish 
                dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go. 
                I began to throttle it with my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off 
                before another, a bigger one, began biting me. I lifted it up, 
                but the higher I lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew. And 
                suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led me to a building 
                to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank. I stepped 
                on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a fence 
                which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort 
                I dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and 
                my body on the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing 
                on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and 
                in the garden was a large and beautiful building. I woke up. O 
                Lord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear from myself these 
                dogs- my passions especially the last, which unites in itself 
                the strength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that 
                temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream. 
              </p>
              <p> 　　7th December</p>
              <p> 　　I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house, 
                and that I was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed 
                as if I chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered 
                that this could not please him, and I wished to come close to 
                him and embrace him. But as soon as I drew near I saw that his 
                face had changed and grown young, and he was quietly telling me 
                something about the teaching of our order, but so softly that 
                I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left the room 
                and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on the 
                floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my 
                sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing 
                to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying 
                me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. 
                But be looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off 
                his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he had been 
                saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind 
                look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where 
                there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned 
                with longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, &quot;Tell 
                me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think 
                you know it already.&quot; Abashed by this question, I replied 
                that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; 
                and even more abashed, I said that though I was living with my 
                wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. 
                To this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one's 
                embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But 
                I replied that I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything 
                vanished. And I awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: 
                &quot;The life was the light of men. And the light shineth in 
                darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.&quot; Joseph Alexeevich's 
                face had looked young and bright. That day I received a letter 
                from my benefactor in which he wrote about &quot;conjugal duties.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> 　　9th December</p>
              <p> 　　I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I 
                saw that I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, 
                and Joseph Alexeevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed 
                to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken 
                place in him, and I rushed to meet him. I embraced him and kissed 
                his hands, and he said, &quot;Hast thou noticed that my face is 
                different?&quot; I looked at him, still holding him in my arms, 
                and saw that his face was young, but that he had no hair on his 
                head and his features were quite changed. And I said, &quot;I 
                should have known you had I met you by chance,&quot; and I thought 
                to myself, &quot;Am I telling the truth?&quot; And suddenly I 
                saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered and 
                went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of 
                drawing paper; I said, &quot;I drew that,&quot; and he answered 
                by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on all the pages there 
                were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings 
                represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved. 
                And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden 
                in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up 
                to the clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing 
                else than a representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at 
                those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could 
                not tear myself away from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy 
                forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am myself 
                the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of my debauchery 
                if Thou utterly desertest me!</p>

              <p> 　　At eight o'clock Kutuzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the 
                fourth column, Miloradovich's, the one that was to take the place 
                of Przebyszewski's and Langeron's columns which had already gone 
                down into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment 
                and gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended 
                to lead that column himself. When he had reached the village of 
                Pratzen he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense 
                number forming the commander in chief's suite. He was in a state 
                of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm 
                as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment. He was firmly 
                convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of 
                Arcola. How it would come about he did not know, but he felt sure 
                it would do so. The locality and the position of our troops were 
                known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. 
                His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried 
                out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince 
                Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects 
                such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.</p>
              <p> 　　To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen 
                forces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the 
                fight would concentrate. &quot;There we shall encounter difficulties, 
                and there,&quot; thought he, &quot;I shall be sent with a brigade 
                or division, and there, standard in hand, I shall go forward and 
                break whatever is in front of me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions. 
                Seeing them he kept thinking, &quot;That may be the very standard 
                with which I shall lead the army.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the 
                heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys 
                it still lay like a milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the 
                valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from 
                whence came the sounds of firing. Above the heights was the dark 
                clear sky, and to the right the vast orb of the sun. In front, 
                far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded 
                hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, 
                for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were 
                entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and 
                now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village 
                similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of 
                mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The commander in chief 
                was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass 
                by him. That morning Kutuzov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry 
                passing before him came to a halt without any command being given, 
                apparently obstructed by something in front.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do order them to form into battalion columns and go 
                round the village!&quot; he said angrily to a general who had 
                ridden up. &quot;Don't you understand, your excellency, my dear 
                sir, that you must not defile through narrow village streets when 
                we are marching against the enemy?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your 
                excellency,&quot; answered the general.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov laughed bitterly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of 
                the enemy! Very fine!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According 
                to the dispositions...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The dispositions!&quot; exclaimed Kutuzov bitterly. 
                &quot;Who told you that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; Nesvitski whispered to Prince 
                Andrew, &quot;the old man is as surly as a dog.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in 
                his hat galloped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Emperor's name 
                had the fourth column advanced into action.</p>
              <p> 　　Kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened 
                to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutuzov's 
                malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that 
                what was being done was not his adjutant's fault, and still not 
                answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division 
                has passed the village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,&quot; 
                he added. &quot;What are they doing? What are they doing?&quot; 
                he murmured to himself, still not replying to the Austrian.</p>
              <p> 　　Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.</p>
              <p> 　　Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped 
                the third division and convinced himself that there really were 
                no sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head 
                of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief's 
                order to throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that 
                there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must 
                be at least six miles away. There was really nothing to be seen 
                in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having 
                given orders in the commander in chief's name to rectify this 
                omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutuzov still in the same 
                place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude 
                of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The troops were 
                no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets on 
                the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right, all right!&quot; he said to Prince Andrew, 
                and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was 
                time they started as all the left-flank columns had already descended.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Plenty of time, your excellency,&quot; muttered Kutuzov 
                in the midst of a yawn. &quot;Plenty of time,&quot; he repeated.</p>
              <p> 　　Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound 
                of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along 
                the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently 
                the person they were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers 
                of the regiment in front of which Kutuzov was standing began to 
                shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. 
                Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron 
                of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side 
                in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes 
                in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was 
                in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors 
                followed by their suites. Kutuzov, affecting the manners of an 
                old soldier at the front, gave the command &quot;Attention!&quot; 
                and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance 
                and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate 
                who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which 
                evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.</p>
              <p> 　　This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and 
                happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear 
                sky and vanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner that 
                day than on the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for 
                the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching 
                combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and 
                on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression 
                and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth.</p>
              <p> 　　At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; here he 
                seemed brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after 
                galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully 
                and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and animated 
                as his own. Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, 
                and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, 
                well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks 
                and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis, 
                a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black 
                horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. 
                He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question- 
                &quot;Most likely he is asking at what o'clock they started,&quot; 
                thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile 
                he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brunn. In 
                the Emperors' suite were the picked young orderly officers of 
                the Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them 
                were grooms leading the Tsar's beautiful relay horses covered 
                with embroidered cloths.</p>
              <p> 　　As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields 
                enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and 
                confidence of success reached Kutuzov's cheerless staff with the 
                galloping advent of all these brilliant young men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why aren't you beginning, Michael Ilarionovich?&quot; 
                said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzov, glancing courteously 
                at the same time at the Emperor Francis.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am waiting, Your Majesty,&quot; answered Kutuzov, 
                bending forward respectfully.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if 
                he had not quite heard.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Waiting, Your Majesty,&quot; repeated Kutuzov. (Prince 
                Andrew noted that Kutuzov's upper lip twitched unnaturally as 
                he said the word &quot;waiting.&quot;) &quot;Not all the columns 
                have formed up yet, Your Majesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged 
                his rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was 
                near him, as if complaining of Kutuzov.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not are not on 
                the Empress' Field where a parade does not begin till all the 
                troops are assembled,&quot; said the Tsar with another glance 
                at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to join in at 
                least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis 
                continued to look about him and did not listen.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is just why I do not begin, sire,&quot; said Kutuzov 
                in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility 
                of not being heard, and again something in his face twitched- 
                &quot;That is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not 
                on parade and not on the Empress' Field.&quot; said clearly and 
                distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed 
                dissatisfaction and reproach. &quot;Old though he may be, he should 
                not, he certainly should not, speak like that,&quot; their glances 
                seemed to say.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutuzov's eye 
                waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutuzov, 
                with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence 
                lasted for about a minute.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;However, if you command it, Your Majesty,&quot; said 
                Kutuzov, lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of 
                a dull, unreasoning, but submissive general.</p>
              <p> 　　He touched his horse and having called Miloradovich, the commander 
                of the column, gave him the order to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the 
                Novgorod and one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the 
                Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　As this Apsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Miloradovich, 
                without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous 
                tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners 
                front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing 
                salute reined in his horse before the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;God be with you, general!&quot; said the Emperor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite, 
                sire,&quot;* he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles 
                among the gentlemen of the Tsar's suite by his poor French. </p>
              <p> 　　*&quot;Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible 
                to do, Sire.&quot; </p>
              <p> 　　Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself 
                a little behind the Emperor. The Apsheron men, excited by the 
                Tsar's presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their 
                suites at a bold, brisk pace.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Lads!&quot; shouted Miloradovich in a loud, self-confident, 
                and cheery voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, 
                by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons, 
                his comrades in Suvorov's time, now passing so gallantly before 
                the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns' presence. &quot;Lads, 
                it's not the first village you've had to take,&quot; cried he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Glad to do our best!&quot; shouted the soldiers.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry. This horse 
                that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also 
                here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of 
                his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just 
                as it had done on the Empress' Field, not understanding the significance 
                of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis' black 
                cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day 
                by its rider.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and 
                made a remark to him, pointing to the gallant Apsherons.</p>

              <p> 　　That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs' to fulfill the 
                commission entrusted to him. Natasha was in bed, the count at 
                the Club, and Pierre, after giving the letters to Sonya, went 
                to Marya Dmitrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew 
                had taken the news. Ten minutes later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich,&quot; 
                said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there 
                has not been tidied up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,&quot; 
                said Sonya.</p>
              <p> 　　Marya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! 
                Now mind, don't tell her everything!&quot; said she to Pierre. 
                &quot;One hasn't the heart to scold her, she is so much to be 
                pitied, so much to be pitied.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, 
                with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected 
                to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently 
                undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her 
                hand as usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing 
                heavily, her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used 
                to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, 
                but with quite a different expression of face.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Peter Kirilovich,&quot; she began rapidly, &quot;Prince 
                Bolkonski was your friend- is your friend,&quot; she corrected 
                herself. (It seemed to her that everything that had once been 
                must now be different.) &quot;He told me once to apply to you...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till 
                then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, 
                but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his 
                soul for reproach.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!&quot; 
                She stopped and breathed still more quickly, but did not shed 
                tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes... I will tell him,&quot; answered Pierre; &quot;but...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know what to say.</p>
              <p> 　　Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might 
                think she had meant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, I know all is over,&quot; she said hurriedly. &quot;No, 
                that can never be. I'm only tormented by the wrong I have done 
                him. Tell him only that I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive 
                me for everything....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.</p>
              <p> 　　A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre's 
                heart.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,&quot; 
                said Pierre. &quot;But... I should like to know one thing....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Know what?&quot; Natasha's eyes asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should like to know, did you love...&quot; Pierre 
                did not know how to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought 
                of him- &quot;did you love that bad man?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't call him bad!&quot; said Natasha. &quot;But I 
                don't know, don't know at all....&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, 
                and love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under 
                his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We won't speak of it any more, my dear,&quot; said Pierre, 
                and his gentle, cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natasha.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We won't speak of it, my dear- I'll tell him everything; 
                but one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you 
                want help, advice, or simply to open your heart to someone- not 
                now, but when your mind is clearer think of me!&quot; He took 
                her hand and kissed it. &quot;I shall be happy if it's in my power...&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre grew confused.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't speak to me like that. I am not worth it!&quot; 
                exclaimed Natasha and turned to leave the room, but Pierre held 
                her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said 
                it he was amazed at his own words.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,&quot; 
                said he to her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Before me? No! All is over for me,&quot; she replied 
                with shame and self-abasement.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;All over?&quot; he repeated. &quot;If I were not myself, 
                but the handsomest, cleverest, and best man in the world, and 
                were free, I would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and 
                your love!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude 
                and tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, 
                restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without 
                finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into 
                his sleigh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where to now, your excellency?&quot; asked the coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where to?&quot; Pierre asked himself. &quot;Where can 
                I go now? Surely not to the Club or to pay calls?&quot; All men 
                seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison with this feeling of 
                tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison with that softened, 
                grateful, last look she had given him through her tears.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Home!&quot; said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees 
                of frost Fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his 
                broad chest and inhaled the air with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, 
                above the black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking 
                up at the sky did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating 
                were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his 
                soul had just been raised. At the entrance to the Arbat Square 
                an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his 
                eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the Prechistenka Boulevard, 
                surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished 
                from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light, and 
                its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet 
                of 18l2- the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes 
                and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with 
                its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary 
                he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet 
                which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity 
                through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly- like an arrow piercing 
                the earth- to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding 
                its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless 
                other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet 
                fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted 
                soul, now blossoming into a new life. </p>

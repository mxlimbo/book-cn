              <p> 　　The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vilna for more 
                than a month. reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing 
                was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for 
                which the Emperor had come from Petersburg. There was no general 
                plan of action. The vacillation between the various plans that 
                were proposed had even increased after the Emperor had been at 
                headquarters for a month. Each of the three armies had its own 
                commander in chief, but there was no supreme commander of all 
                the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody- 
                tired of waiting- prepare for the war. All the efforts of those 
                who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making 
                him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.</p>
              <p> 　　In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, 
                by the courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one 
                of the Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball 
                should be given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea 
                was eagerly received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp 
                collected money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be 
                most pleasing to the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count 
                Bennigsen, being a landowner in the Vilna province, offered his 
                country house for the fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed 
                for a ball, dinner, regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen's 
                country seat.</p>
              <p> 　　The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, 
                and his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian 
                frontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given 
                by his aides-de-camp at Bennigsen's country house.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters 
                declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled 
                in one place. Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian 
                ladies who had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna 
                and eclipsed the refined Polish ladies by her massive, so called 
                Russian type of beauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her 
                with a dance.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris Drubetskoy, having left his wife in Moscow and being 
                for the present en garcon (as he phrased it), was also there and, 
                though not an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward 
                the expenses. Boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors 
                and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with 
                the highest of those of his own age. He was meeting Helene in 
                Vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall 
                the past, but as Helene was enjoying the favors of a very important 
                personage and Boris had only recently married, they met as good 
                friends of long standing.</p>
              <p> 　　At midnight dancing was still going on. Helene, not having 
                a suitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with 
                Boris. They were the third couple. Boris, coolly looking at Helene's 
                dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, 
                gauze gown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same 
                time, unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for 
                an instant ceased to observe the Emperor who was in the same room. 
                The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping 
                now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone 
                knew how to utter.</p>
              <p> 　　As the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adjutant General Balashev, 
                one of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to 
                him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was 
                talking to a Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the 
                Emperor looked inquiringly at Balashev and, evidently understanding 
                that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for 
                so doing, nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly 
                had Balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared 
                on the Emperor's face. He took Balashev by the arm and crossed 
                the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide 
                as the people on both sides made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev's 
                excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashev. Arakcheev 
                looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his 
                red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor 
                to address him. (Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev 
                and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the 
                Emperor otherwise than through himself.)</p>
              <p> 　　But the Emperor and Balashev passed out into the illuminated 
                garden without noticing Arakcheev who, holding his sword and glancing 
                wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.</p>
              <p> 　　All the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka, 
                he was worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought 
                and how he could find it out before others. In the figure in which 
                he had to choose two ladies, he whispered to Helene that he meant 
                to choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto 
                the veranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into 
                the garden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor returning to 
                the veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. 
                Boris, fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully 
                pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.</p>
              <p> 　　The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally 
                affronted, was finishing with these words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make 
                peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country!&quot; 
                It seemed to Boris that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter 
                these words. He was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed 
                his thoughts, but displeased that Boris had overheard it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let no one know of it! &quot; the Emperor added with 
                a frown.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris understood that this was meant for him and, closing 
                his eyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the 
                ballroom and remained there about another half-hour.</p>
              <p> 　　Boris was thus the first to learn the news that the French 
                army had crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show 
                certain important personages that much that was concealed from 
                others was usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher 
                in their estimation. </p>
              <p> 　　The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen 
                was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, 
                and at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence 
                of indignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that 
                pleased him, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become 
                famous. On returning home at two o'clock that night he sent for 
                his secretary, Shishkov, and told him to write an order to the 
                troops and a rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykov, in which 
                he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make 
                peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on Russian 
                soil.</p>
              <p> 　　Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon: </p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur mon frere,</p>
              <p> 　　Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty which I have 
                kept my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed 
                the Russian frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg 
                a note, in which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this 
                aggression, that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in 
                a state of war with me from the time Prince Kuragin asked for 
                his passports. The reasons on which the Duc de Bassano based his 
                refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose 
                that that could serve as a pretext for aggression. In fact, the 
                ambassador, as he himself has declared, was never authorized to 
                make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of it I let him 
                know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at 
                his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of 
                our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw 
                your troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed 
                as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be 
                possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself 
                forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked. 
                It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the 
                calamity of another war. I am, etc.</p>

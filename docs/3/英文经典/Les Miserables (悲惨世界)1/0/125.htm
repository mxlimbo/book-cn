              <p> 　　 Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called 
                the white Paternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing 
                people straight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God 
                said, which God placed in paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three angels sitting 
                on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good Virgin Mary 
                in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation.</p>
              <p> 　　The good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the 
                three apostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters.</p>
              <p> 　　The shirt in which God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret's 
                cross is written on my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through 
                the meadows, weeping for God, when she met M. Saint John.</p>
              <p> 　　`Monsieur Saint John, whence come you?' `I come from Ave Salus.'</p>
              <p> 　　`You have not seen the good God; where is he?' `He is on the 
                tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands nailed, a little 
                cap of white thorns on his head.'</p>
              <p> 　　Whoever shall say this thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, 
                shall win paradise at the last.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the 
                wall under a triple coating of daubing paint.</p>
              <p> 　　At the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories 
                of several who were young girls then, and who are old women now.</p>
              <p> 　　A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration 
                of this refectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, 
                opened on the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formed 
                two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory.</p>
              <p> 　　The walls were white, the tables were black; these two mourning 
                colors constitute the only variety in convents.</p>
              <p> 　　The meals were plain, and the food of the children themselves 
                severe.</p>
              <p> 　　A single dish of meat and vegetables combined, or salt fish--such 
                was their luxury.</p>
              <p> 　　This meagre fare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, 
                was, nevertheless, an exception. The children ate in silence, 
                under the eye of the mother whose turn it was, who, if a fly took 
                a notion to fly or to hum against the rule, opened and shut a 
                wooden book from time to time. This silence was seasoned with 
                the lives of the saints, read aloud from a little pulpit with 
                a desk, which was situated at the foot of the crucifix.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn. At regular 
                distances, on the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls 
                in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and 
                forks, and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough 
                meat or spoiled fish; this was punished.</p>
              <p> 　　These bowls were called ronds d'eau. The child who broke the 
                silence &quot;made a cross with her tongue.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Where?</p>
              <p> 　　On the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　She licked the pavement. The dust, that end of all joys, was 
                charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose-leaves 
                which had been guilty of chirping.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in the convent a book which has never been printed 
                except as a unique copy, and which it is forbidden to read.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the rule of Saint-Benoit. An arcanum which no profane 
                eye must penetrate. Nemo regulas, seu constitutiones nostras, 
                externis communicabit.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this 
                book, and set to reading it with avidity, a reading which was 
                often interrupted by the fear of being caught, which caused them 
                to close the volume precipitately.</p>
              <p> 　　From the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very 
                moderate amount of pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　The most &quot;interesting thing&quot; they found were some 
                unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.</p>
              <p> 　　They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few 
                shabby fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the 
                severity of the punishments administered, when the wind had shaken 
                the trees, they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple 
                or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly.</p>
              <p> 　　I will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which 
                lies before me, a letter written five and twenty years ago by 
                an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de---- one of the most elegant 
                women in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　I quote literally: &quot;One hides one's pear or one's apple 
                as best one may. When one goes up stairs to put the veil on the 
                bed before supper, one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night 
                one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them 
                in the closet.&quot; That was one of their greatest luxuries.</p>
              <p> 　　Once--it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop 
                to the convent-- one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, 
                who was connected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that 
                she would ask for a day's leave of absence--an enormity in so 
                austere a community. The wager was accepted, but not one of those 
                who bet believed that she would do it.</p>
              <p> 　　When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front 
                of the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror 
                of her companions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, &quot;Monseigneur, 
                a day's leave of absence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with the prettiest 
                little rosy face in the world. M. de Quelen smiled and said, &quot;What, 
                my dear child, a day's leave of absence!</p>
              <p> 　　Three days if you like.</p>
              <p> 　　I grant you three days.&quot; The prioress could do nothing; 
                the archbishop had spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the 
                pupil.</p>
              <p> 　　The effect may be imagined.</p>
              <p> 　　This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but 
                that the life of the passions of the outside world, drama, and 
                even romance, did not make their way in.</p>
              <p> 　　To prove this, we will confine ourselves to recording here 
                and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact, which, 
                however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected 
                by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating.</p>
              <p> 　　We mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy 
                of the convent in the reader's mind.</p>
              <p> 　　About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person 
                who was not a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who 
                was addressed as Madame Albertine.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad, and that 
                in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it was 
                said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great 
                marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion 
                and tolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. 
                Could she see?</p>
              <p> 　　There was some doubt about this.</p>
              <p> 　　She glided rather than walked, she never spoke; it was not 
                quite known whether she breathed.</p>
              <p> 　　Her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their 
                last sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　To touch her hand was like touching snow. She possessed a 
                strange spectral grace.</p>
              <p> 　　Wherever she entered, people felt cold.</p>
              <p> 　　One day a sister, on seeing her pass, said to another sister, 
                &quot;She passes for a dead woman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps she is one,&quot; replied the other.</p>
              <p> 　　A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine.</p>
              <p> 　　This arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils.</p>
              <p> 　　In the chapel there was a gallery called L'OEil de Boeuf.</p>
              <p> 　　It was in this gallery, which had only a circular bay, an 
                oeil de boeuf, that Madame Albertine listened to the offices.</p>
              <p> 　　She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on 
                the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating 
                priest could be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day 
                the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le 
                Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 
                1815 when he was Prince de Leon, and who died afterward, in 1830, 
                as cardinal and Archbishop of Besancon.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the 
                Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect 
                calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services.</p>
              <p> 　　That day, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she 
                half rose, and said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the 
                chapel, &quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　Auguste!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher 
                raised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. 
                A breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for 
                an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, 
                and the mad woman had become a corpse again.</p>
              <p> 　　Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent 
                who had the privilege of speech to chattering.</p>
              <p> 　　How many things were contained in that &quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　Auguste!&quot; what revelations!</p>
              <p> 　　M. de Rohan's name really was Auguste.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very 
                highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own 
                rank there was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly 
                of so great a lord, and that there existed between them some connection, 
                of relationship, perhaps, but a very close one in any case, since 
                she knew his &quot;pet name.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Serent, 
                often visited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, 
                in virtue of the privilege Magnates mulieres, and caused great 
                consternation in the boarding-school. When these two old ladies 
                passed by, all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object 
                of attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been 
                made, while waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop 
                of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate 
                the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not 
                one of the young recluses could see him, because of the serge 
                curtain, but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they 
                had come to know and to distinguish.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very 
                coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed 
                in a roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent 
                moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut 
                in the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen 
                years.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a sound from without made its way into the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　But there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated 
                thither. This was an event, and the girls who were at school there 
                at the time still recall it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood.</p>
              <p> 　　This flute always played the same air, an air which is very 
                far away nowadays,--&quot;My Zetulbe, come reign o'er my soul,&quot;--and 
                it was heard two or three times a day.</p>
              <p> 　　The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal 
                mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended 
                in showers.</p>
              <p> 　　This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or 
                less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that 
                she was Zetulbe.</p>
              <p> 　　The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the 
                Rue Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised 
                everything, attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching 
                a glance, if only for a second, of the &quot;young man&quot; who 
                played that flute so deliciously, and who, no doubt, played on 
                all these souls at the same time.</p>
              <p> 　　There were some who made their escape by a back door, and 
                ascended to the third story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order 
                to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps.</p>
              <p> 　　Impossible!</p>
              <p> 　　One even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, 
                and to wave her white handkerchief. Two were still bolder.</p>
              <p> 　　They found means to climb on a roof, and risked their lives 
                there, and succeeded at last in seeing &quot;the young man.&quot; 
                He was an old emigre gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing 
                his flute in his attic, in order to pass the time.</p>

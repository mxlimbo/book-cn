              <p> 　　THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR DEPARTURE</p>
              <p> 　　It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, 
                which we left on the road, entered the porte-cochere of the Hotel 
                de la Poste in Arras; the man whom we have been following up to 
                this moment alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air 
                to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra 
                horse, and with his own hands led the little white horse to the 
                stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-room which was situated 
                on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned his elbows on 
                a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he 
                had counted on making in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledge 
                that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was not sorry.</p>
              <p> 　　The landlady of the hotel entered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does Monsieur wish a bed?</p>
              <p> 　　Does Monsieur require supper?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He made a sign of the head in the negative.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The stableman says that Monsieur's horse is extremely 
                fatigued.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here he broke his silence.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again 
                to-morrow morning?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He inquired:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is not the posting-station located here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, 
                and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same 
                night to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy 
                chanced to be vacant; he engaged it and paid for it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the clerk, &quot;do not fail to 
                be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the 
                town.</p>
              <p> 　　He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and 
                he walked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the 
                way of the passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and 
                found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his 
                way. A citizen was passing along with a lantern.</p>
              <p> 　　After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this man, not 
                without having first glanced behind and in front of him, as though 
                he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was 
                about to put.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;where is the court-house, 
                if you please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You do not belong in town, sir?&quot; replied the bourgeois, 
                who was an oldish man; &quot;well, follow me.</p>
              <p> 　　I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house, 
                that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture; 
                for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment, 
                and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the 
                prefecture.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it there that the Assizes are held?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was 
                the bishop's palace before the Revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　M. de Conzie, who was bishop in '82, built a grand hall there.</p>
              <p> 　　It is in this grand hall that the court is held.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the way, the bourgeois said to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather 
                late. The sittings generally close at six o'clock.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed 
                out to him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a 
                vast and gloomy building.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived 
                in season. Do you see those four windows?</p>
              <p> 　　That is the Court of Assizes. There is light there, so they 
                are not through.</p>
              <p> 　　The matter must have been greatly protracted, and they are 
                holding an evening session. Do you take an interest in this affair?</p>
              <p> 　　Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak 
                to one of the lawyers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is different,&quot; said the bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop, sir; here is the door where the sentry stands.</p>
              <p> 　　You have only to ascend the grand staircase.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He conformed to the bourgeois's directions, and a few minutes 
                later he was in a hall containing many people, and where groups, 
                intermingled with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together 
                here and there.</p>
              <p> 　　It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations 
                of men robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the 
                threshold of the halls of justice.</p>
              <p> 　　It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these 
                words.</p>
              <p> 　　Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be 
                the result.</p>
              <p> 　　All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer 
                so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert 
                all sorts of dark edifices.</p>
              <p> 　　This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the 
                old hall of the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall 
                of the palace of justice.</p>
              <p> 　　A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, separated 
                it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.</p>
              <p> 　　The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the 
                first lawyer whom he met.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What stage have they reached, sir?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is finished,&quot; said the lawyer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Finished!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned 
                round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No; I know no one here.</p>
              <p> 　　Has judgment been pronounced?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing else was possible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To penal servitude?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then his identity was established?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What identity?&quot; replied the lawyer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There was no identity to be established.</p>
              <p> 　　The matter was very simple.</p>
              <p> 　　The woman had murdered her child; the infanticide was proved; 
                the jury threw out the question of premeditation, and she was 
                condemned for life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it was a woman?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, certainly.</p>
              <p> 　　The Limosin woman.</p>
              <p> 　　Of what are you speaking?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still 
                lighted?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What other case?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! this one is a clear case also.</p>
              <p> 　　It is about a sort of blackguard; a man arrested for a second 
                offence; a convict who has been guilty of theft.</p>
              <p> 　　I don't know his name exactly.</p>
              <p> 　　There's a bandit's phiz for you!</p>
              <p> 　　I'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I really think that there is not.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a great crowd. However, the hearing has been suspended.</p>
              <p> 　　Some people have gone out, and when the hearing is resumed, 
                you might make an effort.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is the entrance?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Through yonder large door.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The lawyer left him.</p>
              <p> 　　In the course of a few moments he had experienced, almost 
                simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible 
                emotions.</p>
              <p> 　　The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, pierced 
                his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he 
                saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but 
                he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were 
                saying. The docket of the session was very heavy; the president 
                had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases.</p>
              <p> 　　They had begun with the infanticide, and now they had reached 
                the convict, the old offender, the &quot;return horse.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to be 
                entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already 
                been in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect 
                to his case.</p>
              <p> 　　However, the man's examination and the depositions of the 
                witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer's plea, and the speech 
                of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished 
                before midnight.</p>
              <p> 　　The man would probably be condemned; the attorney-general 
                was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he was a brilliant 
                fellow who wrote verses.</p>
              <p> 　　An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of 
                the Assizes. He inquired of this usher:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will the door be opened soon, sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It will not be opened at all,&quot; replied the usher.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not 
                the hearing suspended?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The hearing has just been begun again,&quot; replied 
                the usher, &quot;but the door will not be opened again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because the hall is full.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　There is not room for one more?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not another one.</p>
              <p> 　　The door is closed.</p>
              <p> 　　No one can enter now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The usher added after a pause:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are, to tell the truth, two or three extra places 
                behind Monsieur le President, but Monsieur le President only admits 
                public functionaries to them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　So saying, the usher turned his back.</p>
              <p> 　　He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and 
                slowly descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. 
                It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent 
                conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding 
                evening was not yet ended; and every moment he encountered some 
                new phase of it.</p>
              <p> 　　On reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against 
                the balusters and folded his arms.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, 
                took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he 
                wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line:</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M.; then he ascended the stairs 
                once more with great strides, made his way through the crowd, 
                walked straight up to the usher, handed him the paper, and said 
                in an authoritative manner:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take this to Monsieur le President.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.</p>

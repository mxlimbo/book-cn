              <p>　　Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, 
                the personwho is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, 
                and directinghis course towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was 
                pursuinga broad paved road, which undulated between two rows of 
                trees,over the hills which succeed each other, raise the road 
                and let itfall again, and produce something in the nature of enormous 
                waves.</p>
              <p>　　He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west 
                heperceived the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which hasthe 
                form of a reversed vase. He had just left behind a wood uponan 
                eminence; and at the angle of the cross-road, by the sideof a 
                sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription AncientBarrier No. 
                4, a public house, bearing on its front this sign: At the Four 
                Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau, Private Cafe.</p>
              <p>　　A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom 
                of alittle valley, where there is water which passes beneath an 
                archmade through the embankment of the road. The clump of sparselyplanted 
                but very green trees, which fills the valley on one side ofthe 
                road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappearsgracefully 
                and as in order in the direction of Braine-l'Alleud.</p>
              <p>　　On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled 
                cartat the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap 
                of driedbrushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a 
                square hole,and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with 
                straw partitions. A young girl was weeding in a field, where a 
                huge yellow poster,probably of some outside spectacle, such as 
                a parish festival,was fluttering in the wind. At one corner of 
                the inn, beside a poolin which a flotilla of ducks was navigating, 
                a badly paved path plungedinto the bushes. The wayfarer struck 
                into this.</p>
              <p>　　After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of thefifteenth 
                century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks setin contrast, 
                he found himself before a large door of arched stone,with a rectilinear 
                impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flankedby two flat 
                medallions. A severe facade rose above this door;a wall, perpendicular 
                to the facade, almost touched the door,and flanked it with an 
                abrupt right angle. In the meadowbefore the door lay three harrows, 
                through which, in disorder,grew all the flowers of May. The door 
                was closed. The two decrepitleaves which barred it were ornamented 
                with an old rusty knocker.</p>
              <p>　　The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering 
                of May,which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from 
                the wind. A brave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling 
                in a distractedmanner in a large tree.</p>
              <p>　　The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular 
                excavation,resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on 
                the left,at the foot of the pier of the door.</p>
              <p>　　At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasantwoman 
                emerged.</p>
              <p>　　She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It was a French cannon-ball which made that,&quot; she 
                said to him. And she added:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;That which you see there, higher up in the door, near 
                a nail,is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The 
                bullet didnot pierce the wood.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is the name of this place?&quot; inquired the wayfarer.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Hougomont,&quot; said the peasant woman.</p>
              <p>　　The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces,and 
                went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizonthrough 
                the trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation,and on this 
                elevation something which at that distance resembleda lion.</p>
              <p>　　He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.</p>

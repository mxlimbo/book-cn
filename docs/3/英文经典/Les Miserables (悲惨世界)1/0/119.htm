              <p> 　　THE MAN WITH THE BELL</p>
              <p> 　　 He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. 
                He had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket 
                of his waistcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　The man's head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. 
                In a few strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One hundred francs!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man gave a start and raised his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You can earn a hundred francs,&quot; went on Jean Valjean, 
                &quot;if you will grant me shelter for this night.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean's terrified countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!&quot; said the 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that 
                unknown spot, by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.</p>
              <p> 　　He had expected anything but that.</p>
              <p> 　　The person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old 
                man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his left knee 
                a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.</p>
              <p> 　　His face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.</p>
              <p> 　　However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling 
                all over:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, good God!</p>
              <p> 　　How come you here, Father Madeleine?</p>
              <p> 　　Where did you enter?</p>
              <p> 　　Dieu-Jesus! Did you fall from heaven?</p>
              <p> 　　There is no trouble about that:</p>
              <p> 　　if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state 
                you are in!</p>
              <p> 　　You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat!</p>
              <p> 　　Do you know, you would have frightened any one who did not 
                know you?</p>
              <p> 　　No coat!</p>
              <p> 　　Lord God!</p>
              <p> 　　Are the saints going mad nowadays?</p>
              <p> 　　But how did you get in here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His words tumbled over each other.</p>
              <p> 　　The goodman talked with a rustic volubility, in which there 
                was nothing alarming.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive 
                kindliness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you? and what house is this?&quot; demanded 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! pardieu, this is too much!&quot; exclaimed the old 
                man. &quot;I am the person for whom you got the place here, and 
                this house is the one where you had me placed.</p>
              <p> 　　What!</p>
              <p> 　　You don't recognize me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; said Jean Valjean; &quot;and how happens it 
                that you know me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You saved my life,&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned.</p>
              <p> 　　A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean 
                recognized old Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;so it is you?</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, I recollect you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is very lucky,&quot; said the old man, in a reproachful 
                tone.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what are you doing here?&quot; resumed Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, I am covering my melons, of course!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old 
                Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he 
                was occupied in spreading over the melon bed.</p>
              <p> 　　During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden 
                he had already spread out a number of them. It was this operation 
                which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed 
                from the shed by Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I said to myself, `The moon is bright:</p>
              <p> 　　it is going to freeze. What if I were to put my melons into 
                their greatcoats?'</p>
              <p> 　　And,&quot; he added, looking at Jean Valjean with a broad 
                smile,--&quot;pardieu! you ought to have done the same!</p>
              <p> 　　But how do you come here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least 
                only under the name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with 
                caution. He multiplied his questions.</p>
              <p> 　　Strange to say, their roles seemed to be reversed.</p>
              <p> 　　It was he, the intruder, who interrogated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This,&quot; replied Fauchelevent, &quot;is so that I 
                may be avoided.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                &quot;What! so that you may be avoided?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many 
                young girls. It appears that I should be a dangerous person to 
                meet.</p>
              <p> 　　The bell gives them warning.</p>
              <p> 　　When I come, they go.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What house is this?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, you know well enough.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I do not.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not when you got me the place here as gardener?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Answer me as though I knew nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Memories recurred to Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Chance, that is to say, Providence, had cast him into precisely 
                that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old Fauchelevent, 
                crippled by the fall from his cart, had been admitted on his recommendation 
                two years previously. He repeated, as though talking to himself:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Petit-Picpus convent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Exactly,&quot; returned old Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But to come to the point, how the deuce did you manage 
                to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter if you are a 
                saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You certainly are here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is no one but me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Still,&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;I must stay here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, good God!&quot; cried Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in 
                a grave voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was the first to recall it,&quot; returned Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for 
                you in the olden days.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands 
                Jean Valjean's two robust hands, and stood for several minutes 
                as though incapable of speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　At length he exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I 
                could make you some little return for that!</p>
              <p> 　　Save your life!</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur le Maire, dispose of the old man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man.</p>
              <p> 　　His countenance seemed to emit a ray of light.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you wish me to do?&quot; he resumed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That I will explain to you.</p>
              <p> 　　You have a chamber?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of 
                the old convent, in a corner which no one ever looks into.</p>
              <p> 　　There are three rooms in it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and 
                so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean 
                had not perceived it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good,&quot; said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now I am going to ask two things of you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are they, Mr. Mayor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the first place, you are not to tell any one what 
                you know about me. In the second, you are not to try to find out 
                anything more.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As you please.</p>
              <p> 　　I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, that you 
                have always been a man after the good God's heart. And then, moreover, 
                you it was who placed me here.</p>
              <p> 　　That concerns you. I am at your service.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is settled then.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, come with me.</p>
              <p> 　　We will go and get the child.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said Fauchelevent, &quot;so there is a child?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as 
                a dog follows his master.</p>
              <p> 　　Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy 
                again before the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the 
                old gardener's bed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his 
                hat, which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked 
                up.</p>
              <p> 　　While Jean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had 
                removed the bell and kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside 
                a vintage basket that adorned the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　The two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting 
                on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, 
                black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man 
                was saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter's 
                knee:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you 
                save people's lives, and then you forget them!</p>
              <p> 　　That is bad!</p>
              <p> 　　But they remember you! You are an ingrate!&quot;</p>

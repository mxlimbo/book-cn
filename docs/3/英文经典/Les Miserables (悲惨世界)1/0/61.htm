              <p> 　　HINDRANCES</p>
              <p> 　　 The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated 
                at this period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. 
                These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside 
                with fawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two 
                seats, one for the postboy, the other for the traveller.</p>
              <p> 　　The wheels were armed with those long, offensive axles which 
                keep other vehicles at a distance, and which may still be seen 
                on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, 
                was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it.</p>
              <p> 　　This coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.</p>
              <p> 　　These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something 
                distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing 
                in the distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they 
                resembled the insects which are called, I think, termites, and 
                which, though with but little corselet, drag a great train behind 
                them. But they travelled at a very rapid rate.</p>
              <p> 　　The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o'clock every 
                night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur 
                M. a little before five o'clock in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by 
                the Hesdin road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it 
                was entering the town, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white 
                horse, which was going in the opposite direction, and in which 
                there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle.</p>
              <p> 　　The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock.</p>
              <p> 　　The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller 
                paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That man is in a devilish hurry!&quot; said the postman.</p>
              <p> 　　The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen 
                struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.</p>
              <p> 　　Whither was he going?</p>
              <p> 　　He could not have told.</p>
              <p> 　　Why was he hastening? He did not know.</p>
              <p> 　　He was driving at random, straight ahead.</p>
              <p> 　　Whither? To Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going 
                elsewhere as well. At times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　He plunged into the night as into a gulf.</p>
              <p> 　　Something urged him forward; something drew him on.</p>
              <p> 　　No one could have told what was taking place within him; every 
                one will understand it.</p>
              <p> 　　What man is there who has not entered, at least once in his 
                life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?</p>
              <p> 　　However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed 
                no plan, done nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. He 
                was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.</p>
              <p> 　　Why was he going to Arras?</p>
              <p> 　　He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had 
                hired Scaufflaire's cabriolet:</p>
              <p> 　　that, whatever the result was to be, there was no reason why 
                he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters for 
                himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took 
                place; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed 
                and scrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from 
                a distance; that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, 
                some wretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved 
                to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would 
                indeed be there; and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, 
                old convicts who had known him; but they certainly would not recognize 
                him;--bah! what an idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from 
                suspecting the truth; that all conjectures and all suppositions 
                were fixed on Champmathieu, and that there is nothing so headstrong 
                as suppositions and conjectures; that accordingly there was no 
                danger.</p>
              <p> 　　That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge 
                from it; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it 
                might be, in his own hand; that he was master of it.</p>
              <p> 　　He clung to this thought.</p>
              <p> 　　At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred 
                not to go to Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he was going thither.</p>
              <p> 　　As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding 
                at that fine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues 
                and a half an hour.</p>
              <p> 　　In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something 
                within him draw back.</p>
              <p> 　　At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur 
                M. lay far behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the chilly 
                figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes, but 
                without seeing them.</p>
              <p> 　　The morning has its spectres as well as the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and 
                by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these 
                black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and 
                sinister quality to the violent state of his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which 
                sometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, &quot;And 
                yet there are people there within who are sleeping!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels 
                on the road, produced a gentle, monotonous noise.</p>
              <p> 　　These things are charming when one is joyous, and lugubrious 
                when one is sad.</p>
              <p> 　　It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin.</p>
              <p> 　　He halted in front of the inn, to allow the horse a breathing 
                spell, and to have him given some oats.</p>
              <p> 　　The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small 
                race of the Boulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, 
                and not enough neck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, 
                a large crupper, thin, fine legs, and solid hoofs--a homely, but 
                a robust and healthy race.</p>
              <p> 　　The excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, 
                and had not a drop of sweat on his loins.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not get out of the tilbury.</p>
              <p> 　　The stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and 
                examined the left wheel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you going far in this condition?&quot; said the 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from 
                his revery:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you come from a great distance?&quot; went on the 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Five leagues.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why do you say, `Ah?'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with 
                his eyes fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, 
                it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sprang out of the tilbury.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is that you say, my friend?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled 
                five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch 
                on the highway. Just see here!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The wheel really had suffered serious damage.</p>
              <p> 　　The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes 
                and strained the hub, so that the nut no longer held firm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My friend,&quot; he said to the stableman, &quot;is 
                there a wheelwright here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do me the service to go and fetch him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is only a step from here.</p>
              <p> 　　Hey!</p>
              <p> 　　Master Bourgaillard!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his 
                own threshold. He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace 
                like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can you repair this wheel immediately?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When can I set out again?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To-morrow!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is a long day's work on it.</p>
              <p> 　　Are you in a hurry, sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In a very great hurry.</p>
              <p> 　　I must set out again in an hour at the latest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will pay whatever you ask.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, in two hours, then.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be 
                made. Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you 
                were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How so?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a wheelwright?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you not a wheel that you can sell me?</p>
              <p> 　　Then I could start again at once.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A spare wheel?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet.</p>
              <p> 　　Two wheels make a pair.</p>
              <p> 　　Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Try, nevertheless.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is useless, sir.</p>
              <p> 　　I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but a poor 
                country here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury 
                was a hired vehicle.</p>
              <p> 　　He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well!</p>
              <p> 　　If I had one, I would not let it to you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, sell it to me, then.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have none.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, 
                as you see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We live in a poor country.</p>
              <p> 　　There is, in truth,&quot; added the wheelwright, &quot;an 
                old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois 
                of the town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses 
                it on the thirty-sixth of the month--never, that is to say.</p>
              <p> 　　I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?</p>
              <p> 　　But the bourgeois must not see it pass--and then, it is a 
                calash; it would require two horses.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will take two post-horses.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is Monsieur going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Arras.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By taking two post-horses?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives 
                at four o'clock to-morrow morning?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by 
                taking post-horses-- Monsieur has his passport?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras 
                before to-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly 
                served, the horses are in the fields.</p>
              <p> 　　The season for ploughing is just beginning; heavy teams are 
                required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from the post 
                as well as elsewhere.</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least 
                at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk.</p>
              <p> 　　There are many hills to ascend.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come then, I will go on horseback.</p>
              <p> 　　Unharness the cabriolet. Some one can surely sell me a saddle 
                in the neighborhood.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Without doubt.</p>
              <p> 　　But will this horse bear the saddle?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear 
                it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But I can surely hire a horse in the village?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That would require such a horse as does not exist in 
                these parts. You would have to buy it to begin with, because no 
                one knows you. But you will not find one for sale nor to let, 
                for five hundred francs, or for a thousand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What am I to do?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an 
                honest man, and set out on your journey to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To-morrow will be too late.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The deuce!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras?</p>
              <p> 　　When will it pass?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going 
                as well as the one coming.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　It will take you a day to mend this wheel?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A day, and a good long one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you set two men to work?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I set ten men to work.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; 
                and the felly is in a bad state, too.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there another wheelwright?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with 
                a toss of the head</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He felt an immense joy.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that Providence was intervening.</p>
              <p> 　　That it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and 
                who was stopping him on the road.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just 
                made every possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally 
                and scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither 
                by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing 
                with which to reproach himself.</p>
              <p> 　　If he went no further, that was no fault of his.</p>
              <p> 　　It did not concern him further. It was no longer his fault.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not the act of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　He breathed again.</p>
              <p> 　　He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for 
                the first time since Javert's visit.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his 
                heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting 
                Himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He said himself that he had done all he could, and that now 
                he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in 
                a chamber of the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would 
                have heard him, things would have rested there, and it is probable 
                that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which 
                the reader is about to peruse; but this conversation had taken 
                place in the street. Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts 
                a crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　There are always people who ask nothing better than to become 
                spectators. While he was questioning the wheelwright, some people 
                who were passing back and forth halted around them.</p>
              <p> 　　After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to whom no 
                one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran 
                off.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation 
                which we have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this 
                child returned.</p>
              <p> 　　He was accompanied by an old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the woman, &quot;my boy tells me 
                that you wish to hire a cabriolet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child 
                made the perspiration trickle down his limbs.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp 
                reappear in the darkness behind him, ready to seize him once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He answered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which 
                I can hire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he hastened to add:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But there is none in the place.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly there is,&quot; said the old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where?&quot; interpolated the wheelwright.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At my house,&quot; replied the old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　He shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　The fatal hand had grasped him again.</p>
              <p> 　　The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. 
                The wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect 
                of the traveller escaping their clutches, interfered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; 
                it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by 
                leather thongs; the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted 
                and eaten with moisture; it would not go much further than the 
                tilbury; a regular ramshackle old stage-wagon; the gentleman would 
                make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it,&quot; etc., 
                etc.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, 
                this thing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go 
                to Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright 
                to be repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the 
                white horse put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the 
                road which he had been travelling since morning.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he 
                had felt, a moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that 
                he should not go whither he was now proceeding.</p>
              <p> 　　He examined this joy with a sort of wrath, and found it absurd.</p>
              <p> 　　Why should he feel joy at turning back? After all, he was 
                taking this trip of his own free will. No one was forcing him 
                to it.</p>
              <p> 　　And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.</p>
              <p> 　　As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stop!</p>
              <p> 　　Stop!&quot; He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which 
                contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the old woman's little boy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the latter, &quot;it was I who 
                got the cart for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have not given me anything.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant 
                and almost odious.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! it's you, you scamp?&quot; said he; &quot;you shall 
                have nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.</p>
              <p> 　　He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin.</p>
              <p> 　　He wanted to make it good. The little horse was courageous, 
                and pulled for two; but it was the month of February, there had 
                been rain; the roads were bad. And then, it was no longer the 
                tilbury.</p>
              <p> 　　The cart was very heavy, and in addition, there were many 
                ascents.</p>
              <p> 　　He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; 
                four hours for five leagues.</p>
              <p> 　　At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn 
                he came to and led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, 
                he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating; he thought 
                of sad and confusing things.</p>
              <p> 　　The inn-keeper's wife came to the stable.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she 
                led him to the public room where there were tables covered with 
                waxed cloth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Make haste!&quot; said he; &quot;I must start again; 
                I am in a hurry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all 
                haste; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is what ailed me,&quot; he thought; &quot;I had 
                not breakfasted.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, 
                and then slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why is their bread so bitter here?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The carter was a German and did not understand him.</p>
              <p> 　　He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.</p>
              <p> 　　An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his 
                course towards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　What did he do during this journey?</p>
              <p> 　　Of what was he thinking? As in the morning, he watched the 
                trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields pass by, and the 
                way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road, 
                vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices 
                to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought.</p>
              <p> 　　What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand 
                objects for the first and the last time? To travel is to be born 
                and to die at every instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of 
                his mind, be did make comparisons between the shifting horizon 
                and our human existence:</p>
              <p> 　　all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; 
                the dark and bright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling 
                moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands 
                to grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the road, and, 
                all at once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish 
                an obscure door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing 
                us halts, and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing 
                amid the shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out 
                of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that 
                the days were still short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged 
                from the village, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, 
                raised his head and said to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That horse is very much fatigued.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you going to Arras?&quot; added the road-mender.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How far is it from here to Arras?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nearly seven good leagues.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues 
                and a quarter.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; returned the road-mender, &quot;so you don't 
                know that the road is under repair?</p>
              <p> 　　You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on; there 
                is no way to proceed further.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; 
                you will cross the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn 
                to the right; that is the road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads 
                to Arras.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it is night, and I shall lose my way.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You do not belong in these parts?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir,&quot; 
                resumed the road-mender; &quot;shall I give you a piece of advice? 
                your horse is tired; return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; 
                sleep there; you can reach Arras to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I must be there this evening.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and 
                get an extra horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the 
                cross-roads.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, 
                and, half an hour later, he passed the same spot again, but this 
                time at full speed, with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who 
                called himself a postilion, was seated on the shaft of the cariole.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, he felt that he had lost time.</p>
              <p> 　　Night had fully come.</p>
              <p> 　　They turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully 
                bad; the cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the 
                postilion:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir,&quot; said the 
                postilion; &quot;I don't know how to harness my horse now; this 
                road is very bad at night; if you wish to return and sleep at 
                Tinques, we could be in Arras early to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He replied, &quot;Have you a bit of rope and a knife?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.</p>
              <p> 　　This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out 
                again at a gallop.</p>
              <p> 　　The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept 
                over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke:</p>
              <p> 　　there were whitish gleams in the clouds; a strong breeze which 
                blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon, 
                as of some one moving furniture; everything that could be seen 
                assumed attitudes of terror. How many things shiver beneath these 
                vast breaths of the night!</p>
              <p> 　　He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night 
                before; he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast 
                plain in the neighborhood of D----, eight years previously, and 
                it seemed but yesterday.</p>
              <p> 　　The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What time is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Seven o'clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we 
                have but three leagues still to go.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection, 
                thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: 
                that all this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; 
                that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial; that he 
                should, at least, have informed himself of that; that he was foolish 
                to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be 
                of any service or not; then he sketched out some calculations 
                in his mind: that, ordinarily, the sittings of the Court of Assizes 
                began at nine o'clock in the morning; that it could not be a long 
                affair; that the theft of the apples would be very brief; that 
                there would then remain only a question of identity, four or five 
                depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that he should 
                arrive after all was over.</p>
              <p> 　　The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the 
                river and left Mont-Saint-Eloy behind them.</p>
              <p> 　　The night grew more profound.</p>

              <p> 　　JAVERT SATISFIED</p>
              <p> 　　 This is what had taken place.</p>
              <p> 　　The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine 
                quitted the Hall of Assizes in Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　He regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail-wagon, 
                in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o'clock 
                in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his first care 
                had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the infirmary 
                and see Fantine.</p>
              <p> 　　However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court 
                of Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first 
                shock, had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable 
                mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been 
                in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be 
                explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation 
                of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. 
                The district-attorney's persistence was visibly at variance with 
                the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and 
                of the jury.</p>
              <p> 　　The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting 
                this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of the 
                revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean 
                Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, 
                and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. 
                Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, 
                unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, 
                in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and 
                in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean 
                Valjean; and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the 
                district-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred 
                &quot;as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire 
                of M. sur M.&quot; This phrase, in which there was a great deal 
                of of, is the district-attorney's, written with his own hand, 
                on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first 
                emotion having passed off, the President did not offer many objections. 
                Justice must, after all, take its course.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, when all was said, although the President was a 
                kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, 
                a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked 
                to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, 
                when alluding to the landing at Cannes.</p>
              <p> 　　The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorney 
                forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, 
                and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately 
                after having given his deposition.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed 
                him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, 
                who, in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at 
                Arras. The order of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was 
                couched in these words:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur 
                Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this day's session of the 
                court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see 
                him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, 
                could have divined nothing of what had taken place, and would 
                have thought his air the most ordinary in the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth 
                upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his 
                habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly acquainted with 
                him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment, would 
                have shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　The buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead 
                of at the nape of his neck.</p>
              <p> 　　This betrayed unwonted agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in 
                his duty or in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid 
                with the buttons of his coat.</p>
              <p> 　　That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was 
                indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of 
                those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.</p>
              <p> 　　He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the 
                neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the 
                soldiers in the courtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed out 
                to him by the portress, who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed 
                as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, 
                pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a 
                police spy, and entered.</p>
              <p> 　　Properly speaking, he did not enter.</p>
              <p> 　　He stood erect in the half-open door, his hat on his head 
                and his left hand thrust into his coat, which was buttoned up 
                to the chin.</p>
              <p> 　　In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane, 
                which was hidden behind him, could be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence 
                being perceived.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M. 
                Madeleine turn round.</p>
              <p> 　　The instant that Madeleine's glance encountered Javert's glance, 
                Javert, without stirring, without moving from his post, without 
                approaching him, became terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned 
                soul.</p>
              <p> 　　The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused 
                all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　The depths having been stirred up, mounted to the surface.</p>
              <p> 　　The humiliation of having, in some slight degree, lost the 
                scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments, in an error 
                with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride at having so 
                well and accurately divined in the first place, and of having 
                for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert's content shone 
                forth in his sovereign attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow.</p>
              <p> 　　All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can 
                afford were there.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was in heaven at that moment.</p>
              <p> 　　Without putting the thing clearly to himself, but with a confused 
                intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success, 
                he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth in their celestial 
                function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him, at an 
                infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, 
                the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he 
                was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders, 
                he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the 
                absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory.</p>
              <p> 　　There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of 
                combat.</p>
              <p> 　　Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day 
                the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. The terrible 
                shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague 
                flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; 
                happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, 
                perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and 
                there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.</p>
              <p> 　　Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, 
                are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed; but 
                which, even when hideous, remain grand:</p>
              <p> 　　their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human conscience, 
                clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues which 
                have one vice,--error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in 
                the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously 
                venerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert 
                in his formidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant 
                man who triumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible 
                as this face, wherein was displayed all that may be designated 
                as the evil of the good.</p>

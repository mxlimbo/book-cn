              <p> 　　LUC-ESPRIT</p>
              <p> 　　 At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had 
                the honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties 
                at the same time--ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung 
                by Voltaire, the Camargo and the Salle.</p>
              <p> 　　Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic retreat towards 
                a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was sixteen like 
                himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love.</p>
              <p> 　　He abounded in memories.</p>
              <p> 　　He was accustomed to exclaim: &quot;How pretty she was--that 
                Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps, 
                her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her come-and-see 
                of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly arrived, 
                and her little agitation muff!&quot; He had worn in his young 
                manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking 
                about effusively.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,&quot; 
                said he.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was 
                twenty, had described him as &quot;a charming fool.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics 
                and in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. He read 
                the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said, stifling 
                outbursts of laughter the while.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh!&quot; he said, &quot;what people these are!</p>
              <p> 　　Corbiere!</p>
              <p> 　　Humann!</p>
              <p> 　　Casimir Perier! There's a minister for you!</p>
              <p> 　　I can imagine this in a journal: `M. Gillenorman, minister!' 
                that would be a farce.</p>
              <p> 　　Well!</p>
              <p> 　　They are so stupid that it would pass&quot;; he merrily called 
                everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and did not 
                restrain himself in the least before ladies.</p>
              <p> 　　He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth with a 
                certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. 
                It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century. It 
                is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age 
                of crudities in prose.</p>
              <p> 　　His god-father had predicted that he would turn out a man 
                of genius, and had bestowed on him these two significant names:</p>
              <p> 　　Luc-Esprit.</p>

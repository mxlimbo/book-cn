              <p> 　　M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING</p>
              <p> 　　 At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death 
                of M. Myriel, Bishop of D----, surnamed &quot;Monseigneur Bienvenu,&quot; 
                who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.</p>
              <p> 　　The Bishop of D---- --to supply here a detail which the papers 
                omitted-- had been blind for many years before his death, and 
                content to be blind, as his sister was beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, 
                is, in fact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness 
                upon this earth, where nothing is complete.</p>
              <p> 　　To have continually at one's side a woman, a daughter, a sister, 
                a charming being, who is there because you need her and because 
                she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensable to 
                a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measure 
                one's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows 
                on us, and to say to ourselves, &quot;Since she consecrates the 
                whole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of 
                her heart&quot;; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to 
                be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of 
                the world; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings; 
                to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return, sing, and to think 
                that one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; to manifest 
                at each instant one's personal attraction; to feel one's self 
                all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; to become in 
                one's obscurity, and through one's obscurity, the star around 
                which this angel gravitates,--few felicities equal this. The supreme 
                happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved; 
                loved for one's own sake--let us say rather, loved in spite of 
                one's self; this conviction the blind man possesses. To be served 
                in distress is to be caressed.</p>
              <p> 　　Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when 
                one has love.</p>
              <p> 　　And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue!</p>
              <p> 　　There is no blindness where there is certainty.</p>
              <p> 　　Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. And this soul, found 
                and tested, is a woman.</p>
              <p> 　　A hand sustains you; it is hers:</p>
              <p> 　　a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear 
                a breath very near you; it is hers.</p>
              <p> 　　To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, never 
                to be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon 
                that immovable reed, to touch Providence with one's hands, and 
                to be able to take it in one's arms,--God made tangible,--what 
                bliss!</p>
              <p> 　　The heart, that obscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious 
                blossoming. One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness! 
                The angel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, 
                it is but to return again; she vanishes like a dream, and reappears 
                like reality.</p>
              <p> 　　One feels warmth approaching, and behold! she is there. One 
                overflows with serenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance 
                amid the night.</p>
              <p> 　　And there are a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are 
                enormous in that void.</p>
              <p> 　　The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed 
                to lull you, and supplying the vanished universe to you.</p>
              <p> 　　One is caressed with the soul. One sees nothing, but one feels 
                that one is adored.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a paradise of shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed 
                to the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal 
                of M. sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad 
                wholly in black, and with crape on his hat.</p>
              <p> 　　This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to throw a light on M. Madeleine's origin.</p>
              <p> 　　It was concluded that some relationship existed between him 
                and the venerable Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has gone into mourning for the Bishop of D----&quot; 
                said the drawing-rooms; this raised M. Madeleine's credit greatly, 
                and procured for him, instantly and at one blow, a certain consideration 
                in the noble world of M. sur M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain 
                of the place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, 
                the probable relative of a bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, 
                by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more 
                plentiful smiles of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that 
                petty great world, who was curious by right of seniority, ventured 
                to ask him, &quot;M. le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late 
                Bishop of D----?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He said, &quot;No, Madame.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But,&quot; resumed the dowager, &quot;you are wearing 
                mourning for him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He replied, &quot;It is because I was a servant in his family 
                in my youth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that 
                he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about 
                the country and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, 
                inquired his name, and gave him money.</p>
              <p> 　　The little Savoyards told each other about it:</p>
              <p> 　　a great many of them passed that way.</p>

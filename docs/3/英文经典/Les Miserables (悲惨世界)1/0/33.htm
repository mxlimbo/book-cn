              <p>　　AT BOMBARDA'S</p>
              <p>　　The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to 
                think about dinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary 
                at last, became stranded in Bombarda's public house, a branch 
                establishment which had been set up in the Champs-Elysees by that 
                famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen 
                in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley.</p>
              <p>　　A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end 
                (they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view 
                of the Sunday crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond 
                the elms, the quay and the river; a magnificent August sunlight 
                lightly touching the panes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant 
                mountain of bouquets, mingled with the hats of men and women; 
                at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of 
                platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs of beer mingled with 
                flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorder 
                beneath it; </p>
              <p>　　 &quot;They made beneath the table A noise, a clatter of the 
                feet that was abominable,&quot;</p>
              <p>　　says Moliere.</p>
              <p>　　This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock 
                in the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon.The 
                sun was setting; their appetites were satisfied.</p>
              <p>　　The Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine and with people, were 
                nothing but light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed.The 
                horses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud 
                of gold.</p>
              <p>　　Carriages were going and coming.</p>
              <p>　　A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions 
                at their head, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white 
                flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the 
                dome of the Tuileries.The Place de la Concorde, which had become 
                the Place Louis XV.once more, was choked with happy promenaders.</p>
              <p>　　Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered 
                ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes 
                in the year 1817.Here and there choruses of little girls threw 
                to the winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles and 
                applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined 
                to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its 
                refrain:-- &quot;Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand, Rendez-nous notre 
                pere.&quot; &quot;Give us back our father from Ghent, Give us 
                back our father.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes 
                even decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered 
                over the large square and the Marigny square, were playing at 
                rings and revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged 
                in drinking; some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their 
                laughter was audible.Every thing was radiant.</p>
              <p>　　It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security; 
                it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of 
                Police Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, 
                terminated with these lines:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is 
                nothing to be feared from these people.</p>
              <p>　　They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.The populace is 
                restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris.These are very pretty 
                men, Sire.</p>
              <p>　　It would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers.</p>
              <p>　　There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of 
                Paris the capital.</p>
              <p>　　It is remarkable that the stature of this population should 
                have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of the 
                suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution.</p>
              <p>　　It is not dangerous.In short, it is an amiable rabble.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can 
                transform itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in 
                that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris.</p>
              <p>　　Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Angles possessed the 
                esteem of the republics of old.In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; 
                and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the 
                Piraeus, there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal 
                bronze figure of a cat.The ingenuous police of the Restoration 
                beheld the populace of Paris in too &quot;rose-colored&quot; a 
                light; it is not so much of &quot;an amiable rabble&quot; as it 
                is thought.</p>
              <p>　　The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the 
                Greek:</p>
              <p>　　no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly 
                frivolous and lazy than he, no one can better assume the air of 
                forgetfulness; let him not be trusted nevertheless; he is ready 
                for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory at the end 
                of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury.Give him 
                a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you 
                will have Austerlitz.</p>
              <p>　　He is Napoleon's stay and Danton's resource.Is it a question 
                of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears 
                up the pavements.</p>
              <p>　　Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes 
                itself like the folds of a chlamys.</p>
              <p>　　Take care! he will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes 
                to hand Caudine Forks.When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs 
                will grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze 
                will be terrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there 
                will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange 
                the folds of the Alps.It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, 
                that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe.</p>
              <p>　　He sings; it is his delight.Proportion his song to his nature, 
                and you will see!</p>
              <p>　　As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he 
                only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and 
                he will free the world.</p>
              <p>　　This note jotted down on the margin of Angles' report, we will 
                return to our four couples.</p>
              <p>　　The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close.</p>

              <p> 　　IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THE 
                DEVIL'S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY</p>
              <p> 　　Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate 
                in some detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about 
                the same epoch, in Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence 
                with certain conjectures of the indictment.</p>
              <p> 　　There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, 
                which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because 
                a popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe 
                in Siberia. We are among those who respect everything which is 
                in the nature of a rare plant.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought 
                that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest 
                as a hiding-place for his treasures.</p>
              <p> 　　Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, 
                in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a 
                carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers 
                and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead 
                of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head.</p>
              <p> 　　This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable.</p>
              <p> 　　This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. There are 
                three ways of profiting by such an encounter.</p>
              <p> 　　The first is to approach the man and speak to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he 
                appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging 
                any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that 
                what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which 
                he is carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective 
                of evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home 
                and dies within the week.</p>
              <p> 　　The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his 
                hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with 
                great speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the 
                &quot;treasure&quot; which the black man has necessarily placed 
                there.</p>
              <p> 　　In this case one dies within the month.</p>
              <p> 　　Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, 
                not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. 
                One then dies within the year.</p>
              <p> 　　As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, 
                the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among 
                others that of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is 
                the one most generally adopted.</p>
              <p> 　　So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, 
                as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, 
                and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears 
                to be but moderate.</p>
              <p> 　　At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in particular 
                the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman 
                monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject. 
                This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, 
                near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.</p>
              <p> 　　Accordingly, enormous efforts are made.</p>
              <p> 　　Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep; a man sweats, 
                digs, toils all night-- for it must be done at night; he wets 
                his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when 
                he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on 
                the &quot;treasure,&quot; what does he find? What is the devil's 
                treasure?</p>
              <p> 　　A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding 
                body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper 
                in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon's verses 
                seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:--&quot;Fodit, 
                et in fossa thesauros condit opaca, </p>
              <p> 　　As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn 
                with bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, 
                which has evidently served the devil.</p>
              <p> 　　Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived 
                in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to 
                have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon's time, and 
                cards before the time of Charles VI.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that 
                one possesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses 
                the property of making your gun burst in your face.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the 
                prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during 
                his flight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, 
                it was remarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, 
                named Boulatruelle, had &quot;peculiar ways&quot; in the forest.</p>
              <p> 　　People thereabouts thought they knew that this Boulatruelle 
                had been in the galleys. He was subjected to certain police supervision, 
                and, as he could find work nowhere, the administration employed 
                him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the cross-road from Gagny 
                to Lagny.</p>
              <p> 　　This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by 
                the inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, 
                too prompt in removing his cap to every one, and trembling and 
                smiling in the presence of the gendarmes,--probably affiliated 
                to robber bands, they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge 
                of copses at nightfall. The only thing in his favor was that he 
                was a drunkard.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what people thought they had noticed:--</p>
              <p> 　　Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking 
                and care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself 
                to the forest with his pickaxe.</p>
              <p> 　　He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings, 
                in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance of being in 
                search of something, and sometimes he was digging holes.</p>
              <p> 　　The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; 
                then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured 
                thereby.</p>
              <p> 　　These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was 
                some mystery in what he was doing.</p>
              <p> 　　It was said in the village:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is clear that the devil has appeared. Boulatruelle 
                has seen him, and is on the search.</p>
              <p> 　　In sooth, he is cunning enough to pocket Lucifer's hoard.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Voltairians added, &quot;Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, 
                or will the devil catch Boulatruelle?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old women made a great many signs of the cross.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, Boulatruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased; 
                and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people 
                gossiped of something else.</p>
              <p> 　　Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that 
                in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, 
                but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than 
                the devil's bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered 
                the secret.</p>
              <p> 　　The most &quot;puzzled&quot; were the school-master and Thenardier, 
                the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody's friend, and 
                had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has been in the galleys,&quot; said Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Eh!</p>
              <p> 　　Good God! no one knows who has been there or will be there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times 
                the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle 
                did in the forest, and that the latter would have been forced 
                to speak, and that he would have been put to the torture in case 
                of need, and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water 
                test, for example.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us put him to the wine test,&quot; said Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. 
                Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He 
                combined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the 
                thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, 
                by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting 
                together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him, 
                this is what Thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they 
                had made out:--</p>
              <p> 　　One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, 
                at daybreak, he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest 
                in the underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might 
                say.</p>
              <p> 　　However, he might have supposed that they were probably the 
                shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would 
                have thought no more about it.</p>
              <p> 　　But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seen 
                himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, &quot;a person who 
                did not belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew 
                well,&quot; directing his steps towards the densest part of the 
                wood.</p>
              <p> 　　Translation by Thenardier:</p>
              <p> 　　A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused 
                to reveal his name.</p>
              <p> 　　This person carried a package--something square, like a large 
                box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle.</p>
              <p> 　　However, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight 
                minutes that the idea of following that &quot;person&quot; had 
                occurred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, 
                night had descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch 
                up with him.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the 
                edge of the woods. &quot;It was moonlight.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person 
                emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but 
                a shovel and pick.</p>
              <p> 　　Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not dreamed 
                of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man 
                was three times as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, 
                and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing 
                him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion 
                of two old comrades on meeting again.</p>
              <p> 　　But the <br>
                shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; 
                he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had found neither 
                shovel nor pick.</p>
              <p> 　　From this he had drawn the inference that this person, once 
                in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, 
                and reclosed the hole with his shovel.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body; therefore 
                it contained money.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, 
                searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever 
                the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up.</p>
              <p> 　　In vain.</p>
              <p> 　　He had &quot;ferreted out&quot; nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　No one in Montfermeil thought any more about it.</p>
              <p> 　　There were only a few brave gossips, who said, &quot;You may 
                be certain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all 
                that trouble for nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.&quot;</p>

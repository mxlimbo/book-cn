              <p> 　　A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC </p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, 
                a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current.</p>
              <p> 　　Breaths which had started forth from the depths of '89 and 
                '93 were in the air.</p>
              <p> 　　Youth was on the point, may the reader pardon us the word, 
                of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, almost without 
                being conscious of it, through the movement of the age.</p>
              <p> 　　The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls.</p>
              <p> 　　Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound 
                to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning 
                democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb 
                movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; 
                hence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored both 
                Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here.</p>
              <p> 　　These were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases.</p>
              <p> 　　Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular 
                sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.</p>
              <p> 　　Other groups of minds were more serious.</p>
              <p> 　　In that direction, they sounded principles, they attached 
                themselves to the right. They grew enthusiastic for the absolute, 
                they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by 
                its very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causes them 
                to float in illimitable space. There is nothing like dogma for 
                bringing forth dreams.</p>
              <p> 　　And there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future.</p>
              <p> 　　Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.</p>
              <p> 　　These advanced opinions had a double foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　A beginning of mystery menaced &quot;the established order 
                of things,&quot; which was suspicious and underhand.</p>
              <p> 　　A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree.</p>
              <p> 　　The second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the 
                populace in the mine.</p>
              <p> 　　The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation 
                of coups d'etat.</p>
              <p> 　　There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying 
                organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; 
                but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in 
                process of throwing off shoots.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at 
                Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of 
                the Friends of the A B C.</p>
              <p> 　　What were these Friends of the A B C?</p>
              <p> 　　A society which had for its object apparently the education 
                of children, in reality the elevation of man.</p>
              <p> 　　They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,-- 
                the debased,--that is to say, the people.</p>
              <p> 　　They wished to elevate the people.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are 
                sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad 
                castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari 
                et Barberini; witness:</p>
              <p> 　　Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.</p>
              <p> 　　The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret 
                society in the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, 
                if coteries ended in heroes.</p>
              <p> 　　They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market, 
                in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later 
                on, and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel 
                called the Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places 
                was close to the workingman, the second to the students.</p>
              <p> 　　The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held 
                in a back room of the Cafe Musain.</p>
              <p> 　　This hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with 
                which it was connected by an extremely long corridor, had two 
                windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue 
                des Gres.</p>
              <p> 　　There they smoked and drank, and gambled and laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　There they conversed in very loud tones about everything, 
                and in whispers of other things. An old map of France under the 
                Republic was nailed to the wall,-- a sign quite sufficient to 
                excite the suspicion of a police agent.</p>
              <p> 　　The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, 
                who were on cordial terms with the working classes.</p>
              <p> 　　Here are the names of the principal ones.</p>
              <p> 　　They belong, in a certain measure, to history:</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, 
                Bahorel, Lesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond 
                of friendship.</p>
              <p> 　　All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.</p>
              <p> 　　This was a remarkable group.</p>
              <p> 　　It vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us.</p>
              <p> 　　At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it will 
                not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these 
                youthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the 
                shadow of a tragic adventure.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the 
                reader shall see why later on,--was an only son and wealthy.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being 
                terrible. He was angelically handsome.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a savage Antinous.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of 
                his glance, that he had already, in some previous state of existence, 
                traversed the revolutionary apocalypse.</p>
              <p> 　　He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness.</p>
              <p> 　　He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great 
                affair.</p>
              <p> 　　A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth.</p>
              <p> 　　He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate 
                point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary 
                movement, the priest of the ideal.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was 
                thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty.</p>
              <p> 　　A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon 
                in a view.</p>
              <p> 　　Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and 
                the end of the last, who became illustrious at an early age, he 
                was endowed with excessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl, 
                although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed 
                a child.</p>
              <p> 　　His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he 
                was serious, it did not seem as though he were aware there was 
                on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion--the right; 
                but one thought--to overthrow the obstacle.</p>
              <p> 　　On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, 
                he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored 
                spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat 
                of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved 
                Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing 
                except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments.</p>
              <p> 　　He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not 
                the Republic.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the marble lover of liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a hymn.</p>
              <p> 　　He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the 
                love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any 
                grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, 
                seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's 
                mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing 
                in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite 
                teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and 
                had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance 
                would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught 
                her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant 
                Cherubino of Beaumarchais.</p>
              <p> 　　By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the 
                Revolution, Combeferre represented its philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there 
                exists this difference--that its logic may end in war, whereas 
                its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferre complemented 
                and rectified Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　He was less lofty, but broader.</p>
              <p> 　　He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles 
                of general ideas:</p>
              <p> 　　he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Revolution, but civilization&quot;; and around the mountain 
                peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution 
                was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural 
                right.</p>
              <p> 　　The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined 
                himself to Condorcet.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more 
                than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men 
                to attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other 
                the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more 
                humane.</p>
              <p> 　　Homo and vir, that was the exact effect of their different 
                shades.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural 
                whiteness. He loved the word citizen, but he preferred the word 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　He would gladly have said:</p>
              <p> 　　Hombre, like the Spanish.</p>
              <p> 　　He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses 
                of public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, 
                grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire 
                explained the double function of the external carotid artery, 
                and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one which 
                makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science 
                step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, 
                broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology, drew 
                from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty French in 
                the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze, affirmed 
                nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned 
                over the files of the Moniteur, reflected.</p>
              <p> 　　He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, 
                and busied himself with educational questions.</p>
              <p> 　　He desired that society should labor without relaxation at 
                the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining 
                science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the 
                mind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty 
                of method, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined 
                to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism 
                of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should 
                end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds.</p>
              <p> 　　He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, 
                a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful &quot;even to 
                chimaeras,&quot; so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, 
                railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, 
                the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, 
                the steering of balloons.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected 
                against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism, 
                and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science will 
                eventually turn the position.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a guide. One would have 
                liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting, he 
                did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to 
                attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better 
                to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, 
                by means of education, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation 
                of positive laws; and, between two lights, his preference was 
                rather for illumination than for conflagration. A conflagration 
                can create an aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn?</p>
              <p> 　　A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a still better 
                illumination.</p>
              <p> 　　Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful 
                to the blaze of the sublime.</p>
              <p> 　　A light troubled by smoke, progress purchased at the expense 
                of violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a '93, 
                terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive 
                to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the whole, 
                he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the 
                cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, he desired neither halt nor haste.</p>
              <p> 　　While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute, 
                adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre 
                was inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; 
                he may have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable; 
                phlegmatic, but imperturbable.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable 
                the future to arrive in all its candor, and that nothing might 
                disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races.</p>
              <p> 　　The good must be innocent, he repeated incessantly. And in 
                fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the 
                dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart 
                the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty 
                of progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington, 
                who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, 
                that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the 
                wings of an eagle.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre.</p>
              <p> 　　His name was Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which 
                mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang 
                the very essential study of the Middle Ages.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, 
                played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied woman, 
                wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same 
                confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall 
                of a royal head, that of Andre Chenier. His voice was ordinarily 
                delicate, but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, 
                and almost an Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very 
                simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on 
                grandeur, in the matter of poetry, he preferred the immense.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and these served 
                him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, AEschylus, 
                and Isaiah.</p>
              <p> 　　In French, he preferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d'Aubigne 
                to Corneille. He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats 
                and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds nearly as much 
                as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the side towards 
                man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he contemplated.</p>
              <p> 　　All day long, he buried himself in social questions, salary, 
                capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought, education, 
                penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production and 
                sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human 
                ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, 
                those enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only 
                son.</p>
              <p> 　　He spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled 
                with embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed 
                at a mere nothing, and was very timid.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet he was intrepid.</p>
              <p> 　　Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father 
                and mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and 
                had but one thought, to deliver the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called 
                this also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read and 
                write; everything that he knew, he had learned by himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Feuilly had a generous heart.</p>
              <p> 　　The range of his embrace was immense.</p>
              <p> 　　This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed 
                him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound 
                divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the 
                idea of the nationality, had learned history with the express 
                object of raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club 
                of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, he represented 
                the outside world.</p>
              <p> 　　He had for his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, 
                Italy.</p>
              <p> 　　He uttered these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, 
                with the tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece 
                and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Above all things, the great violence of 1772 aroused him.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; 
                he was eloquent with that eloquence.</p>
              <p> 　　He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the 
                subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, 
                and that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype 
                and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, 
                since that time, have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled 
                their certificate of birth, so to speak. All contemporary social 
                crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland.</p>
              <p> 　　The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present 
                political outrages are the corollaries.</p>
              <p> 　　There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century 
                back, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, 
                ne variatur, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern 
                treasons was examined, that was the first thing which made its 
                appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating 
                its own.</p>
              <p> 　　1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game.</p>
              <p> 　　Such was Feuilly's habitual text. This poor workingman had 
                constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed 
                him by rendering him great.</p>
              <p> 　　The fact is, that there is eternity in right.</p>
              <p> 　　Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton.</p>
              <p> 　　Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make 
                them so.</p>
              <p> 　　Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface 
                and reappears.</p>
              <p> 　　Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy.</p>
              <p> 　　The protest of right against the deed persists forever.</p>
              <p> 　　The theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription.</p>
              <p> 　　These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. A nation cannot 
                have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration 
                as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the 
                particle. The particle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. 
                But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly 
                that poor de, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. 
                M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, 
                M. Caumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. 
                de Lafayette, M. Lafayette.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called 
                himself plain Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　We might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, 
                and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: &quot;For 
                Courfeyrac, see Tholomyes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may 
                be called the beaute du diable of the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten, 
                and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois, on two legs, and 
                with the tomcat, on four paws.</p>
              <p> 　　This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation 
                of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who 
                pass it from hand to hand, quasi cursores, and is almost always 
                exactly the same; so that, as we have just pointed out, any one 
                who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard 
                Tholomyes in 1817.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent 
                similarities of the exterior mind, the difference between him 
                and Tholomyes was very great.</p>
              <p> 　　The latent man which existed in the two was totally different 
                in the first from what it was in the second.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in Tholomyes a district attorney, and in Courfeyrac 
                a paladin.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac 
                was the centre.</p>
              <p> 　　The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth 
                is, that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness 
                and radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on 
                the occasion of the burial of young Lallemand.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, 
                a spendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, 
                and at times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best 
                fellow possible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; 
                a wholesale blusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much 
                as a quarrel, unless it were an uprising; and nothing so much 
                as an uprising, unless it were a revolution; always ready to smash 
                a window-pane, then to tear up the pavement, then to demolish 
                a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh 
                year. He had nosed about the law, but did not practise it.</p>
              <p> 　　He had taken for his device:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never a lawyer,&quot; and for his armorial bearings 
                a nightstand in which was visible a square cap.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, 
                he buttoned up his frock-coat,--the paletot had not yet been invented,--and 
                took hygienic precautions.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the school porter he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a fine old man!&quot; and of the dean, M. Delvincourt:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a monument!&quot; In his lectures he espied subjects 
                for ballads, and in his professors occasions for caricature.</p>
              <p> 　　He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like three 
                thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with 
                respect for their son.</p>
              <p> 　　He said of them:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the reason 
                they are intelligent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; 
                the others had habits, he had none.</p>
              <p> 　　He sauntered.</p>
              <p> 　　To stray is human. To saunter is Parisian.</p>
              <p> 　　In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker 
                than appeared to view.</p>
              <p> 　　He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the 
                A B C and other still unorganized groups, which were destined 
                to take form later on.</p>
              <p> 　　In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.</p>
              <p> 　　The Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　made a duke for having assisted him to enter a hackney-coach 
                on the day when he emigrated, was wont to relate, that in 1814, 
                on his return to France, as the King was disembarking at Calais, 
                a man handed him a petition.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your request?&quot; said the King.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, a post-office.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;L'Aigle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition 
                and beheld the name written thus:</p>
              <p> 　　LESGLE.</p>
              <p> 　　This non-Bonoparte orthography touched the King and he began 
                to smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire,&quot; resumed the man with the petition, &quot;I 
                had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed Lesgueules.</p>
              <p> 　　This surname furnished my name.</p>
              <p> 　　I am called Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, and by corruption 
                l'Aigle.&quot; This caused the King to smile broadly.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux, either 
                intentionally or accidentally.</p>
              <p> 　　The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or 
                Legle, and he signed himself, Legle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, 
                his companions called him Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow.</p>
              <p> 　　His specialty was not to succeed in anything.</p>
              <p> 　　As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty 
                he was bald.</p>
              <p> 　　His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but he, 
                the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad 
                speculation.</p>
              <p> 　　He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but all 
                he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived 
                him; what he was building tumbled down on top of him.</p>
              <p> 　　If he were splitting wood, he cut off a finger.</p>
              <p> 　　If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he had a 
                friend also.</p>
              <p> 　　Some misfortune happened to him every moment, hence his joviality.</p>
              <p> 　　He said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I live under falling tiles.&quot; He was not easily 
                astonished, because, for him, an accident was what he had foreseen, 
                he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of fate, 
                like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but 
                his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his 
                last sou, never his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered 
                his doors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped 
                all catastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality 
                to the point of calling it by its nickname: &quot;Good day, Guignon,&quot; 
                he said to it.</p>
              <p> 　　These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive.</p>
              <p> 　　He was full of resources.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good to 
                him, to indulge in &quot;unbridled extravagance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One night, he went so far as to eat a &quot;hundred francs&quot; 
                in a supper with a wench, which inspired him to make this memorable 
                remark in the midst of the orgy:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pull off my boots, you five-louis jade.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession 
                of a lawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner 
                of Bahorel.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged 
                now with one, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was 
                studying medicine.</p>
              <p> 　　He was two years younger than Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　Joly was the &quot;malade imaginaire&quot; junior.</p>
              <p> 　　What he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than 
                a doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　At three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian, and 
                passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and in 
                his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and 
                the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his 
                blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current 
                of the globe.</p>
              <p> 　　During thunder storms, he felt his pulse.</p>
              <p> 　　Otherwise, he was the gayest of them all. All these young, 
                maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived in harmony together, 
                and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades, 
                who were prodigal of winged consonants, called Jolllly . &quot;You 
                may fly away on the four L's,&quot; Jean Prouvaire said to him.[23]</p>
              <p> 　　[23] L'Aile, wing.</p>
              <p> 　　 Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his 
                cane, which is an indication of a sagacious mind.</p>
              <p> 　　All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the 
                whole, can only be discussed seriously, held the same religion:</p>
              <p> 　　Progress.</p>
              <p> 　　All were the direct sons of the French Revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　The most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced 
                that date:</p>
              <p> 　　'89.</p>
              <p> 　　Their fathers in the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, 
                it matters not what; this confusion anterior to themselves, who 
                were young, did not concern them at all; the pure blood of principle 
                ran in their veins.</p>
              <p> 　　They attached themselves, without intermediate shades, to 
                incorruptible right and absolute duty.</p>
              <p> 　　Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.</p>
              <p> 　　Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, 
                there was one sceptic.</p>
              <p> 　　How came he there?</p>
              <p> 　　By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name was Grantaire, and he 
                was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus:</p>
              <p> 　　R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in 
                anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most 
                during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was 
                to be had at the Cafe Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe 
                Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, 
                on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, 
                excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette, and a certain 
                thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew the best place for everything; in addition, boxing 
                and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick 
                player.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely:</p>
              <p> 　　the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged 
                with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as follows:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grantaire is impossible&quot;; but Grantaire's fatuity 
                was not to be disconcerted.</p>
              <p> 　　He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air 
                of saying to them all:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I only chose!&quot; and of trying to make his comrades 
                believe that he was in general demand.</p>
              <p> 　　All those words:</p>
              <p> 　　rights of the people, rights of man, the social contract, 
                the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity, civilization, 
                religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing whatever 
                to Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, 
                had not left him a single whole idea.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived with irony.</p>
              <p> 　　This was his axiom: &quot;There is but one certainty, my full 
                glass.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well 
                as the brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are greatly in advance to be dead,&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　He said of the crucifix:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is a gibbet which has been a success.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, he displeased 
                these young dreamers by humming incessantly: &quot;J'aimons les 
                filles, et j'aimons le bon vin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Air:</p>
              <p> 　　Vive Henri IV.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this sceptic had one fanaticism.</p>
              <p> 　　This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, 
                nor a science; it was a man:</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom 
                did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute 
                minds?</p>
              <p> 　　To the most absolute.</p>
              <p> 　　In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him?</p>
              <p> 　　By his ideas?</p>
              <p> 　　No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable.</p>
              <p> 　　A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law 
                of complementary colors.</p>
              <p> 　　That which we lack attracts us.</p>
              <p> 　　No one loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores 
                the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　In order to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whom 
                writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He had need 
                of Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmed 
                him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea 
                of explaining it to himself having occurred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He admired his opposite by instinct.</p>
              <p> 　　His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached 
                themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column.</p>
              <p> 　　His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. Grantaire in the 
                presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He was, himself, 
                moreover, composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, 
                incompatible.</p>
              <p> 　　He was ironical and cordial. His indifference loved.</p>
              <p> 　　His mind could get along without belief, but his heart could 
                not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for 
                an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted.</p>
              <p> 　　There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, 
                the wrong side.</p>
              <p> 　　They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja.</p>
              <p> 　　They only exist on condition that they are backed up with 
                another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded 
                by the conjunction and; and their existence is not their own; 
                it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters 
                of the alphabet.</p>
              <p> 　　In the series O and P are inseparable.</p>
              <p> 　　You can, at will, pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire, Enjolras' true satellite, inhabited this circle 
                of young men; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but 
                there; he followed them everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes 
                of wine.</p>
              <p> 　　They tolerated him on account of his good humor.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober 
                man himself, scorned this drunkard.</p>
              <p> 　　He accorded him a little lofty pity.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades.</p>
              <p> 　　Always harshly treated by Enjolras, roughly repulsed, rejected 
                yet ever returning to the charge, he said of Enjolras:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What fine marble!&quot;</p>
            　　A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC 
              <p> 　　At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, 
                a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current.</p>
              <p> 　　Breaths which had started forth from the depths of '89 and 
                '93 were in the air.</p>
              <p> 　　Youth was on the point, may the reader pardon us the word, 
                of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, almost without 
                being conscious of it, through the movement of the age.</p>
              <p> 　　The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls.</p>
              <p> 　　Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound 
                to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning 
                democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb 
                movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; 
                hence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored both 
                Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here.</p>
              <p> 　　These were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases.</p>
              <p> 　　Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular 
                sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.</p>
              <p> 　　Other groups of minds were more serious.</p>
              <p> 　　In that direction, they sounded principles, they attached 
                themselves to the right. They grew enthusiastic for the absolute, 
                they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by 
                its very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causes them 
                to float in illimitable space. There is nothing like dogma for 
                bringing forth dreams.</p>
              <p> 　　And there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future.</p>
              <p> 　　Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.</p>
              <p> 　　These advanced opinions had a double foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　A beginning of mystery menaced &quot;the established order 
                of things,&quot; which was suspicious and underhand.</p>
              <p> 　　A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree.</p>
              <p> 　　The second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the 
                populace in the mine.</p>
              <p> 　　The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation 
                of coups d'etat.</p>
              <p> 　　There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying 
                organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; 
                but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in 
                process of throwing off shoots.</p>
              <p> 　　The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at 
                Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of 
                the Friends of the A B C.</p>
              <p> 　　What were these Friends of the A B C?</p>
              <p> 　　A society which had for its object apparently the education 
                of children, in reality the elevation of man.</p>
              <p> 　　They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,-- 
                the debased,--that is to say, the people.</p>
              <p> 　　They wished to elevate the people.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are 
                sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad 
                castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari 
                et Barberini; witness:</p>
              <p> 　　Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.</p>
              <p> 　　The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret 
                society in the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, 
                if coteries ended in heroes.</p>
              <p> 　　They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market, 
                in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later 
                on, and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel 
                called the Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places 
                was close to the workingman, the second to the students.</p>
              <p> 　　The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held 
                in a back room of the Cafe Musain.</p>
              <p> 　　This hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with 
                which it was connected by an extremely long corridor, had two 
                windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue 
                des Gres.</p>
              <p> 　　There they smoked and drank, and gambled and laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　There they conversed in very loud tones about everything, 
                and in whispers of other things. An old map of France under the 
                Republic was nailed to the wall,-- a sign quite sufficient to 
                excite the suspicion of a police agent.</p>
              <p> 　　The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, 
                who were on cordial terms with the working classes.</p>
              <p> 　　Here are the names of the principal ones.</p>
              <p> 　　They belong, in a certain measure, to history:</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, 
                Bahorel, Lesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond 
                of friendship.</p>
              <p> 　　All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.</p>
              <p> 　　This was a remarkable group.</p>
              <p> 　　It vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us.</p>
              <p> 　　At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it will 
                not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these 
                youthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the 
                shadow of a tragic adventure.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the 
                reader shall see why later on,--was an only son and wealthy.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being 
                terrible. He was angelically handsome.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a savage Antinous.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of 
                his glance, that he had already, in some previous state of existence, 
                traversed the revolutionary apocalypse.</p>
              <p> 　　He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness.</p>
              <p> 　　He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great 
                affair.</p>
              <p> 　　A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth.</p>
              <p> 　　He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate 
                point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary 
                movement, the priest of the ideal.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was 
                thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty.</p>
              <p> 　　A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon 
                in a view.</p>
              <p> 　　Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and 
                the end of the last, who became illustrious at an early age, he 
                was endowed with excessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl, 
                although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed 
                a child.</p>
              <p> 　　His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he 
                was serious, it did not seem as though he were aware there was 
                on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion--the right; 
                but one thought--to overthrow the obstacle.</p>
              <p> 　　On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, 
                he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored 
                spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat 
                of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved 
                Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing 
                except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments.</p>
              <p> 　　He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not 
                the Republic.</p>
              <p> 　　He was the marble lover of liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a hymn.</p>
              <p> 　　He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the 
                love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any 
                grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, 
                seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's 
                mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing 
                in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite 
                teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and 
                had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance 
                would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught 
                her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant 
                Cherubino of Beaumarchais.</p>
              <p> 　　By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the 
                Revolution, Combeferre represented its philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there 
                exists this difference--that its logic may end in war, whereas 
                its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferre complemented 
                and rectified Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　He was less lofty, but broader.</p>
              <p> 　　He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles 
                of general ideas:</p>
              <p> 　　he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Revolution, but civilization&quot;; and around the mountain 
                peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution 
                was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural 
                right.</p>
              <p> 　　The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined 
                himself to Condorcet.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more 
                than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men 
                to attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other 
                the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more 
                humane.</p>
              <p> 　　Homo and vir, that was the exact effect of their different 
                shades.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural 
                whiteness. He loved the word citizen, but he preferred the word 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　He would gladly have said:</p>
              <p> 　　Hombre, like the Spanish.</p>
              <p> 　　He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses 
                of public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, 
                grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire 
                explained the double function of the external carotid artery, 
                and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one which 
                makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science 
                step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, 
                broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology, drew 
                from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty French in 
                the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze, affirmed 
                nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned 
                over the files of the Moniteur, reflected.</p>
              <p> 　　He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, 
                and busied himself with educational questions.</p>
              <p> 　　He desired that society should labor without relaxation at 
                the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining 
                science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the 
                mind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty 
                of method, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined 
                to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism 
                of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should 
                end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds.</p>
              <p> 　　He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, 
                a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful &quot;even to 
                chimaeras,&quot; so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, 
                railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, 
                the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, 
                the steering of balloons.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected 
                against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism, 
                and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science will 
                eventually turn the position.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a guide. One would have 
                liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting, he 
                did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to 
                attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better 
                to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, 
                by means of education, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation 
                of positive laws; and, between two lights, his preference was 
                rather for illumination than for conflagration. A conflagration 
                can create an aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn?</p>
              <p> 　　A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a still better 
                illumination.</p>
              <p> 　　Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful 
                to the blaze of the sublime.</p>
              <p> 　　A light troubled by smoke, progress purchased at the expense 
                of violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a '93, 
                terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive 
                to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the whole, 
                he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the 
                cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, he desired neither halt nor haste.</p>
              <p> 　　While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute, 
                adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre 
                was inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; 
                he may have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable; 
                phlegmatic, but imperturbable.</p>
              <p> 　　Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable 
                the future to arrive in all its candor, and that nothing might 
                disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races.</p>
              <p> 　　The good must be innocent, he repeated incessantly. And in 
                fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the 
                dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart 
                the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty 
                of progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington, 
                who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, 
                that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the 
                wings of an eagle.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre.</p>
              <p> 　　His name was Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which 
                mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang 
                the very essential study of the Middle Ages.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, 
                played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied woman, 
                wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same 
                confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall 
                of a royal head, that of Andre Chenier. His voice was ordinarily 
                delicate, but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, 
                and almost an Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very 
                simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on 
                grandeur, in the matter of poetry, he preferred the immense.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and these served 
                him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, AEschylus, 
                and Isaiah.</p>
              <p> 　　In French, he preferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d'Aubigne 
                to Corneille. He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats 
                and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds nearly as much 
                as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the side towards 
                man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he contemplated.</p>
              <p> 　　All day long, he buried himself in social questions, salary, 
                capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought, education, 
                penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production and 
                sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human 
                ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, 
                those enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only 
                son.</p>
              <p> 　　He spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled 
                with embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed 
                at a mere nothing, and was very timid.</p>
              <p> 　　Yet he was intrepid.</p>
              <p> 　　Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father 
                and mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and 
                had but one thought, to deliver the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called 
                this also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read and 
                write; everything that he knew, he had learned by himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Feuilly had a generous heart.</p>
              <p> 　　The range of his embrace was immense.</p>
              <p> 　　This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed 
                him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound 
                divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the 
                idea of the nationality, had learned history with the express 
                object of raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club 
                of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, he represented 
                the outside world.</p>
              <p> 　　He had for his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, 
                Italy.</p>
              <p> 　　He uttered these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, 
                with the tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece 
                and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Above all things, the great violence of 1772 aroused him.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; 
                he was eloquent with that eloquence.</p>
              <p> 　　He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the 
                subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, 
                and that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype 
                and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, 
                since that time, have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled 
                their certificate of birth, so to speak. All contemporary social 
                crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland.</p>
              <p> 　　The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present 
                political outrages are the corollaries.</p>
              <p> 　　There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century 
                back, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, 
                ne variatur, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern 
                treasons was examined, that was the first thing which made its 
                appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating 
                its own.</p>
              <p> 　　1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game.</p>
              <p> 　　Such was Feuilly's habitual text. This poor workingman had 
                constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed 
                him by rendering him great.</p>
              <p> 　　The fact is, that there is eternity in right.</p>
              <p> 　　Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton.</p>
              <p> 　　Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make 
                them so.</p>
              <p> 　　Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface 
                and reappears.</p>
              <p> 　　Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy.</p>
              <p> 　　The protest of right against the deed persists forever.</p>
              <p> 　　The theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription.</p>
              <p> 　　These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. A nation cannot 
                have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration 
                as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the 
                particle. The particle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. 
                But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly 
                that poor de, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. 
                M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, 
                M. Caumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. 
                de Lafayette, M. Lafayette.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called 
                himself plain Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　We might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, 
                and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: &quot;For 
                Courfeyrac, see Tholomyes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may 
                be called the beaute du diable of the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten, 
                and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois, on two legs, and 
                with the tomcat, on four paws.</p>
              <p> 　　This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation 
                of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who 
                pass it from hand to hand, quasi cursores, and is almost always 
                exactly the same; so that, as we have just pointed out, any one 
                who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard 
                Tholomyes in 1817.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent 
                similarities of the exterior mind, the difference between him 
                and Tholomyes was very great.</p>
              <p> 　　The latent man which existed in the two was totally different 
                in the first from what it was in the second.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in Tholomyes a district attorney, and in Courfeyrac 
                a paladin.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac 
                was the centre.</p>
              <p> 　　The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth 
                is, that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness 
                and radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on 
                the occasion of the burial of young Lallemand.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, 
                a spendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, 
                and at times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best 
                fellow possible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; 
                a wholesale blusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much 
                as a quarrel, unless it were an uprising; and nothing so much 
                as an uprising, unless it were a revolution; always ready to smash 
                a window-pane, then to tear up the pavement, then to demolish 
                a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh 
                year. He had nosed about the law, but did not practise it.</p>
              <p> 　　He had taken for his device:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never a lawyer,&quot; and for his armorial bearings 
                a nightstand in which was visible a square cap.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, 
                he buttoned up his frock-coat,--the paletot had not yet been invented,--and 
                took hygienic precautions.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the school porter he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a fine old man!&quot; and of the dean, M. Delvincourt:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What a monument!&quot; In his lectures he espied subjects 
                for ballads, and in his professors occasions for caricature.</p>
              <p> 　　He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like three 
                thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with 
                respect for their son.</p>
              <p> 　　He said of them:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the reason 
                they are intelligent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; 
                the others had habits, he had none.</p>
              <p> 　　He sauntered.</p>
              <p> 　　To stray is human. To saunter is Parisian.</p>
              <p> 　　In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker 
                than appeared to view.</p>
              <p> 　　He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the 
                A B C and other still unorganized groups, which were destined 
                to take form later on.</p>
              <p> 　　In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.</p>
              <p> 　　The Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　made a duke for having assisted him to enter a hackney-coach 
                on the day when he emigrated, was wont to relate, that in 1814, 
                on his return to France, as the King was disembarking at Calais, 
                a man handed him a petition.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your request?&quot; said the King.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire, a post-office.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;L'Aigle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition 
                and beheld the name written thus:</p>
              <p> 　　LESGLE.</p>
              <p> 　　This non-Bonoparte orthography touched the King and he began 
                to smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire,&quot; resumed the man with the petition, &quot;I 
                had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed Lesgueules.</p>
              <p> 　　This surname furnished my name.</p>
              <p> 　　I am called Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, and by corruption 
                l'Aigle.&quot; This caused the King to smile broadly.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux, either 
                intentionally or accidentally.</p>
              <p> 　　The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or 
                Legle, and he signed himself, Legle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, 
                his companions called him Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow.</p>
              <p> 　　His specialty was not to succeed in anything.</p>
              <p> 　　As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty 
                he was bald.</p>
              <p> 　　His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but he, 
                the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad 
                speculation.</p>
              <p> 　　He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but all 
                he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived 
                him; what he was building tumbled down on top of him.</p>
              <p> 　　If he were splitting wood, he cut off a finger.</p>
              <p> 　　If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he had a 
                friend also.</p>
              <p> 　　Some misfortune happened to him every moment, hence his joviality.</p>
              <p> 　　He said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I live under falling tiles.&quot; He was not easily 
                astonished, because, for him, an accident was what he had foreseen, 
                he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of fate, 
                like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but 
                his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his 
                last sou, never his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered 
                his doors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped 
                all catastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality 
                to the point of calling it by its nickname: &quot;Good day, Guignon,&quot; 
                he said to it.</p>
              <p> 　　These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive.</p>
              <p> 　　He was full of resources.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good to 
                him, to indulge in &quot;unbridled extravagance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One night, he went so far as to eat a &quot;hundred francs&quot; 
                in a supper with a wench, which inspired him to make this memorable 
                remark in the midst of the orgy:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pull off my boots, you five-louis jade.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession 
                of a lawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner 
                of Bahorel.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged 
                now with one, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was 
                studying medicine.</p>
              <p> 　　He was two years younger than Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　Joly was the &quot;malade imaginaire&quot; junior.</p>
              <p> 　　What he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than 
                a doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　At three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian, and 
                passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and in 
                his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and 
                the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his 
                blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current 
                of the globe.</p>
              <p> 　　During thunder storms, he felt his pulse.</p>
              <p> 　　Otherwise, he was the gayest of them all. All these young, 
                maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived in harmony together, 
                and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades, 
                who were prodigal of winged consonants, called Jolllly . &quot;You 
                may fly away on the four L's,&quot; Jean Prouvaire said to him.[23]</p>
              <p> 　　[23] L'Aile, wing.</p>
              <p> 　　 Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his 
                cane, which is an indication of a sagacious mind.</p>
              <p> 　　All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the 
                whole, can only be discussed seriously, held the same religion:</p>
              <p> 　　Progress.</p>
              <p> 　　All were the direct sons of the French Revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　The most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced 
                that date:</p>
              <p> 　　'89.</p>
              <p> 　　Their fathers in the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, 
                it matters not what; this confusion anterior to themselves, who 
                were young, did not concern them at all; the pure blood of principle 
                ran in their veins.</p>
              <p> 　　They attached themselves, without intermediate shades, to 
                incorruptible right and absolute duty.</p>
              <p> 　　Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.</p>
              <p> 　　Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, 
                there was one sceptic.</p>
              <p> 　　How came he there?</p>
              <p> 　　By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name was Grantaire, and he 
                was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus:</p>
              <p> 　　R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in 
                anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most 
                during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was 
                to be had at the Cafe Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe 
                Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, 
                on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, 
                excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette, and a certain 
                thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew the best place for everything; in addition, boxing 
                and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick 
                player.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely:</p>
              <p> 　　the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged 
                with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as follows:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Grantaire is impossible&quot;; but Grantaire's fatuity 
                was not to be disconcerted.</p>
              <p> 　　He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air 
                of saying to them all:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I only chose!&quot; and of trying to make his comrades 
                believe that he was in general demand.</p>
              <p> 　　All those words:</p>
              <p> 　　rights of the people, rights of man, the social contract, 
                the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity, civilization, 
                religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing whatever 
                to Grantaire.</p>
              <p> 　　He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, 
                had not left him a single whole idea.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived with irony.</p>
              <p> 　　This was his axiom: &quot;There is but one certainty, my full 
                glass.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well 
                as the brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are greatly in advance to be dead,&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　He said of the crucifix:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is a gibbet which has been a success.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, he displeased 
                these young dreamers by humming incessantly: &quot;J'aimons les 
                filles, et j'aimons le bon vin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Air:</p>
              <p> 　　Vive Henri IV.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this sceptic had one fanaticism.</p>
              <p> 　　This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, 
                nor a science; it was a man:</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom 
                did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute 
                minds?</p>
              <p> 　　To the most absolute.</p>
              <p> 　　In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him?</p>
              <p> 　　By his ideas?</p>
              <p> 　　No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable.</p>
              <p> 　　A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law 
                of complementary colors.</p>
              <p> 　　That which we lack attracts us.</p>
              <p> 　　No one loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores 
                the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　In order to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whom 
                writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He had need 
                of Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmed 
                him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea 
                of explaining it to himself having occurred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He admired his opposite by instinct.</p>
              <p> 　　His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached 
                themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column.</p>
              <p> 　　His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. Grantaire in the 
                presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He was, himself, 
                moreover, composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, 
                incompatible.</p>
              <p> 　　He was ironical and cordial. His indifference loved.</p>
              <p> 　　His mind could get along without belief, but his heart could 
                not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for 
                an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted.</p>
              <p> 　　There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, 
                the wrong side.</p>
              <p> 　　They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja.</p>
              <p> 　　They only exist on condition that they are backed up with 
                another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded 
                by the conjunction and; and their existence is not their own; 
                it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters 
                of the alphabet.</p>
              <p> 　　In the series O and P are inseparable.</p>
              <p> 　　You can, at will, pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire, Enjolras' true satellite, inhabited this circle 
                of young men; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but 
                there; he followed them everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes 
                of wine.</p>
              <p> 　　They tolerated him on account of his good humor.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober 
                man himself, scorned this drunkard.</p>
              <p> 　　He accorded him a little lofty pity.</p>
              <p> 　　Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades.</p>
              <p> 　　Always harshly treated by Enjolras, roughly repulsed, rejected 
                yet ever returning to the charge, he said of Enjolras:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What fine marble!&quot;</p>

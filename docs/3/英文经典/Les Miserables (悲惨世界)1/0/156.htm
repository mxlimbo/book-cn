              <p> 　　 IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE LAST 
                KING</p>
              <p> 　　 In summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the 
                evening, when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz 
                and Jena, from the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen's 
                boats, he hurls himself headlong into the Seine, and into all 
                possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him, and the result 
                is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal 
                and memorable cry; that cry which was celebrated about 1830, is 
                a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it scans like a verse 
                from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant 
                of the Panathenaea, and in it one encounters again the ancient 
                Evohe.</p>
              <p> 　　Here it is: &quot;Ohe, Titi, oheee!</p>
              <p> 　　Here comes the bobby, here comes the p'lice, pick up your 
                duds and be off, through the sewer with you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes this gnat--that is what he calls himself--knows 
                how to read; sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows 
                how to daub. He does not hesitate to acquire, by no one knows 
                what mysterious mutual instruction, all the talents which can 
                be of use to the public; from 1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry 
                of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he scrawled pears on the walls.</p>
              <p> 　　One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was returning home 
                on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee, perspiring 
                and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of 
                the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature 
                which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the 
                pear, and gave the child a louis, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The pear is on that also.&quot;[19] The gamin loves 
                uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him.</p>
              <p> 　　He execrates &quot;the cures.&quot; One day, in the Rue de 
                l'Universite, one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his 
                nose at the carriage gate of No. 69.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why are you doing that at the gate?&quot; a passer-by 
                asked.</p>
              <p> 　　The boy replied: &quot;There is a cure there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was there, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived.</p>
              <p> 　　 [19] Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　is represented in comic pictures of that day as having a pear-shaped 
                head.</p>
              <p> 　　 Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small 
                gamin, if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, 
                it is quite possible that he will accept, and in that case he 
                serves the mass civilly.</p>
              <p> 　　There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which 
                he always desires without ever attaining them: to overthrow the 
                government, and to get his trousers sewed up again.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen 
                of Paris, and can always put the name to the face of any one which 
                he chances to meet.</p>
              <p> 　　He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies 
                their habits, and he has special notes on each one of them.</p>
              <p> 　　He reads the souls of the police like an open book. He will 
                tell you fluently and without flinching:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Such an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious; 
                such another is great; such another is ridiculous.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　(All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have 
                a particular meaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he 
                owns the Pont-Neuf, and he prevents people from walking on the 
                cornice outside the parapet; that other has a mania for pulling 
                person's ears; etc., etc.</p>

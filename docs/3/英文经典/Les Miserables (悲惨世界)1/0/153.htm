              <p> 　　HIS FRONTIERS</p>
              <p> 　　 The gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he 
                has something of the sage in him.</p>
              <p> 　　Urbis amator, like Fuscus; ruris amator, like Flaccus.</p>
              <p> 　　To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is 
                a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly 
                in that rather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably 
                ugly but odd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain 
                great cities, notably Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.</p>
              <p> 　　End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, 
                beginning of the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the 
                shops, end of the wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of 
                the divine murmur, beginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary 
                interest.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped 
                by the passing stroller with the epithet:</p>
              <p> 　　melancholy, the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer.</p>
              <p> 　　He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the 
                barriers of Paris, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. 
                That close-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those 
                pools, those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants 
                of early market-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, 
                that mixture of the savage and the citizen, those vast desert 
                nooks where the garrison drums practise noisily, and produce a 
                sort of lisping of battle, those hermits by day and cut-throats 
                by night, that clumsy mill which turns in the wind, the hoisting-wheels 
                of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the corners of the cemeteries; 
                the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls squarely intersecting 
                immense, vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full 
                of butterflies,--all this attracted him.</p>
              <p> 　　There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with 
                those singular spots, the Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall 
                of Grenelle all speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, 
                Aubiers on the bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, 
                the Pierre-Plate de Chatillon, where there is an old, exhausted 
                quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, 
                and which is closed, on a level with the ground, by a trap-door 
                of rotten planks. The campagna of Rome is one idea, the banlieue 
                of Paris is another; to behold nothing but fields, houses, or 
                trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is to remain on 
                the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God.</p>
              <p> 　　The spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is 
                always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and 
                humanity both appeal to you at the same time there. Local originalities 
                there make their appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes 
                contiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos 
                of Paris, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at 
                the most unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner 
                of a lugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, 
                dusty, ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned 
                with corn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their 
                escape from poor families.</p>
              <p> 　　The outer boulevard is their breathing space; the suburbs 
                belong to them.</p>
              <p> 　　There they are eternally playing truant. There they innocently 
                sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or rather, 
                there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of May 
                or June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles 
                with their thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, 
                volatile, free and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of 
                you than they recollect that they have an industry, and that they 
                must earn their living, and they offer to sell you an old woollen 
                stocking filled with cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These 
                encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at 
                the same time poignant graces of the environs of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,-- 
                are they their sisters?--who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, 
                with sunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies 
                and ears of rye, gay, haggard, barefooted.</p>
              <p> 　　They can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups, warmly 
                illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen in 
                the twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, 
                and these visions mingle with his dreams.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all 
                the earth to those children.</p>
              <p> 　　They never venture beyond this. They can no more escape from 
                the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water.</p>
              <p> 　　For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers:</p>
              <p> 　　Ivry, Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Menilmontant, 
                Choisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Mendon, Issy, Vanvre, Sevres, Puteaux, 
                Neuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnieres, 
                Bougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy, 
                Gonesse; the universe ends there.</p>

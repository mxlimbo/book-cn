              <p> 　　In 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of 
                D---- He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he 
                had occupied the see of D---- since 1806.</p>
              <p> 　　Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real 
                substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, 
                if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention 
                here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation 
                about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.</p>
              <p> 　　True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as 
                important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, 
                as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of 
                the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the 
                bar.</p>
              <p> 　　It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir 
                of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen 
                or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely 
                prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, 
                however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal 
                of talk.</p>
              <p> 　　He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, 
                graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life 
                had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.</p>
              <p> 　　The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; 
                the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were 
                dispersed.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning 
                of the Revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she 
                had long suffered.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. 
                Myriel?</p>
              <p> 　　The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall 
                of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, 
                even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, 
                with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas 
                of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections 
                which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious 
                and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his 
                heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking 
                at his existence and his fortune?</p>
              <p> 　　No one could have told:</p>
              <p> 　　all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he 
                was a priest.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He 
                was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.</p>
              <p> 　　About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected 
                with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to 
                Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid 
                for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the 
                worthy Cure, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present 
                when His Majesty passed.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity 
                by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is this good man who is staring at me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sire,&quot; said M. Myriel, &quot;you are looking at 
                a good man, and I at a great man.</p>
              <p> 　　Each of us can profit by it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name 
                of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished 
                to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----</p>
              <p> 　　What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were 
                invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life?</p>
              <p> 　　No one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the 
                Myriel family before the Revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little 
                town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads 
                which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, 
                and because he was a bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected 
                were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, 
                as the energetic language of the South expresses it.</p>
              <p> 　　However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and 
                of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation 
                which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen 
                into profound oblivion.</p>
              <p> 　　No one would have dared to mention them; no one would have 
                dared to recall them.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, 
                Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his 
                junior.</p>
              <p> 　　Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as 
                Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after 
                having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double 
                title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.</p>
              <p> 　　Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; 
                she realized the ideal expressed by the word &quot;respectable&quot;; 
                for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be 
                venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had 
                been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred 
                upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced 
                in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. 
                What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in 
                her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. 
                She was a soul rather than a virgin.</p>
              <p> 　　Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient 
                body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large 
                eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining 
                on the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent 
                and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because 
                of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.</p>
              <p> 　　On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace 
                with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class 
                a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the 
                president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the 
                first call on the general and the prefect.</p>
              <p> 　　The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at 
                work.</p>

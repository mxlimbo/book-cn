              <p> 　　THE UNEXPECTED</p>
              <p> 　　 There were three thousand five hundred of them.</p>
              <p> 　　They formed a front a quarter of a league in extent.</p>
              <p> 　　They were giant men, on colossal horses.</p>
              <p> 　　There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had 
                behind them to support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes's division,--the 
                one hundred and six picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the 
                Guard, eleven hundred and ninety-seven men, and the lancers of 
                the guard of eight hundred and eighty lances. They wore casques 
                without horse-tails, and cuirasses of beaten iron, with horse-pistols 
                in their holsters, and long sabre-swords. That morning the whole 
                army had admired them, when, at nine o'clock, with braying of 
                trumpets and all the music playing &quot;Let us watch o'er the 
                Safety of the Empire,&quot; they had come in a solid column, with 
                one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, 
                and deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont, 
                and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second 
                line, so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on its extreme 
                left Kellermann's cuirassiers and on its extreme right Milhaud's 
                cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings of iron.</p>
              <p> 　　Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor's orders.</p>
              <p> 　　Ney drew his sword and placed himself at their head.</p>
              <p> 　　The enormous squadrons were set in motion.</p>
              <p> 　　Then a formidable spectacle was seen.</p>
              <p> 　　All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets 
                flung to the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, 
                by a simultaneous movement and like one man, with the precision 
                of a brazen battering-ram which is effecting a breach, the hill 
                of La Belle Alliance, plunged into the terrible depths in which 
                so many men had already fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, 
                then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the other side of 
                the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting at a full 
                trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them, the 
                terrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They 
                ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals 
                between the musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling 
                was audible. Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; 
                Wathier's division held the right, Delort's division was on the 
                left.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be 
                seen crawling towards the crest of the table-land. It traversed 
                the battle like a prodigy.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great 
                redoubt of the Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking 
                here, but Ney was again present.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had 
                but one soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp.</p>
              <p> 　　They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was 
                rent here and there.</p>
              <p> 　　A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy heaving 
                of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of 
                trumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses 
                like the scales on the hydra.</p>
              <p> 　　These narrations seemed to belong to another age.</p>
              <p> 　　Something parallel to this vision appeared, no doubt, in the 
                ancient Orphic epics, which told of the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, 
                those Titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled 
                Olympus at a gallop, horrible, invulnerable, sublime--gods and 
                beasts.</p>
              <p> 　　Odd numerical coincidence,--twenty-six battalions rode to 
                meet twenty-six battalions.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of the masked 
                battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares, two 
                battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first 
                line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders, 
                taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, 
                calm, mute, motionless.</p>
              <p> 　　They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers did 
                not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men.</p>
              <p> 　　They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the 
                alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the 
                jingling of the cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort 
                of grand and savage breathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; 
                then, all at once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, 
                appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, 
                and three thousand heads with gray mustaches, shouting, &quot;Vive 
                l'Empereur!&quot; All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and 
                it was like the appearance of an earthquake.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our 
                right, the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a 
                frightful clamor. On arriving at the culminating point of the 
                crest, ungovernable, utterly given over to fury and their course 
                of extermination of the squares and cannon, the cuirassiers had 
                just caught sight of a trench,-- a trench between them and the 
                English.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the hollow road of Ohain.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a terrible moment.</p>
              <p> 　　The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning, directly under 
                the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its double slopes; 
                the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed 
                on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on 
                their haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing 
                and overwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,-- 
                the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile,-- 
                the force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed 
                the French; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; 
                horses and riders rolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, 
                forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf:</p>
              <p> 　　when this trench was full of living men, the rest marched 
                over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois's brigade fell 
                into that abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　This began the loss of the battle.</p>
              <p> 　　A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says 
                that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in 
                the hollow road of Ohain.</p>
              <p> 　　This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which 
                were flung into this ravine the day after the combat.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us note in passing that it was Dubois's sorely tried brigade 
                which, an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured 
                the flag of the Lunenburg battalion.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud's 
                cuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able 
                to see that hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on 
                the surface of the plateau.</p>
              <p> 　　Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little white 
                chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, 
                he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, 
                to the guide Lacoste.</p>
              <p> 　　The guide had answered No. We might almost affirm that Napoleon's 
                catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant's head.</p>
              <p> 　　Other fatalities were destined to arise.</p>
              <p> 　　Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? 
                We answer No. Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because of Wellington?</p>
              <p> 　　Because of Blucher? No. Because of God.</p>
              <p> 　　Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the 
                law of the nineteenth century.</p>
              <p> 　　Another series of facts was in preparation, in which there 
                was no longer any room for Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　The ill will of events had declared itself long before.</p>
              <p> 　　It was time that this vast man should fall.</p>
              <p> 　　The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed 
                the balance. This individual alone counted for more than a universal 
                group. These plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a 
                single head; the world mounting to the brain of one man,--this 
                would be mortal to civilization were it to last.</p>
              <p> 　　The moment had arrived for the incorruptible and supreme equity 
                to alter its plan.</p>
              <p> 　　Probably the principles and the elements, on which the regular 
                gravitations of the moral, as of the material, world depend, had 
                complained. Smoking blood, over-filled cemeteries, mothers in 
                tears,-- these are formidable pleaders.</p>
              <p> 　　When the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there 
                are mysterious groanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends 
                an ear.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had 
                been decided on.</p>
              <p> 　　He embarrassed God.</p>
              <p> 　　Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part 
                of the Universe.</p>

              <p> 　　 He had theories.</p>
              <p> 　　Here is one of them:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When a man is passionately fond of women, and when he 
                has himself a wife for whom he cares but little, who is homely, 
                cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the code, 
                and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself 
                from the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his 
                wife control the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free.</p>
              <p> 　　Then his wife busies herself, grows passionately fond of handling 
                coin, gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process, 
                undertakes the education of half-share tenants and the training 
                of farmers, convokes lawyers, presides over notaries, harangues 
                scriveners, visits limbs of the law, follows lawsuits, draws up 
                leases, dictates contracts, feels herself the sovereign, sells, 
                buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fast and annuls, 
                yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges, hoards, 
                lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight, 
                and that consoles her.</p>
              <p> 　　While her husband disdains her, she has the satisfaction of 
                ruining her husband.&quot; This theory M. Gillenormand had himself 
                applied, and it had become his history.</p>
              <p> 　　His wife--the second one--had administered his fortune in 
                such a manner that, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found himself 
                a widower, there remained to him just sufficient to live on, by 
                sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand 
                francs, three-quarters of which would expire with him. He had 
                not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave a property 
                behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures, 
                and, for instance, become national property; he had been present 
                at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he had no 
                great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. &quot;All that's 
                the Rue Quincampois!&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavaire belonged to him, as 
                we have already stated. He had two servants, &quot;a male and 
                a female.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormand 
                re-baptized him.</p>
              <p> 　　He bestowed on the men the name of their province:</p>
              <p> 　　Nimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, 
                foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable 
                of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, 
                M. Gillenormand called him Basque.</p>
              <p> 　　All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette 
                (even the Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One 
                day, a haughty cook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, 
                presented herself. &quot;How much wages do you want a month?&quot; 
                asked M. Gillenormand. &quot;Thirty francs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Olympie.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You shall have fifty francs, and you shall be called 
                Nicolette.&quot;</p>

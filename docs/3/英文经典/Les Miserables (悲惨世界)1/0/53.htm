          <tr>

              <p> 　　THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE MUNICIPAL 
                POLICE</p>
              <p> 　　 Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and 
                set out with long strides towards the police station, which is 
                situated at the extremity of the square, dragging the wretched 
                woman after him. She yielded mechanically.</p>
              <p> 　　Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of spectators 
                followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery an 
                occasion for obscenity.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed 
                by a stove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, 
                and guarded by a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with 
                Fantine, and shut the door behind him, to the great disappointment 
                of the curious, who raised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their 
                necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house, in their 
                effort to see. Curiosity is a sort of gluttony.</p>
              <p> 　　To see is to devour.</p>
              <p> 　　On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and 
                mute, crouching down like a terrified dog.</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the 
                table. Javert seated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from 
                his pocket, and began to write.</p>
              <p> 　　This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the 
                discretion of the police.</p>
              <p> 　　The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good 
                to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which 
                they entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; 
                his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he 
                was seriously and deeply preoccupied.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those moments when he was exercising without 
                control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, 
                his redoubtable discretionary power.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment he was conscious that his police agent's stool 
                was a tribunal.</p>
              <p> 　　He was entering judgment. He judged and condemned.</p>
              <p> 　　He summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his 
                mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The more he examined 
                the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was evident 
                that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just 
                beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder 
                and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside 
                all pales.</p>
              <p> 　　A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen.</p>
              <p> 　　He had seen that, he, Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　He wrote in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said 
                to the sergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, &quot;Take 
                three men and conduct this creature to jail.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then, turning to Fantine, &quot;You are to have six months 
                of it.&quot; The unhappy woman shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Six months! six months of prison!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Six months in which to earn seven sous a day!</p>
              <p> 　　But what will become of Cosette? My daughter! my daughter!</p>
              <p> 　　But I still owe the Thenardiers over a hundred francs; do 
                you know that, Monsieur Inspector?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy 
                boots of all those men, without rising, with clasped hands, and 
                taking great strides on her knees.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Javert,&quot; said she, &quot;I beseech your 
                mercy.</p>
              <p> 　　I assure you that I was not in the wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen.</p>
              <p> 　　I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame!</p>
              <p> 　　That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow 
                in my back.</p>
              <p> 　　Has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are 
                walking along peaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather 
                ill, as you see.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for 
                a long time:</p>
              <p> 　　`You are ugly! you have no teeth!' I know well that I have 
                no longer those teeth.</p>
              <p> 　　I did nothing; I said to myself, `The gentleman is amusing 
                himself.'</p>
              <p> 　　I was honest with him; I did not speak to him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back.</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur Inspector! is there not some 
                person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true?</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that one is not 
                master of one's self at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; 
                and then, when some one puts something cold down your back just 
                when you are not expecting it!</p>
              <p> 　　I did wrong to spoil that gentleman's hat.</p>
              <p> 　　Why did he go away?</p>
              <p> 　　I would ask his pardon.</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, my God!</p>
              <p> 　　It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon.</p>
              <p> 　　Do me the favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! 
                you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a 
                day; it is not the government's fault, but seven sous is one's 
                earnings; and just fancy, I must pay one hundred francs, or my 
                little girl will be sent to me.</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, my God!</p>
              <p> 　　I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, my Cosette!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of 
                her, poor creature?</p>
              <p> 　　I will tell you: it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; 
                and such people are unreasonable.</p>
              <p> 　　They want money.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't put me in prison! You see, there is a little girl who 
                will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may, 
                in the very heart of the winter; and you must have pity on such 
                a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If she were older, she might 
                earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age.</p>
              <p> 　　I am not a bad woman at bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what 
                I am.</p>
              <p> 　　If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not love it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, 
                it was only necessary to glance into my closets, and it would 
                have been evident that I was not a coquettish and untidy woman.</p>
              <p> 　　I had linen, a great deal of linen.</p>
              <p> 　　Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with 
                tears, her neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a 
                dry, short cough, stammering softly with a voice of agony.</p>
              <p> 　　Great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray, which transfigures 
                the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once 
                more.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time she paused, and tenderly kissed the police 
                agent's coat. She would have softened a heart of granite; but 
                a heart of wood cannot be softened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come!&quot; said Javert, &quot;I have heard you out.</p>
              <p> 　　Have you entirely finished? You will get six months.</p>
              <p> 　　Now march!</p>
              <p> 　　The Eternal Father in person could do nothing more.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At these solemn words, &quot;the Eternal Father in person 
                could do nothing more,&quot; she understood that her fate was 
                sealed. She sank down, murmuring, &quot;Mercy!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert turned his back.</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers seized her by the arms.</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid 
                any heed to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened 
                to Fantine's despairing supplications.</p>
              <p> 　　At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the 
                unfortunate woman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, 
                and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One moment, if you please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　He removed his hat, and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved 
                awkwardness:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The words &quot;Mr. Mayor&quot; produced a curious effect 
                upon Fantine. She rose to her feet with one bound, like a spectre 
                springing from the earth, thrust aside the soldiers with both 
                arms, walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one could 
                prevent her, and gazing intently at him, with a bewildered air, 
                she cried:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad.</p>
              <p> 　　He experienced at that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, 
                the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his 
                life. To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor's face was 
                a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, 
                he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. 
                On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made 
                a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what 
                this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse 
                of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. 
                But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his 
                face and say, &quot;Set this woman at liberty,&quot; he underwent 
                a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him 
                equally; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded 
                in his case. He remained mute.</p>
              <p> 　　The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. 
                She raised her bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, 
                like a person who is reeling.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in 
                a low voice, as though talking to herself:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;At liberty!</p>
              <p> 　　I am to be allowed to go!</p>
              <p> 　　I am not to go to prison for six months!</p>
              <p> 　　Who said that?</p>
              <p> 　　It is not possible that any one could have said that.</p>
              <p> 　　I did not hear aright.</p>
              <p> 　　It cannot have been that monster of a mayor!</p>
              <p> 　　Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to 
                be set free?</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, see here!</p>
              <p> 　　I will tell you about it, and you will let me go.</p>
              <p> 　　That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is 
                the cause of all.</p>
              <p> 　　Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because 
                of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom.</p>
              <p> 　　If that is not a horror, what is?</p>
              <p> 　　To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then 
                I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery followed. In 
                the first place, there is one improvement which these gentlemen 
                of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison contractors 
                from wronging poor people.</p>
              <p> 　　I will explain it to you, you see:</p>
              <p> 　　you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls 
                to nine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to 
                become whatever one can.</p>
              <p> 　　As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actually forced 
                to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that 
                blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief.</p>
              <p> 　　After that I stamped on that gentleman's hat in front of the 
                officers' cafe; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow.</p>
              <p> 　　We women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see 
                that I did not do wrong deliberately--truly, Monsieur Javert; 
                and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, 
                and who are much happier.</p>
              <p> 　　O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave orders that I am to 
                be set free, was it not?</p>
              <p> 　　Make inquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent 
                now; they will tell you that I am perfectly honest.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! my God!</p>
              <p> 　　I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally touched the damper 
                of the stove, and it has made it smoke.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention.</p>
              <p> 　　While she was speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew 
                out his purse and opened it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was empty.</p>
              <p> 　　He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, &quot;How 
                much did you say that you owed?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Was I speaking to you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then, addressing the soldiers:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? 
                Ah! you old wretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but 
                I'm not afraid of you.</p>
              <p> 　　I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur 
                Javert!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　So saying, she turned to the inspector again:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to 
                be just. I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, 
                it is perfectly simple:</p>
              <p> 　　a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman's back, 
                and that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves 
                in some way; and we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves 
                with, of course!</p>
              <p> 　　And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve 
                order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, 
                since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; 
                it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison 
                would prevent my supporting my child. `Only, don't do it again, 
                you hussy!'</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　I won't do it again, Monsieur Javert!</p>
              <p> 　　They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not 
                expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I told 
                you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball 
                in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, `Take care of yourself.'</p>
              <p> 　　Here, feel, give me your hand; don't be afraid-- it is here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert's 
                coarse hand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly 
                at him.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, 
                dropped the folds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she 
                dragged herself along, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped 
                towards the door, saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with 
                a friendly nod:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Children, Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to 
                be released, and I am going.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She laid her hand on the latch of the door.</p>
              <p> 　　One step more and she would be in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with 
                his eyes fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some 
                displaced statue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.</p>
              <p> 　　The sound of the latch roused him.</p>
              <p> 　　He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority, 
                an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority 
                rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in 
                the man of no estate.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sergeant!&quot; he cried, &quot;don't you see that that 
                jade is walking off! Who bade you let her go?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I,&quot; said Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, and let go 
                of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has 
                stolen. At the sound of Madeleine's voice she turned around, and 
                from that moment forth she uttered no word, nor dared so much 
                as to breathe freely, but her glance strayed from Madeleine to 
                Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn, according to which 
                was speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond 
                measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant 
                as he had done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should 
                be set at liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?</p>
              <p> 　　Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible 
                that any &quot;authority&quot; should have given such an order, 
                and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake 
                for another, without intending it?</p>
              <p> 　　Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness 
                for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary 
                to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that 
                the small should be made great, that the police spy should transform 
                himself into a magistrate, that the policeman should become a 
                dispenser of justice, and that, in this prodigious extremity, 
                order, law, morality, government, society in its entirety, was 
                personified in him, Javert?</p>
              <p> 　　However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, 
                _I_, as we have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to 
                turn toward the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look 
                of despair, his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver 
                and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with downcast 
                eyes but a firm voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not?&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inspector Javert,&quot; replied the mayor, in a calm 
                and conciliating tone, &quot;listen.</p>
              <p> 　　You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining 
                matters to you.</p>
              <p> 　　Here is the true state of the case: I was passing through 
                the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were 
                still groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and 
                learned everything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and 
                who should have been arrested by properly conducted police.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert retorted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That concerns me,&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My own insult belongs to me, I think.</p>
              <p> 　　I can do what I please about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I beg Monsieur le Maire's pardon.</p>
              <p> 　　The insult is not to him but to the law.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inspector Javert,&quot; replied M. Madeleine, &quot;the 
                highest law is conscience.</p>
              <p> 　　I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then content yourself with obeying.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am obeying my duty.</p>
              <p> 　　My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in 
                prison.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine replied gently:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching 
                look on the mayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was 
                still profoundly respectful:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the 
                first time in my life, but he will permit me to remark that I 
                am within the bounds of my authority.</p>
              <p> 　　I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the 
                question of the gentleman.</p>
              <p> 　　I was present. This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabnois, 
                who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with 
                a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade, three stories 
                high and entirely of cut stone.</p>
              <p> 　　Such things as there are in the world! In any case, Monsieur 
                le Maire, this is a question of police regulations in the streets, 
                and concerns me, and I shall detain this woman Fantine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice 
                which no one in the town had heard hitherto:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The matter to which you refer is one connected with 
                the municipal police.</p>
              <p> 　　According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, 
                and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge.</p>
              <p> 　　I order that this woman shall be set at liberty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert ventured to make a final effort.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Mr. Mayor--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 
                13th of December, 1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Maire, permit me--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Not another word.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave the room,&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, 
                like a Russian soldier.</p>
              <p> 　　He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement 
                as he passed.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion.</p>
              <p> 　　She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two 
                opposing powers. She had seen two men who held in their hands 
                her liberty, her life, her soul, her child, in combat before her 
                very eyes; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness, 
                the other was leading her back towards the light.</p>
              <p> 　　In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, 
                these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke 
                like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered 
                the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder from 
                head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was 
                the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long 
                regarded as the author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at 
                the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, 
                he had saved her!</p>
              <p> 　　Had she, then, been mistaken? Must she change her whole soul?</p>
              <p> 　　She did not know; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment, 
                she looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine 
                she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within 
                her, and something warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was 
                both joy, confidence and love, dawn in her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to 
                her and said to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man 
                who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have heard you.</p>
              <p> 　　I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe that 
                it is true, and I feel that it is true.</p>
              <p> 　　I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop.</p>
              <p> 　　Why did you not apply to me?</p>
              <p> 　　But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, 
                or you shall go to her.</p>
              <p> 　　You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please.</p>
              <p> 　　I undertake the care of your child and yourself.</p>
              <p> 　　You shall not work any longer if you do not like.</p>
              <p> 　　I will give all the money you require.</p>
              <p> 　　You shall be honest and happy once more.</p>
              <p> 　　And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,--and 
                I do not doubt it,-- you have never ceased to be virtuous and 
                holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This was more than Fantine could bear.</p>
              <p> 　　To have Cosette!</p>
              <p> 　　To leave this life of infamy.</p>
              <p> 　　To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to see 
                all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst 
                of her misery.</p>
              <p> 　　She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and 
                could only give vent to two or three sobs, &quot;Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, 
                and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and 
                press her lips to it.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she fainted. </p>

              <p> 　　THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY </p>
              <p> 　　An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages 
                which the reader is about to peruse, and of others which will 
                be met with further on.</p>
              <p> 　　The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning 
                himself, has been absent from Paris for many years.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris has been transformed since he quitted it.</p>
              <p> 　　A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, unknown 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris 
                is his mind's natal city.</p>
              <p> 　　In consequence of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris 
                of his youth, that Paris which he bore away religiously in his 
                memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must be permitted to 
                speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is possible 
                that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, 
                &quot;In such a street there stands such and such a house,&quot; 
                neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality. 
                Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. 
                For his own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he 
                writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which 
                is precious to him.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind 
                him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, 
                and that all has not vanished.</p>
              <p> 　　So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine 
                that those streets are a matter of indifference to you; that those 
                windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that 
                those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merely 
                the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you 
                do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you 
                tread are merely stones.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive that 
                the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those 
                doors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees 
                are well beloved by you; that you entered those houses which you 
                never entered, every day, and that you have left a part of your 
                heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.</p>
              <p> 　　All those places which you no longer behold, which you may 
                never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, 
                take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy 
                of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, 
                so to speak, the very form of France, and you love them; and you 
                call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, 
                and you will submit to no change: for you are attached to the 
                figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother.</p>
              <p> 　　May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? 
                That said, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into 
                the streets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise, 
                returning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not 
                being followed.</p>
              <p> 　　This manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag.</p>
              <p> 　　On soil where an imprint of the track may be left, this manoeuvre 
                possesses, among other advantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen 
                and the dogs, by throwing them on the wrong scent.</p>
              <p> 　　In venery this is called false re-imbushment.</p>
              <p> 　　The moon was full that night.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. The moon, still very 
                close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and shadow in 
                the streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean could glide along close to the houses on the 
                dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did not, perhaps, 
                take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side 
                escaped him.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue Poliveau, 
                he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette walked on without asking any questions.</p>
              <p> 　　The sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled 
                something passive into her nature.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover,--and this is a remark to which we shall frequently 
                have occasion to recur,--she had grown used, without being herself 
                aware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the 
                freaks of destiny.</p>
              <p> 　　And then she was with him, and she felt safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. 
                He trusted in God, as she trusted in him.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some 
                one greater than himself; he thought he felt a being leading him, 
                though invisible. However, he had no settled idea, no plan, no 
                project.</p>
              <p> 　　He was not even absolutely sure that it was Javert, and then 
                it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that he was 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Was not he disguised?</p>
              <p> 　　Was not he believed to be dead?</p>
              <p> 　　Still, queer things had been going on for several days.</p>
              <p> 　　He wanted no more of them. He was determined not to return 
                to the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking 
                a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he 
                might dwell.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard 
                quarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of 
                the Middle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined 
                in various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and 
                the Rue Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du 
                Puits l'Ermite. There are lodging houses in this locality, but 
                he did not even enter one, finding nothing which suited him. He 
                had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track, 
                they would have lost it.</p>
              <p> 　　As eleven o'clock struck from Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, he was 
                traversing the Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the 
                commissary of police, situated at No. 14.</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments later, the instinct of which we have spoken 
                above made him turn round. At that moment he saw distinctly, thanks 
                to the commissary's lantern, which betrayed them, three men who 
                were following him closely, pass, one after the other, under that 
                lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three entered 
                the alley leading to the commissary's house. The one who marched 
                at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, child,&quot; he said to Cosette; and he made haste 
                to quit the Rue Pontoise.</p>
              <p> 　　He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, 
                which was closed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue 
                de l'Epee-de-Bois and the Rue de l'Arbalete, and plunged into 
                the Rue des Postes.</p>
              <p> 　　At that time there was a square formed by the intersection 
                of streets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where 
                the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve turns off.</p>
              <p> 　　It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve 
                is an old street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through 
                the Rue des Postes once in ten years.</p>
              <p> 　　In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes was inhabited 
                by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.</p>
              <p> 　　The moon cast a livid light into this open space.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean went into ambush in a doorway, calculating that 
                if the men were still following him, he could not fail to get 
                a good look at them, as they traversed this illuminated space.</p>
              <p> 　　In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men 
                made their appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　There were four of them now.</p>
              <p> 　　All were tall, dressed in long, brown coats, with round hats, 
                and huge cudgels in their hands.</p>
              <p> 　　Their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no 
                less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness. 
                One would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, 
                like men in consultation.</p>
              <p> 　　They had an air of indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　The one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed 
                hastily with his right hand in the direction which Jean Valjean 
                had taken; another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with 
                considerable obstinacy. At the moment when the first man wheeled 
                round, the moon fell full in his face.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean recognized Javert perfectly.</p>

              <p> 　　WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE'S INTELLIGENCE</p>
              <p> 　　 On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man 
                had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of 
                the Boulevard de l'Hopital in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, 
                and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses 
                on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired 
                a chamber in that isolated quarter.</p>
              <p> 　　This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the 
                type of what may be called the well-bred mendicant,--extreme wretchedness 
                combined with extreme cleanliness.</p>
              <p> 　　This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts 
                with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very 
                poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very old and 
                very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare, 
                of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric 
                at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; 
                black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted; 
                and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced 
                a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration.</p>
              <p> 　　He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age, 
                from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, 
                and his countenance, where everything breathed depression and 
                weariness of life.</p>
              <p> 　　Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor which 
                stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty.</p>
              <p> 　　The wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have 
                disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively.</p>
              <p> 　　His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe, 
                and which was humble.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy 
                serenity. In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up 
                in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, 
                cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, and 
                had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made 
                of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from 
                red wax:</p>
              <p> 　　it was a cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.</p>
              <p> 　　There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly 
                in the winter.</p>
              <p> 　　The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but 
                this without any affectation.</p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch, King Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi: it was one of his 
                favorite excursions.</p>
              <p> 　　Towards two o'clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage 
                and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard 
                de l'Hopital.</p>
              <p> 　　This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women 
                of the quarter who said, &quot;It is two o'clock; there he is 
                returning to the Tuileries.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a 
                passing king always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance 
                and disappearance of Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was 
                rapid but majestic.</p>
              <p> 　　This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop; as he was 
                not able to walk, he wished to run:</p>
              <p> 　　that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　He passed, pacific and severe, in the midst of naked swords.</p>
              <p> 　　His massive couch, all covered with gilding, with great branches 
                of lilies painted on the panels, thundered noisily along.</p>
              <p> 　　There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted 
                cushions of white satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow 
                freshly powdered a l'oiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, 
                the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion 
                fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the 
                cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver 
                plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: 
                it was the king.</p>
              <p> 　　Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich 
                plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he 
                re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he 
                stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind. When 
                he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter, the 
                whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of 
                an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, &quot;That big fellow 
                yonder is the government.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, 
                therefore, the daily event of the Boulevard de l'Hopital.</p>
              <p> 　　The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong 
                in the quarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was 
                ignorant as to this detail.</p>
              <p> 　　When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a 
                squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched 
                on the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpetriere, 
                he appeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but 
                himself in this cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner 
                of the wall of an enclosure, though this did not prevent M. le 
                Duc de Havre from spying him out.</p>
              <p> 　　M. le Duc de Havre, as captain of the guard on duty that day, 
                was seated in the carriage, opposite the king.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to his Majesty, &quot;Yonder is an evil-looking man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Members of the police, who were clearing the king's route, 
                took equal note of him: one of them received an order to follow 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the 
                faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost 
                trace of him, as is stated in a report addressed that same evening 
                to M. le Comte d'Angles, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.</p>
              <p> 　　When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his 
                track, he redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a 
                time to assure himself that he was not being followed.</p>
              <p> 　　At a quarter-past four, that is to say, when night was fully 
                come, he passed in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin, 
                where The Two Convicts was being played that day.</p>
              <p> 　　This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; 
                for, although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An 
                instant later he was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and 
                he entered the Plat d'Etain [the Pewter Platter], where the office 
                of the coach for Lagny was then situated.</p>
              <p> 　　This coach set out at half-past four.</p>
              <p> 　　The horses were harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by 
                the coachman, were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the 
                vehicle.</p>
              <p> 　　The man inquired:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you a place?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Only one--beside me on the box,&quot; said the coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will take it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Climb up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance 
                at the traveller's shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his 
                bundle, and made him pay his fare.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you going as far as Lagny?&quot; demanded the coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　The traveller paid to Lagny.</p>
              <p> 　　They started.</p>
              <p> 　　When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried to enter 
                into conversation, but the traveller only replied in monosyllables.</p>
              <p> 　　The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses.</p>
              <p> 　　The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak.</p>
              <p> 　　It was cold. The man did not appear to be thinking of that.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus they passed Gournay and Neuilly-sur-Marne.</p>
              <p> 　　Towards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles.</p>
              <p> 　　The coachman drew up in front of the carters' inn installed 
                in the ancient buildings of the Royal Abbey, to give his horses 
                a breathing spell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I get down here,&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the 
                vehicle.</p>
              <p> 　　An instant later he had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not enter the inn.</p>
              <p> 　　When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did 
                not encounter him in the principal street of Chelles.</p>
              <p> 　　The coachman turned to the inside travellers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There,&quot; said he, &quot;is a man who does not belong 
                here, for I do not know him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider 
                money; he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It 
                is night; all the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, 
                and he is not to be found.</p>
              <p> 　　So he has dived through the earth.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with 
                great strides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, 
                then he had turned to the right before reaching the church, into 
                the cross-road leading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted 
                with the country and had been there before.</p>
              <p> 　　He followed this road rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　At the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree-bordered 
                road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard people coming.</p>
              <p> 　　He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there waited 
                until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was nearly 
                superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a very 
                dark December night.</p>
              <p> 　　Not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins.</p>
              <p> 　　The man did not return to the road to Montfermeil; he struck 
                across the fields to the right, and entered the forest with long 
                strides.</p>
              <p> 　　Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful 
                examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though 
                seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone. 
                There came a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused 
                in indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, 
                at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. 
                He stepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentively 
                through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in 
                review. A large tree, covered with those excrescences which are 
                the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile 
                of stones. He went up to this tree and passed his hand over the 
                bark of the trunk, as though seeking to recognize and count all 
                the warts.</p>
              <p> 　　Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree, 
                suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc 
                had been nailed by way of dressing.</p>
              <p> 　　He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the 
                space between the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who 
                is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been 
                disturbed.</p>
              <p> 　　That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through 
                the forest.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the man who had just met Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, 
                he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing 
                a burden on the ground, then taking it up and setting out again. 
                He drew near, and perceived that it was a very young child, laden 
                with an enormous bucket of water.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle 
                of the bucket.</p>

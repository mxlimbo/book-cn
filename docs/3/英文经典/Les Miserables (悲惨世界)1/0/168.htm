              <p> 　　RULE:</p>
              <p> 　　RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING</p>
              <p> 　　 Such was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his 
                hair,-- which was gray rather than white,--and which was always 
                dressed in &quot;dog's ears.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.</p>
              <p> 　　He had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous 
                and great.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. 
                Gillenormand, who was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived 
                in the Faubourg Saint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. 
                He had only retired to the Marais when he quitted society, long 
                after attaining the age of eighty.</p>
              <p> 　　And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his 
                habits. The principal one, and that which was invariable, was 
                to keep his door absolutely closed during the day, and never to 
                receive any one whatever except in the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　He dined at five o'clock, and after that his door was open.</p>
              <p> 　　That had been the fashion of his century, and he would not 
                swerve from it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The day is vulgar,&quot; said he, &quot;and deserves 
                only a closed shutter.</p>
              <p> 　　Fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith 
                lights up its stars.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he barricaded himself against every one, even had it been 
                the king himself. This was the antiquated elegance of his day.</p>

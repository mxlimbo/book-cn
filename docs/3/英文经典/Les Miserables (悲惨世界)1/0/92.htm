              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had been recaptured.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over 
                the sad details.</p>
              <p> 　　We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published 
                by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprising 
                events which had taken place at M. sur M.</p>
              <p> 　　These articles are rather summary.</p>
              <p> 　　It must be remembered, that at that epoch the Gazette des 
                Tribunaux was not yet in existence.</p>
              <p> 　　We borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc.</p>
              <p> 　　It bears the date of July 25, 1823.</p>
              <p> 　　An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre 
                of an event quite out of the ordinary course.</p>
              <p> 　　A man, who was a stranger in the Department, and who bore 
                the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the new methods, resuscitated 
                some years ago an ancient local industry, the manufacture of jet 
                and of black glass trinkets.</p>
              <p> 　　He had made his fortune in the business, and that of the arrondissement 
                as well, we will admit.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services.</p>
              <p> 　　The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than 
                an ex-convict who had broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, 
                and named Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison.</p>
              <p> 　　It appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in 
                withdrawing from the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half 
                a million which he had lodged there, and which he had, moreover, 
                and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business.</p>
              <p> 　　No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed 
                this money since his return to prison at Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　The second article, which enters a little more into detail, 
                is an extract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date. A former 
                convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just 
                appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances 
                calculated to attract attention.</p>
              <p> 　　This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the 
                police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded in getting 
                himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns; in 
                this town he had established a considerable commerce.</p>
              <p> 　　He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable 
                zeal of the public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman 
                of the town, who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest.</p>
              <p> 　　This scoundrel, who is endowed with Herculean strength, found 
                means to escape; but three or four days after his flight the police 
                laid their hands on him once more, in Paris itself, at the very 
                moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which 
                run between the capital and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). 
                He is said to have profited by this interval of three or four 
                days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him 
                with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been estimated at 
                six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is to 
                be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone, 
                and it has not been possible to lay hands on it.</p>
              <p> 　　However that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just been brought 
                before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused of 
                highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, 
                on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch 
                of Ferney has said, in immortal verse, </p>
              <p> 　　&quot;. . . Arrive from Savoy every year, </p>
              <p> 　　And who, with gentle hands, do clear </p>
              <p> 　　Those long canals choked up with soot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This bandit refused to defend himself.</p>
              <p> 　　It was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of 
                the public prosecutor, that the theft was committed in complicity 
                with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member of a band of robbers 
                in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned 
                to the death penalty in consequence.</p>
              <p> 　　This criminal refused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his 
                inexhaustible clemency, has deigned to commute his penalty to 
                that of penal servitude for life.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious 
                habits at M. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, 
                presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys.</p>
              <p> 　　He was called 9,430.</p>
              <p> 　　However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may 
                not be obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur 
                M. vanished with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during 
                his night of fever and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there 
                actually was a soul lacking.</p>
              <p> 　　After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical 
                division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment 
                of flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, 
                in the human community, and which history has noted only once, 
                because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants 
                are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out 
                of themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　Envious rivalries arose.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine's vast workshops were shut; his buildings fell 
                to ruin, his workmen were scattered.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, instead 
                of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the general good. There 
                was no longer a centre; everywhere there was competition and animosity.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all. No sooner 
                had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit 
                of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness 
                to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of the 
                founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were 
                tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products 
                were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for 
                lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, 
                bankruptcy arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.</p>
              <p> 　　The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed 
                somewhere. Less than four years after the judgment of the Court 
                of Assizes establishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, 
                for the benefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had 
                doubled in the arrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villele 
                called attention to the fact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 
                1827.</p>

              <p> 　　GAYETIES</p>
              <p> 　　 None the less, these young girls filled this grave house 
                with charming souvenirs.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister.</p>
              <p> 　　The recreation hour struck.</p>
              <p> 　　A door swung on its hinges.</p>
              <p> 　　The birds said, &quot;Good; here come the children!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with 
                a cross like a shroud.</p>
              <p> 　　Radiant faces, white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry 
                light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered about amid these shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells and 
                offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden 
                more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened, 
                and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each 
                other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little 
                white teeth chattered in the corners; <br>
                the veils superintended the laughs from a distance, shades kept 
                watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it?</p>
              <p> 　　Still they beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls 
                had their moment of dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely 
                blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming 
                of the hives.</p>
              <p> 　　It was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of 
                mourning.</p>
              <p> 　　The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the 
                gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to these children, there was, among so many austere 
                hours, one hour of ingenuousness.</p>
              <p> 　　The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced.</p>
              <p> 　　In this cloister play was mingled with heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh, 
                expanding young souls.</p>
              <p> 　　Homer would have come thither to laugh with Perrault; and 
                there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, 
                pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their 
                ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, 
                those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from 
                Hecuba to la Mere-Grand.</p>
              <p> 　　In that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those 
                children's sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile 
                that is full of thoughtfulness.</p>
              <p> 　　It was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five 
                years exclaimed one day: &quot;Mother! one of the big girls has 
                just told me that I have only nine years and ten months longer 
                to remain here.</p>
              <p> 　　What happiness!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:--</p>
              <p> 　　A Vocal Mother.</p>
              <p> 　　Why are you weeping, my child?</p>
              <p> 　　The child (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. 
                She says that I do not know it, but I do.</p>
              <p> 　　Alix, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.</p>
              <p> 　　The Mother.</p>
              <p> 　　How is that, my child?</p>
              <p> 　　Alix.</p>
              <p> 　　She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any 
                question in the book, and she would answer it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She did not answer it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us see about it.</p>
              <p> 　　What did you ask her?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I 
                put the first question that I came across.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what was the question?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was, `What happened after that?'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather 
                greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread 
                and butter just like a person!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there 
                was once picked up a confession which had been written out in 
                advance, in order that she might not forget it, by a sinner of 
                seven years:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to 
                the gentlemen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy 
                mouth six years of age improvised the following tale, which was 
                listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There were three little cocks who owned a country where 
                there were a great many flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　They plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets.</p>
              <p> 　　After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of 
                forest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little 
                cocks.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And this other poem:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There came a blow with a stick.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was not good for her; it hurt her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then a lady put Punchinello in prison.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom 
                the convent was bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet 
                and heart-breaking saying.</p>
              <p> 　　She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmured 
                in her corner:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying 
                through the corridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was 
                Sister Agatha.</p>
              <p> 　　The big big girls--those over ten years of age-- called her 
                Agathocles.</p>
              <p> 　　The refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, 
                which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a 
                level with the garden, was dark and damp, and, as the children 
                say, full of beasts. All the places round about furnished their 
                contingent of insects.</p>
              <p> 　　Each of its four corners had received, in the language of 
                the pupils, a special and expressive name.</p>
              <p> 　　There was Spider corner, Caterpillar corner, Wood-louse corner, 
                and Cricket corner.</p>
              <p> 　　Cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. 
                It was not so cold there as elsewhere.</p>
              <p> 　　From the refectory the names had passed to the boarding-school, 
                and there served as in the old College Mazarin to distinguish 
                four nations.</p>
              <p> 　　Every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according 
                to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals.</p>
              <p> 　　One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral 
                visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair 
                enter the class-room through which he was passing.</p>
              <p> 　　He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy 
                cheeks, who stood near him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is a spider, Monseigneur.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!</p>
              <p> 　　And that one yonder?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is a cricket.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And that one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is a caterpillar.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really! and yourself?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities.</p>
              <p> 　　At the beginning of this century Ecouen was one of those strict 
                and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in 
                a shadow that is almost august. At Ecouen, in order to take rank 
                in the procession of the Holy Sacrament, a distinction was made 
                between virgins and florists. There were also the &quot;dais&quot; 
                and the &quot;censors,&quot;--the first who held the cords of 
                the dais, and the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament.</p>
              <p> 　　The flowers belonged by right to the florists. Four &quot;virgins&quot; 
                walked in advance.</p>
              <p> 　　On the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear 
                the question put in the dormitory, &quot;Who is a virgin?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Campan used to quote this saying of a &quot;little 
                one&quot; of seven years, to a &quot;big girl&quot; of sixteen, 
                who took the head of the procession, while she, the little one, 
                remained at the rear, &quot;You are a virgin, but I am not.&quot;</p>

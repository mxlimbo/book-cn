              <p> 　　ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION</p>
              <p> 　　However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought 
                to convey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced 
                with the same severity in other convents.</p>
              <p> 　　At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which 
                belonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutters were 
                replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a salon 
                with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white 
                muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, 
                a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, 
                and even the head of a Turk.</p>
              <p> 　　It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that 
                famous chestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the 
                largest in France, and which bore the reputation among the good 
                people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the 
                chestnut trees of the realm.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by 
                Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different 
                from those who depended on Citeaux.</p>
              <p> 　　This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very ancient 
                and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the 
                holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, 
                in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en 
                Greve, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town 
                in an uproar.</p>
              <p> 　　M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered 
                a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope's Nuncio 
                officiated.</p>
              <p> 　　But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame 
                Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Chateauvieux.</p>
              <p> 　　This outrage committed on &quot;the most holy sacrament of 
                the altar,&quot; though but temporary, would not depart from these 
                holy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated 
                by a &quot;Perpetual Adoration&quot; in some female monastery. 
                Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, made donations of 
                notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy Sacrament, 
                a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious 
                end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission 
                for this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. 
                de Metz, Abbe of Saint-Germain, &quot;on condition that no woman 
                could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres 
                income, which amounts to six thousand livres, to the principal.&quot; 
                After the Abbe of Saint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; 
                and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters, was confirmed 
                in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment 
                of the Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament 
                at Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Their first convent was &quot;a new building&quot; in the 
                Rue Cassette, out of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and 
                de Chateauvieux.</p>
              <p> 　　This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with 
                the Benedictine nuns of Citeaux.</p>
              <p> 　　It mounted back to the Abbe of Saint-Germain des Pres, in 
                the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred Heart go back to 
                the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity to the 
                general of the Lazarists.</p>
              <p> 　　It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the 
                Petit-Picpus, whose interior we have just shown.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had authorized, by a special 
                brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus, to practise the 
                Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the Holy Sacrament.</p>
              <p> 　　But the two orders remained distinct none the less.</p>

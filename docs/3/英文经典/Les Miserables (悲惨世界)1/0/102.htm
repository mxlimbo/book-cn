              <p> 　　THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE'S HOUSE A POOR MAN 
                WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN</p>
              <p> 　　 Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance 
                at the big doll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant's; 
                then she knocked. The door opened.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand.</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;Ah! so it's you, you little wretch! good mercy, but 
                you've taken your time!</p>
              <p> 　　The hussy has been amusing herself!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame,&quot; said Cosette, trembling all over, &quot;here's 
                a gentleman who wants a lodging.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable 
                grimace, a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly 
                sought the new-comer with her eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is the gentleman?&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Madame,&quot; replied the man, raising his hand 
                to his hat.</p>
              <p> 　　Wealthy travellers are not so polite.</p>
              <p> 　　This gesture, and an inspection of the stranger's costume 
                and baggage, which the Thenardier passed in review with one glance, 
                caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the gruff mien to reappear.</p>
              <p> 　　She resumed dryly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Enter, my good man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The &quot;good man&quot; entered.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier cast a second glance at him, paid particular 
                attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare, 
                and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her 
                head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted 
                her husband, who was still drinking with the carters. The husband 
                replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, 
                backed up by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: 
                A regular beggar.</p>
              <p> 　　Thereupon, the Thenardier exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have 
                no room left.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Put me where you like,&quot; said the man; &quot;in 
                the attic, in the stable. I will pay as though I occupied a room.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forty sous.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forty sous; agreed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Very well, then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forty sous!&quot; said a carter, in a low tone, to the 
                Thenardier woman; &quot;why, the charge is only twenty sous!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is forty in his case,&quot; retorted the Thenardier, 
                in the same tone. &quot;I don't lodge poor folks for less.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's true,&quot; added her husband, gently; &quot;it 
                ruins a house to have such people in it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel 
                on a bench, had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made 
                haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass.</p>
              <p> 　　The merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it 
                to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the kitchen 
                table, and her knitting.</p>
              <p> 　　The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which 
                he had poured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar 
                attention.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was ugly.</p>
              <p> 　　If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We have 
                already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was 
                thin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed 
                to be hardly six.</p>
              <p> 　　Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put 
                out with weeping.</p>
              <p> 　　The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish 
                which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.</p>
              <p> 　　Her hands were, as her mother had divined, &quot;ruined with 
                chilblains.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into 
                relief all the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness 
                frightfully apparent.</p>
              <p> 　　As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of 
                pressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing 
                was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which 
                inspired horror in winter.</p>
              <p> 　　All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen.</p>
              <p> 　　Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and 
                blue spots could be descried, which marked the places where the 
                Thenardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and 
                red.</p>
              <p> 　　The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep.</p>
              <p> 　　This child's whole person, her mien, her attitude, the sound 
                of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to elapse between 
                one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her slightest 
                gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,--fear.</p>
              <p> 　　Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so 
                to speak; fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her 
                heels under her petticoat, made her occupy as little space as 
                possible, allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary, 
                and had become what might be called the habit of her body, admitting 
                of no possible variation except an increase.</p>
              <p> 　　In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where 
                terror lurked.</p>
              <p> 　　Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette 
                did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently 
                down to her work again.</p>
              <p> 　　The expression in the glance of that child of eight years 
                was habitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed 
                at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming 
                an idiot or a demon.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; 
                she had never set foot in a church.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have I the time?&quot; said the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, the Thenardier exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way, where's that bread?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thenardier uplifted 
                her voice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.</p>
              <p> 　　She had completely forgotten the bread.</p>
              <p> 　　She had recourse to the expedient of children who live in 
                a constant state of fear. She lied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame, the baker's shop was shut.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You should have knocked.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I did knock, Madame.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He did not open the door.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'll find out to-morrow whether that is true,&quot; 
                said the Thenardier; &quot;and if you are telling me a lie, I'll 
                lead you a pretty dance. In the meantime, give me back my fifteen-sou 
                piece.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and 
                turned green. The fifteen-sou piece was not there.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, come now,&quot; said Madame Thenardier, &quot;did 
                you hear me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in 
                it. What could have become of that money?</p>
              <p> 　　The unhappy little creature could not find a word to say.</p>
              <p> 　　She was petrified.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?&quot; screamed 
                the Thenardier, hoarsely, &quot;or do you want to rob me of it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the cat-o'-nine-tails 
                which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.</p>
              <p> 　　This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength 
                to shriek:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mercy, Madame, Madame!</p>
              <p> 　　I will not do so any more!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier took down the whip.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling 
                in the fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his 
                movements. Besides, the other travellers were drinking or playing 
                cards, and were not paying attention to anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within 
                the angle of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal 
                her poor half-nude limbs.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier raised her arm.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pardon me, Madame,&quot; said the man, &quot;but just 
                now I caught sight of something which had fallen from this little 
                one's apron pocket, and rolled aside.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps this is it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on 
                the floor for a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Exactly; here it is,&quot; he went on, straightening 
                himself up.</p>
              <p> 　　And he held out a silver coin to the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, that's it,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thenardier 
                found it to her advantage.</p>
              <p> 　　She put the coin in her pocket, and confined herself to casting 
                a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the remark, &quot;Don't 
                let this ever happen again!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette returned to what the Thenardier called &quot;her kennel,&quot; 
                and her large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began 
                to take on an expression such as they had never worn before. Thus 
                far it was only an innocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied 
                confidence was mingled with it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way, would you like some supper?&quot; the Thenardier 
                inquired of the traveller.</p>
              <p> 　　He made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　He appeared to be absorbed in thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What sort of a man is that?&quot; she muttered between 
                her teeth. &quot;He's some frightfully poor wretch.</p>
              <p> 　　He hasn't a sou to pay for a supper.</p>
              <p> 　　Will he even pay me for his lodging?</p>
              <p> 　　It's very lucky, all the same, that it did not occur to him 
                to steal the money that was on the floor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, a door had opened, and Eponine and Azelma 
                entered.</p>
              <p> 　　They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than 
                peasant in looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut 
                tresses, the other with long black braids hanging down her back, 
                both vivacious, neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight 
                to the eye.</p>
              <p> 　　They were warmly clad, but with so much maternal art that 
                the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry 
                of arrangement.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a hint of winter, though the springtime was not 
                wholly effaced.</p>
              <p> 　　Light emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, 
                they were on the throne.</p>
              <p> 　　In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they 
                made, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thenardier 
                said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, 
                &quot;Ah! there you are, you children!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing 
                their hair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them 
                with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, 
                she exclaimed, &quot;What frights they are!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They 
                had a doll, which they turned over and over on their knees with 
                all sorts of joyous chatter.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting, 
                and watched their play with a melancholy air.</p>
              <p> 　　Eponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　She was the same as a dog to them.</p>
              <p> 　　These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty 
                years between them, but they already represented the whole society 
                of man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The doll of the Thenardier sisters was very much faded, very 
                old, and much broken; but it seemed none the less admirable to 
                Cosette, who had never had a doll in her life, a real doll, to 
                make use of the expression which all children will understand.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, the Thenardier, who had been going back and forth 
                in the room, perceived that Cosette's mind was distracted, and 
                that, instead of working, she was paying attention to the little 
                ones at their play.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　I've caught you at it!&quot; she cried.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So that's the way you work! I'll make you work to the 
                tune of the whip; that I will.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger turned to the Thenardier, without quitting his 
                chair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah, Madame,&quot; he said, with an almost timid air, 
                &quot;let her play!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice 
                of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, 
                and who had not the air of being frightfully poor, would have 
                been equivalent to an order.</p>
              <p> 　　But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such 
                a desire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself 
                to have a will, was something which Madame Thenardier did not 
                intend to tolerate.</p>
              <p> 　　She retorted with acrimony:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She must work, since she eats.</p>
              <p> 　　I don't feed her to do nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is she making?&quot; went on the stranger, in a 
                gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments 
                and his porter's shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier deigned to reply:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stockings, if you please.</p>
              <p> 　　Stockings for my little girls, who have none, so to speak, 
                and who are absolutely barefoot just now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The man looked at Cosette's poor little red feet, and continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When will she have finished this pair of stockings?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She has at least three or four good days' work on them 
                still, the lazy creature!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when 
                she has finished them?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thirty sous at least.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you sell them for five francs?&quot; went on the 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good heavens!&quot; exclaimed a carter who was listening, 
                with a loud laugh; &quot;five francs! the deuce, I should think 
                so! five balls!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier thought it time to strike in.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed 
                to have that pair of stockings for five francs.</p>
              <p> 　　We can refuse nothing to travellers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You must pay on the spot,&quot; said the Thenardier, 
                in her curt and peremptory fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will buy that pair of stockings,&quot; replied the 
                man, &quot;and,&quot; he added, drawing a five-franc piece from 
                his pocket, and laying it on the table, &quot;I will pay for them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he turned to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now I own your work; play, my child.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that 
                he abandoned his glass and hastened up.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But it's true!&quot; he cried, examining it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A real hind wheel! and not counterfeit!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier had no reply to make.</p>
              <p> 　　She bit her lips, and her face assumed an expression of hatred.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, Cosette was trembling.</p>
              <p> 　　She ventured to ask:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it true, Madame?</p>
              <p> 　　May I play?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Play!&quot; said the Thenardier, in a terrible voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thanks, Madame,&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier, her whole little 
                soul thanked the traveller.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in 
                his ear:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who can this yellow man be?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have seen millionaires with coats like that,&quot; 
                replied Thenardier, in a sovereign manner.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. 
                Cosette always moved as little as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from 
                a box behind her.</p>
              <p> 　　Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. 
                They had just executed a very important operation; they had just 
                got hold of the cat.</p>
              <p> 　　They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Eponine, who 
                was the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing 
                and its contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue 
                scraps.</p>
              <p> 　　While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying 
                to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children, 
                whose grace, like the splendor of the butterfly's wing, vanishes 
                when one essays to fix it fast.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the 
                other. She twists, she cries, she is warm.</p>
              <p> 　　See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be my little 
                girl.</p>
              <p> 　　I will be a lady.</p>
              <p> 　　I will come to see you, and you shall look at her.</p>
              <p> 　　Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will surprise 
                you.</p>
              <p> 　　And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her 
                tail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, `Ah! Mon Dieu!' 
                and I will say to you: `Yes, Madame, it is my little girl.</p>
              <p> 　　Little girls are made like that just at present.'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene 
                song, and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier accompanied and encouraged them.</p>
              <p> 　　As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a 
                doll out of anything which comes to hand.</p>
              <p> 　　While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat, Cosette, 
                on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she laid it 
                in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same 
                time, one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. 
                To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, 
                to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, 
                to imagine that something is some one,--therein lies the whole 
                woman's future.</p>
              <p> 　　While dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby 
                clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages and bodices, 
                the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, 
                the big girl into a woman.</p>
              <p> 　　The first child is the continuation of the last doll.</p>
              <p> 　　A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite 
                as impossible, as a woman without children.</p>
              <p> 　　So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man; &quot;My husband 
                is right,&quot; she thought; &quot;perhaps it is M. Laffitte; 
                there are such queer rich men!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She came and set her elbows on the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; up to that time, the 
                Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see, sir,&quot; she pursued, assuming a sweetish 
                air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, 
                &quot;I am willing that the child should play; I do not oppose 
                it, but it is good for once, because you are generous.</p>
              <p> 　　You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then this child is not yours?&quot; demanded the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we 
                have taken in through charity; a sort of imbecile child.</p>
              <p> 　　She must have water on the brain; she has a large head, as 
                you see.</p>
              <p> 　　We do what we can for her, for we are not rich; we have written 
                in vain to her native place, and have received no reply these 
                six months. It must be that her mother is dead.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said the man, and fell into his revery once 
                more.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Her mother didn't amount to much,&quot; added the Thenardier; 
                &quot;she abandoned her child.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned 
                by some instinct that she was under discussion, had not taken 
                her eyes from the Thenardier's face; she listened vaguely; she 
                caught a few words here and there.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were 
                repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was 
                a highly spiced and wanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant 
                Jesus were introduced.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, 
                which was reflected from her fixed eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made, 
                and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, &quot;My mother 
                is dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, &quot;the 
                millionaire,&quot; consented at last to take supper.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does Monsieur wish?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bread and cheese,&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Decidedly, he is a beggar&quot; thought Madame Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child 
                under the table was singing hers.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and 
                caught sight of the little Thenardiers' doll, which they had abandoned 
                for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen 
                table.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her 
                needs, and cast her eyes slowly round the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting 
                over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playing with the cat; the 
                travellers were eating or drinking or singing; not a glance was 
                fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose; she crept out from 
                under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that 
                no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll 
                and seized it.</p>
              <p> 　　An instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, 
                and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held 
                in her arms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so rare 
                for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.</p>
              <p> 　　No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly 
                devouring his meagre supper.</p>
              <p> 　　This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.</p>
              <p> 　　But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did 
                not perceive that one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the 
                fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly.</p>
              <p> 　　That pink and shining foot, projecting from the shadow, suddenly 
                struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Eponine, &quot;Look! sister.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared 
                to take their doll!</p>
              <p> 　　Eponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her 
                mother, and began to tug at her skirt.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me alone!&quot; said her mother; &quot;what do you 
                want?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mother,&quot; said the child, &quot;look there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And she pointed to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer 
                saw or heard anything.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Thenardier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression 
                which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of 
                life, and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras.</p>
              <p> 　　On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still 
                further. Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid 
                violent hands on the doll belonging to &quot;these young ladies.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son's 
                blue ribbon would wear no other face.</p>
              <p> 　　She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cosette!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; 
                she turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Cosette!&quot; repeated the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with 
                a sort of veneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking 
                her eyes from it, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible 
                to relate of a child of that age, she wrung them; then--not one 
                of the emotions of the day, neither the trip to the forest, nor 
                the weight of the bucket of water, nor the loss of the money, 
                nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad words which she had 
                heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wring this from 
                her-- she wept; she burst out sobbing.</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he said to the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you see?&quot; said the Thenardier, pointing to 
                the corpus delicti which lay at Cosette's feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, what of it?&quot; resumed the man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That beggar,&quot; replied the Thenardier, &quot;has 
                permitted herself to touch the children's doll!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All this noise for that!&quot; said the man; &quot;well, 
                what if she did play with that doll?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She touched it with her dirty hands!&quot; pursued the 
                Thenardier, &quot;with her frightful hands!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Cosette redoubled her sobs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you stop your noise?&quot; screamed the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped 
                out.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as he had gone, the Thenardier profited by his absence 
                to give Cosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the 
                child utter loud cries.</p>
              <p> 　　The door opened again, the man re-appeared; he carried in 
                both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which 
                all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning, 
                and he set it upright in front of Cosette, saying:--</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                &quot;Here; this is for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more 
                which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through 
                his revery of that toy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles 
                so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through 
                the window of the drinking-shop.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching 
                her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard 
                the unprecedented words, &quot;It is for you&quot;; she stared 
                at him; she stared at the doll; then she slowly retreated, and 
                hid herself at the extreme end, under the table in a corner of 
                the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance 
                of no longer daring to breathe.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier, Eponine, and Azelma were like statues also; 
                the very drinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through 
                the whole room.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame Thenardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures: 
                &quot;Who is that old fellow?</p>
              <p> 　　Is he a poor man?</p>
              <p> 　　Is he a millionaire? Perhaps he is both; that is to say, a 
                thief.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive 
                fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant 
                instinct appears there in all its bestial force.</p>
              <p> 　　The tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the 
                traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as he would have 
                scented out a bag of money. This did not last longer than the 
                space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said 
                to her in a low voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That machine costs at least thirty francs.</p>
              <p> 　　No nonsense. Down on your belly before that man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gross natures have this in common with naive natures, that 
                they possess no transition state.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Cosette,&quot; said the Thenardier, in a voice 
                that strove to be sweet, and which was composed of the bitter 
                honey of malicious women, &quot;aren't you going to take your 
                doll?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,&quot; 
                said Thenardier, with a caressing air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take it; it is yours.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. 
                Her face was still flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, 
                like the sky at daybreak, with strange beams of joy.</p>
              <p> 　　What she felt at that moment was a little like what she would 
                have felt if she had been abruptly told, &quot;Little one, you 
                are the Queen of France.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning 
                would dart from it.</p>
              <p> 　　This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself 
                that the Thenardier would scold and beat her.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day.</p>
              <p> 　　She ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned 
                towards Madame Thenardier:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;May I, Madame?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, 
                and ecstatic.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pardi!&quot; cried the Thenardier, &quot;it is yours.</p>
              <p> 　　The gentleman has given it to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Truly, sir?&quot; said Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it true?</p>
              <p> 　　Is the `lady' mine?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears.</p>
              <p> 　　He appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a 
                man does not speak for fear lest he should weep.</p>
              <p> 　　He nodded to Cosette, and placed the &quot;lady's&quot; hand 
                in her tiny hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the &quot;lady&quot; 
                scorched her, and began to stare at the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　We are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her 
                tongue immoderately. All at once she wheeled round and seized 
                the doll in a transport.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I shall call her Catherine,&quot; she said.</p>
              <p> 　　It was an odd moment when Cosette's rags met and clasped the 
                ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame,&quot; she resumed, &quot;may I put her on a 
                chair?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, my child,&quot; replied the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　It was now the turn of Eponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette 
                with envy.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on 
                the floor in front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering 
                a word, in an attitude of contemplation.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Play, Cosette,&quot; said the stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　I am playing,&quot; returned the child.</p>
              <p> 　　This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of 
                a visit which Providence was making on Cosette, was the person 
                whom the Thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that 
                moment.</p>
              <p> 　　However, it was necessary to control herself. Habituated as 
                she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband 
                in all his actions, these emotions were more than she could endure.</p>
              <p> 　　She made haste to send her daughters to bed, then she asked 
                the man's permission to send Cosette off also; &quot;for she has 
                worked hard all day,&quot; she added with a maternal air. Cosette 
                went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time the Thenardier went to the other end of 
                the room where her husband was, to relieve her soul, as she said. 
                She exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious 
                because she dared not utter them aloud.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Old beast!</p>
              <p> 　　What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in this 
                manner!</p>
              <p> 　　To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-franc 
                dolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would!</p>
              <p> 　　A little more and he will be saying Your Majesty to her, as 
                though to the Duchess de Berry!</p>
              <p> 　　Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that mysterious 
                old fellow?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why! it is perfectly simple,&quot; replied Thenardier, 
                &quot;if that amuses him! It amuses you to have the little one 
                work; it amuses him to have her play.</p>
              <p> 　　He's all right.</p>
              <p> 　　A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it.</p>
              <p> 　　If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you?</p>
              <p> 　　If he is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you 
                worrying for, so long as he has money?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, 
                neither of which admitted of any reply.</p>
              <p> 　　The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his 
                thoughtful attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had withdrawn 
                a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him from 
                a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed 
                man, who drew &quot;hind-wheels&quot; from his pocket with so 
                much ease, and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats 
                in wooden shoes, was certainly a magnificent fellow, and one to 
                be feared.</p>
              <p> 　　Many hours passed.</p>
              <p> 　　The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased, the drinkers 
                had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed, the public 
                room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still remained 
                in the same place and the same attitude.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned.</p>
              <p> 　　That was all; but he had not said a word since Cosette had 
                left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had 
                remained in the room.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?&quot; 
                grumbled the Thenardier. When two o'clock in the morning struck, 
                she declared herself vanquished, and said to her husband, &quot;I'm 
                going to bed.</p>
              <p> 　　Do as you like.&quot; Her husband seated himself at a table 
                in the corner, lighted a candle, and began to read the Courrier 
                Francais.</p>
              <p> 　　A good hour passed thus.</p>
              <p> 　　The worthy inn-keeper had perused the Courrier Francais at 
                least three times, from the date of the number to the printer's 
                name.</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger did not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked 
                his chair.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a movement on the man's part.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is he asleep?&quot; thought Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.</p>
              <p> 　　At last Thenardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to 
                him, and ventured to say:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is not Monsieur going to his repose?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. 
                To repose smacked of luxury and respect.</p>
              <p> 　　These words possess the mysterious and admirable property 
                of swelling the bill on the following day.</p>
              <p> 　　A chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous; a chamber in 
                which one reposes costs twenty francs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well!&quot; said the stranger, &quot;you are right.</p>
              <p> 　　Where is your stable?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir!&quot; exclaimed Thenardier, with a smile, &quot;I 
                will conduct you, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, 
                and Thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, 
                which was of rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a 
                low bedstead, curtained with red calico.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is this?&quot; said the traveller.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is really our bridal chamber,&quot; said the tavern-keeper. 
                &quot;My wife and I occupy another.</p>
              <p> 　　This is only entered three or four times a year.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should have liked the stable quite as well,&quot; 
                said the man, abruptly.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.</p>
              <p> 　　He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on 
                the chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.</p>
              <p> 　　On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's 
                head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what is this?&quot; resumed the stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That, sir,&quot; said Thenardier, &quot;is my wife's 
                wedding bonnet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed 
                to say, &quot;There really was a time, then, when that monster 
                was a maiden?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier lied, however.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of 
                converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber decorated 
                in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and obtained 
                the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this would 
                cast a graceful shadow on &quot;his spouse,&quot; and would result 
                in what the English call respectability for his house.</p>
              <p> 　　When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. 
                Thenardier had withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish 
                him a good night, as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful 
                cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following 
                morning.</p>
              <p> 　　The inn-keeper retired to his room.</p>
              <p> 　　His wife was in bed, but she was not asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　When she heard her husband's step she turned over and said 
                to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know, I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors 
                to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier replied coldly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How you do go on!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their 
                candle was extinguished.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his 
                bundle in a corner.</p>
              <p> 　　The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an arm-chair 
                and remained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed 
                his shoes, took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened 
                the door, and quitted the room, gazing about him like a person 
                who is in search of something. He traversed a corridor and came 
                upon a staircase.</p>
              <p> 　　There he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing 
                of a child. He followed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular 
                recess built under the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase 
                itself. This recess was nothing else than the space under the 
                steps. There, in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, 
                among dust and spiders' webs, was a bed--if one can call by the 
                name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the 
                straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet.</p>
              <p> 　　No sheets. This was placed on the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　In this bed Cosette was sleeping.</p>
              <p> 　　The man approached and gazed down upon her.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed.</p>
              <p> 　　In the winter she did not undress, in order that she might 
                not be so cold.</p>
              <p> 　　Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, 
                wide open, glittered in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she 
                were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost 
                convulsively in her arms.</p>
              <p> 　　Beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　A door which stood open near Cosette's pallet permitted a 
                view of a rather large, dark room.</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger stepped into it. At the further extremity, through 
                a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.</p>
              <p> 　　They belonged to Eponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and 
                half hidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the 
                little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with 
                that of the Thenardier pair.</p>
              <p> 　　He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the 
                fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always 
                so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so 
                cold to look at.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no fire in this one, there was not even ashes; but 
                there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze, nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shape and 
                unequal in size.</p>
              <p> 　　The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom 
                in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney 
                on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling 
                gift from their good fairy. Eponine and Azelma had taken care 
                not to omit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on 
                the hearth.</p>
              <p> 　　The traveller bent over them.</p>
              <p> 　　The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid 
                her visit, and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou 
                piece.</p>
              <p> 　　The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing, 
                when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight 
                of another object.</p>
              <p> 　　He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a frightful 
                shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all covered 
                with ashes and dried mud.</p>
              <p> 　　It was Cosette's sabot. Cosette, with that touching trust 
                of childhood, which can always be deceived yet never discouraged, 
                had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.</p>
              <p> 　　Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is 
                a sweet and touching thing.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing in this wooden shoe.</p>
              <p> 　　The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed 
                a louis d'or in Cosette's shoe.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of 
                a wolf.</p>

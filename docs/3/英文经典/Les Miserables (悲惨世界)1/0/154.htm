              <p> 　　A BIT OF HISTORY</p>
              <p> 　　 At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action 
                of this book takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a 
                policeman at the corner of every street (a benefit which there 
                is no time to discuss here); stray children abounded in Paris. 
                The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless 
                children picked up annually at that period, by the police patrols, 
                in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction, and 
                under the arches of the bridges.</p>
              <p> 　　One of these nests, which has become famous, produced &quot;the 
                swallows of the bridge of Arcola.&quot; This is, moreover, the 
                most disastrous of social symptoms. All crimes of the man begin 
                in the vagabondage of the child.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　In a relative measure, and in spite of the souvenir which 
                we have just recalled, the exception is just.</p>
              <p> 　　While in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost 
                man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in some 
                sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in 
                the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the 
                street boy of Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced 
                and injured on the surface, is almost intact on the interior.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a magnificent thing to put on record, and one which 
                shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, 
                that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists 
                in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. 
                To breathe Paris preserves the soul.</p>
              <p> 　　What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of 
                heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these 
                children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the 
                threads of a broken family.</p>
              <p> 　　In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still 
                is, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured 
                families pouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing 
                clearly what has become of their children, and allowing their 
                own entrails to fall on the public highway. Hence these obscure 
                destinies.</p>
              <p> 　　This is called, for this sad thing has given rise to an expression, 
                &quot;to be cast on the pavements of Paris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children 
                was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy.</p>
              <p> 　　A little of Egypt and Bohemia in the lower regions suited 
                the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of the powerful.</p>
              <p> 　　The hatred of instruction for the children of the people was 
                a dogma.</p>
              <p> 　　What is the use of &quot;half-lights&quot;? Such was the countersign.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, 
                and in that case it skimmed the streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly 
                desired to create a fleet.</p>
              <p> 　　The idea was a good one.</p>
              <p> 　　But let us consider the means.</p>
              <p> 　　There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that plaything 
                of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of necessity, 
                there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, either by 
                means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine 
                what steamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but 
                the galley is moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves 
                were required.</p>
              <p> 　　Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments 
                make as many convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great 
                deal of complaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the 
                presence of a procession--it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent 
                to the galleys.</p>
              <p> 　　A child was encountered in the streets; provided that he was 
                fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he 
                was sent to the galleys. Grand reign; grand century.</p>
              <p> 　　Under Louis XV.</p>
              <p> 　　children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them off, 
                for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered with 
                terror monstrous conjectures as to the king's baths of purple.</p>
              <p> 　　Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened 
                that the exempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, 
                took those who had fathers.</p>
              <p> 　　The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts.</p>
              <p> 　　In that case, the parliament intervened and had some one hung.</p>
              <p> 　　Who?</p>
              <p> 　　The exempts?</p>
              <p> 　　No, the fathers.</p>

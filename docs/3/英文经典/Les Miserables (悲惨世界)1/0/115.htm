              <p> 　　WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS</p>
              <p> 　　 At that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible 
                at some distance.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched 
                into the Rue Polonceau.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw the gleam of their bayonets.</p>
              <p> 　　They were advancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose 
                head he distinguished Javert's tall figure, advanced slowly and 
                cautiously.</p>
              <p> 　　They halted frequently; it was plain that they were searching 
                all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors 
                and alleys.</p>
              <p> 　　This was some patrol that Javert had encountered--there could 
                be no mistake as to this surmise--and whose aid he had demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks.</p>
              <p> 　　At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration 
                of the halts which they were making, it would take them about 
                a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. 
                It was a frightful moment.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible 
                precipice which yawned before him for the third time.</p>
              <p> 　　And the galleys now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette 
                lost to him forever; that is to say, a life resembling the interior 
                of a tomb.</p>
              <p> 　　There was but one thing which was possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one 
                might say, two beggar's pouches:</p>
              <p> 　　in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other the redoubtable 
                talents of a convict.</p>
              <p> 　　He rummaged in the one or the other, according to circumstances.</p>
              <p> 　　Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes 
                from the prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a 
                past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder 
                or climbing-irons, by sheer muscular force, by leaning on the 
                nape of his neck, his shoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping 
                himself on the rare projections of the stone, in the right angle 
                of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need be; an art which 
                has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the 
                wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned 
                to death, made his escape twenty years ago.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he 
                espied the linden; it was about eighteen feet in height.</p>
              <p> 　　The angle which it formed with the gable of the large building 
                was filled, at its lower extremity, by a mass of masonry of a 
                triangular shape, probably intended to preserve that too convenient 
                corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by. 
                This practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use 
                in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the 
                summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more 
                than fourteen feet.</p>
              <p> 　　The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb 
                a wall. Should he abandon her?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was impossible 
                to carry her.</p>
              <p> 　　A man's whole strength is required to successfully carry out 
                these singular ascents.</p>
              <p> 　　The least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull 
                him downwards.</p>
              <p> 　　A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none.</p>
              <p> 　　Where was he to get a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau?</p>
              <p> 　　Certainly, if Jean Valjean had had a kingdom, he would have 
                given it for a rope at that moment.</p>
              <p> 　　All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which 
                sometimes dazzle, sometimes illuminate us.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post 
                of the blind alley Genrot.</p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. 
                At nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; 
                they were ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed 
                the street from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of 
                the post. The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath 
                the lantern in a little iron box, the key to which was kept by 
                the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected by a metal 
                case.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed 
                the street at one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch 
                of the little box with the point of his knife, and an instant 
                later he was beside Cosette once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a rope.</p>
              <p> 　　These gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they 
                are fighting against fatality.</p>
              <p> 　　We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted 
                that night.</p>
              <p> 　　The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct, 
                like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even 
                noticing that it was no longer in its place.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean's 
                absorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all 
                had begun to render Cosette uneasy.</p>
              <p> 　　Any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks 
                long before.</p>
              <p> 　　She contented herself with plucking Jean Valjean by the skirt 
                of his coat.</p>
              <p> 　　They could hear the sound of the patrol's approach ever more 
                and more distinctly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father,&quot; said she, in a very low voice, &quot;I 
                am afraid.</p>
              <p> 　　Who is coming yonder?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hush!&quot; replied the unhappy man; &quot;it is Madame 
                Thenardier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　He added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Say nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't interfere with me.</p>
              <p> 　　If you cry out, if you weep, the Thenardier is lying in wait 
                for you.</p>
              <p> 　　She is coming to take you back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, 
                with firm and curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment 
                when the patrol and Javert might come upon him at any moment, 
                he undid his cravat, passed it round Cosette's body under the 
                armpits, taking care that it should not hurt the child, fastened 
                this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of that knot which 
                seafaring men call a &quot;swallow knot,&quot; took the other 
                end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, 
                which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, 
                and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable 
                with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds 
                of a ladder under his feet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed 
                when he was resting on his knees on the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering 
                a word. Jean Valjean's injunction, and the name of Madame Thenardier, 
                had chilled her blood.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once she heard Jean Valjean's voice crying to her, 
                though in a very low tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Put your back against the wall.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She obeyed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't say a word, and don't be alarmed,&quot; went on 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　And she felt herself lifted from the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top 
                of the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two 
                tiny hands in his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach 
                and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant.</p>
              <p> 　　As he had guessed, there stood a building whose roof started 
                from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a 
                very short distance of the ground, with a gentle slope which grazed 
                the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, <br>
                for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side. 
                Jean Valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet 
                left the crest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the 
                arrival of the patrol.</p>
              <p> 　　The thundering voice of Javert was audible:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Search the blind alley!</p>
              <p> 　　The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue Petit-Picpus. 
                I'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still 
                holding fast to Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to 
                the ground. Whether from terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed 
                a sound, though her hands were a little abraded.</p>

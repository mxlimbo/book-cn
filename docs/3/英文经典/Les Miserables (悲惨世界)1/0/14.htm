              <p> 　　WHAT HE BELIEVED</p>
              <p> 　　 We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score 
                of orthodoxy.</p>
              <p> 　　In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood 
                but respect.</p>
              <p> 　　The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible 
                development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs 
                from our own.</p>
              <p> 　　What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery?</p>
              <p> 　　These secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are 
                known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked.</p>
              <p> 　　The point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties 
                of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case.</p>
              <p> 　　No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent 
                of his powers.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Credo in Patrem,&quot; he often exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction 
                which suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, 
                &quot;Thou art with God!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside 
                of and beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess 
                of love.</p>
              <p> 　　In was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved 
                much--that he was regarded as vulnerable by &quot;serious men,&quot; 
                &quot;grave persons&quot; and &quot;reasonable people&quot;; favorite 
                locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command 
                from pedantry. What was this excess of love?</p>
              <p> 　　It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have 
                already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to 
                things.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation.</p>
              <p> 　　Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness 
                which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of 
                that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have 
                weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him 
                not, and did not arouse his indignation.</p>
              <p> 　　He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as though 
                he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which 
                is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them.</p>
              <p> 　　He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties.</p>
              <p> 　　He examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist 
                who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still 
                exists in nature.</p>
              <p> 　　This revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings.</p>
              <p> 　　One morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, 
                but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him:</p>
              <p> 　　suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it 
                was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider.</p>
              <p> 　　His sister heard him say:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Poor beast!</p>
              <p> 　　It is not its fault!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of 
                kindness? Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were 
                peculiar to Saint Francis d'Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius.</p>
              <p> 　　One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping 
                on an ant. Thus lived this just man.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was 
                nothing more venerable possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent 
                his youth, and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, 
                a passionate, and, possibly, a violent man.</p>
              <p> 　　His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than 
                the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart 
                through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought 
                by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist 
                apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; 
                these formations are indestructible.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his 
                seventy-fifth birthday, but he did not appear to be more than 
                sixty.</p>
              <p> 　　He was not tall; he was rather plump; and, in order to combat 
                this tendency, he was fond of taking long strolls on foot; his 
                step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail from 
                which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion.</p>
              <p> 　　Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and 
                smiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a &quot;fine 
                head,&quot; but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was 
                fine.</p>
              <p> 　　When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one 
                of his charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt 
                at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole 
                person.</p>
              <p> 　　His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all 
                of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, 
                gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made 
                of a man, &quot;He's a good fellow&quot;; and of an old man, &quot;He 
                is a fine man.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That, it will be recalled, was the effect which he produced 
                upon Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　On the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the first 
                time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man.</p>
              <p> 　　But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him 
                in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, 
                and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad 
                and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august 
                also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, 
                though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one experienced 
                something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling 
                angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Respect, an unutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees 
                and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before him 
                one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where 
                thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of 
                religion, alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation 
                of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, 
                confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life.</p>
              <p> 　　Filled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was 
                quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather 
                prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going 
                to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a 
                sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation 
                in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard 
                him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the 
                night.</p>
              <p> 　　He was there alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, 
                comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, 
                moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations 
                and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts 
                which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered 
                his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, 
                illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself 
                out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, 
                he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in 
                his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something 
                descend into him.</p>
              <p> 　　Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses 
                of the universe!</p>
              <p> 　　He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future 
                eternity, that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery 
                still more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their 
                way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking 
                to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not study God; he was dazzled by him.</p>
              <p> 　　He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which 
                communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, 
                create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable 
                in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions 
                are formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.</p>
              <p> 　　He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against 
                a decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted 
                silhouettes of his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly 
                planted, so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear 
                to him, and satisfied his wants.</p>
              <p> 　　What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure 
                of his life, where there was so little leisure, between gardening 
                in the daytime and contemplation at night?</p>
              <p> 　　Was not this narrow enclosure, with the heavens for a ceiling, 
                sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works, 
                in turn?</p>
              <p> 　　Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is there left 
                to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensity 
                in which to dream. At one's feet that which can be cultivated 
                and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate upon:</p>
              <p> 　　some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.</p>

              <p> 　　ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO</p>
              <p> 　　 To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like 
                the graeculus of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace 
                with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a 
                disease; a disease which must be cured, how?</p>
              <p> 　　By light.</p>
              <p> 　　Light renders healthy.</p>
              <p> 　　Light kindles.</p>
              <p> 　　All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, 
                arts, education.</p>
              <p> 　　Make men, make men.</p>
              <p> 　　Give them light that they may warm you. Sooner or later the 
                splendid question of universal education will present itself with 
                the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; and then, those 
                who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have 
                to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of Paris; 
                flames in the light or will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.</p>
              <p> 　　For Paris is a total.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole of this 
                prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living 
                manners.</p>
              <p> 　　He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history 
                with heaven and constellations in the intervals.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris has a capital, the Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, 
                a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the 
                Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a Via Sacra, the Boulevard 
                des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion; and it replaces 
                the Gemoniae by ridicule. Its majo is called &quot;faraud,&quot; 
                its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is the 
                market-porter, its lazzarone is the pegre, its cockney is the 
                native of Ghent.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　The fishwoman of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of 
                Euripides, the discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the 
                tight-rope dancer.</p>
              <p> 　　Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncoeur 
                the grenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy 
                among bric-a-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in 
                its fist as just as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la 
                Reyniere discovered larded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast 
                hedgehog, we see the trapeze which figures in Plautus reappear 
                under the vault of the Arc of l'Etoile, the sword-eater of Poecilus 
                encountered by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on the PontNeuf, 
                the nephew of Rameau and Curculio the parasite make a pair, Ergasilus 
                could get himself presented to Cambaceres by d'Aigrefeuille; the 
                four dandies of Rome:</p>
              <p> 　　Alcesimarchus, Phoedromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend 
                from Courtille in Labatut's posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would 
                halt no longer in front of Congrio than would Charles Nodier in 
                front of Punchinello; Marto is not a tigress, but Pardalisca was 
                not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in the Cafe Anglais at 
                Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor in the Champs-Elysees, 
                and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like Bobeche, takes up 
                a collection; the bore who stops you by the button of your coat 
                in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand 
                years Thesprion's apostrophe:</p>
              <p> 　　Quis properantem me prehendit pallio? The wine on Surene is 
                a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border of Desaugiers forms 
                a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, Pere Lachaise exhales 
                beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as the Esquiliae, and the 
                grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly the equivalent 
                of the slave's hived coffin.</p>
              <p> 　　Seek something that Paris has not.</p>
              <p> 　　The vat of Trophonius contains nothing that is not in Mesmer's 
                tub; Ergaphilas lives again in Cagliostro; the Brahmin Vasaphanta 
                become incarnate in the Comte de Saint-Germain; the cemetery of 
                Saint-Medard works quite as good miracles as the Mosque of Oumoumie 
                at Damascus.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris has an AEsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. 
                It is terrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of 
                the vision; it makes tables turn as Dodona did tripods.</p>
              <p> 　　It places the grisette on the throne, as Rome placed the courtesan 
                there; and, taking it altogether, if Louis XV.</p>
              <p> 　　is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than Messalina.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed 
                and which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, 
                and the Gascon pun. It mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, 
                dresses up a spectre in old numbers of the Constitutional, and 
                makes Chodruc Duclos.</p>
              <p> 　　Although Plutarch says:</p>
              <p> 　　the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla as under Domitian, 
                resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine.</p>
              <p> 　　The Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made 
                of it by Varus Vibiscus is to be credited:</p>
              <p> 　　Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem 
                oblivisci. Paris drinks a million litres of water a day, but that 
                does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm 
                and ringing the tocsin.</p>
              <p> 　　With that exception, Paris is amiable.</p>
              <p> 　　It accepts everything royally; it is not too particular about 
                its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot; provided that it is made 
                to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it, deformity provokes 
                it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and you may be an 
                eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does not disgust 
                it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before Basile, 
                and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace 
                was repelled by the &quot;hiccup&quot; of Priapus. No trait of 
                the universal face is lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal 
                Mabile is not the polymnia dance of the Janiculum, but the dealer 
                in ladies' wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her 
                eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in wait for the virgin 
                Planesium.</p>
              <p> 　　The Barriere du Combat is not the Coliseum, but people are 
                as ferocious there as though Caesar were looking on. The Syrian 
                hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil haunted 
                the Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzac and Charlet have sat 
                at the tables of Parisian taverns.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper 
                there. Adonai passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of 
                thunder and lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass.</p>
              <p> 　　For Silenus read Ramponneau.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, 
                Jerusalem, Pantin.</p>
              <p> 　　All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms 
                also.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.</p>
              <p> 　　A little of the Place de Greve is a good thing.</p>
              <p> 　　What would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning?</p>
              <p> 　　Our laws are wisely provided, and thanks to them, this blade 
                drips on this Shrove Tuesday.</p>

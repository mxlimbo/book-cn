              <p> 　　TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS</p>
              <p> 　　 So far in this book the Thenardiers have been viewed only 
                in profile; the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this 
                couple, and considering it under all its aspects.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier 
                was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a 
                woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband 
                and wife.</p>
              <p> 　　Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this 
                Thenardier woman, ever since her first appearance,--tall, blond, 
                red, fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, 
                as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who 
                contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their 
                hair. She did everything about the house,--made the beds, did 
                the washing, the cooking, and everything else.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an 
                elephant.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,--window panes, 
                furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches, 
                presented the appearance of a skimmer.</p>
              <p> 　　She had a beard.</p>
              <p> 　　She was an ideal market-porter dressed in woman's clothes.</p>
              <p> 　　She swore splendidly; she boasted of being able to crack a 
                nut with one blow of her fist.</p>
              <p> 　　Except for the romances which she had read, and which made 
                the affected lady peep through the ogress at times, in a very 
                queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any one to say 
                of her, &quot;That is a woman.&quot; This Thenardier female was 
                like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife.</p>
              <p> 　　When one heard her speak, one said, &quot;That is a gendarme&quot;; 
                when one saw her drink, one said, &quot;That is a carter&quot;; 
                when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, &quot;That is the hangman.&quot; 
                One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble 
                man, who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy.</p>
              <p> 　　His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, 
                and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom 
                he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat and 
                the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits 
                of the Abbe Delille. His coquetry consisted in drinking with the 
                carters.</p>
              <p> 　　No one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk.</p>
              <p> 　　He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse 
                an old black coat.</p>
              <p> 　　He made pretensions to literature and to materialism.</p>
              <p> 　　There were certain names which he often pronounced to support 
                whatever things he might be saying,--Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, 
                and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine.</p>
              <p> 　　He declared that he had &quot;a system.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In addition, he was a great swindler.</p>
              <p> 　　A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species 
                does exist.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in 
                the army; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, 
                being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light something or other, 
                at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a squadron of 
                death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved from death, 
                in the midst of the grape-shot, &quot;a general, who had been 
                dangerously wounded.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn 
                the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of &quot;the cabaret 
                of the Sergeant of Waterloo.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was a liberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist.</p>
              <p> 　　He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in the 
                village that he had studied for the priesthood.</p>
              <p> 　　We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. 
                This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming 
                from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, 
                being comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess 
                at Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb 
                and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; 
                a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently 
                at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier belonged to that 
                variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating 
                about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and 
                travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety 
                cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for 
                always attaching himself to the victorious army.</p>
              <p> 　　This campaign ended, and having, as he said, &quot;some quibus,&quot; 
                he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.</p>
              <p> 　　This quibus, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings 
                and silver crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with 
                corpses, did not amount to a large total, and did not carry this 
                sutler turned eating-house-keeper very far.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his 
                gestures which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, 
                and by a sign of the cross, the seminary.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be thought that he 
                was an educated man.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced 
                improperly.[12]</p>
              <p> 　　 [12] Literally &quot;made cuirs&quot;; i.</p>
              <p> 　　e., pronounced a t or an s at the end of words where the opposite 
                letter should occur, or used either one of them where neither 
                exists.</p>
              <p> 　　 He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, 
                but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in 
                it. Thenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not disdain his servants, which caused his wife to 
                dispense with them. This giantess was jealous.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must 
                be an object coveted by all.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced 
                man, was a scamp of a temperate sort.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters into it.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not that Thenardier was not, on occasion, capable of 
                wrath to quite the same degree as his wife; but this was very 
                rare, and at such times, since he was enraged with the human race 
                in general, as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred.</p>
              <p> 　　And since he was one of those people who are continually avenging 
                their wrongs, who accuse everything that passes before them of 
                everything which has befallen them, and who are always ready to 
                cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a legitimate 
                grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies, 
                and the calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred 
                up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. 
                Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to his other qualities, Thenardier was attentive 
                and penetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, 
                and always highly intelligent.</p>
              <p> 　　He had something of the look of sailors, who are accustomed 
                to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was a statesman.</p>
              <p> 　　Every new-comer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight 
                of Madame Thenardier, &quot;There is the master of the house.&quot; 
                A mistake.</p>
              <p> 　　She was not even the mistress.</p>
              <p> 　　The husband was both master and mistress.</p>
              <p> 　　She worked; he created.</p>
              <p> 　　He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant 
                magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; 
                the mastodon obeyed. Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign 
                being in Madame Thenardier's eyes, though she did not thoroughly 
                realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if 
                she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with &quot;Monsieur 
                Thenardier,&quot;--which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the 
                way,--she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject 
                whatever.</p>
              <p> 　　She would never have committed &quot;before strangers&quot; 
                that mistake so often committed by women, and which is called 
                in parliamentary language, &quot;exposing the crown.&quot; Although 
                their concord had only evil as its result, there was contemplation 
                in Madame Thenardier's submission to her husband. That mountain 
                of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail 
                despot.</p>
              <p> 　　Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side, this was that grand 
                and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certain 
                ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty.</p>
              <p> 　　There was an unknown quantity about Thenardier; hence the 
                absolute empire of the man over that woman.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle; at 
                others she felt him like a claw.</p>
              <p> 　　This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except 
                her children, and who did not fear any one except her husband. 
                She was a mother because she was mammiferous.</p>
              <p> 　　But her maternity stopped short with her daughters, and, as 
                we shall see, did not extend to boys.</p>
              <p> 　　The man had but one thought,--how to enrich himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not succeed in this.</p>
              <p> 　　A theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is 
                possible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless 
                scamp would have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must 
                browse where fate has hitched him.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed 
                in a restricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.</p>
              <p> 　　In this same year, 1823, Thenardier was burdened with about 
                fifteen hundred francs' worth of petty debts, and this rendered 
                him anxious.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny 
                in this case, Thenardier was one of those men who understand best, 
                with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion, that 
                thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object 
                of merchandise among civilized peoples,--hospitality.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quoted for his skill 
                in shooting.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh, which was particularly 
                dangerous.</p>
              <p> 　　His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning 
                flashes. He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into 
                his wife's mind. &quot;The duty of the inn-keeper,&quot; he said 
                to her one day, violently, and in a low voice, &quot;is to sell 
                to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire, dirty sheets, 
                a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to empty small 
                purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter travelling 
                families respectfully:</p>
              <p> 　　to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pick the child clean; 
                to quote the window open, the window shut, the chimney-corner, 
                the arm-chair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the feather-bed, 
                the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much the shadow 
                uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five hundred 
                thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even 
                for the flies which his dog eats!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded--a hideous 
                and terrible team.</p>
              <p> 　　While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thenardier 
                thought not of absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor 
                of to-morrow, and lived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.</p>
              <p> 　　Such were these two beings.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was between them, subjected to their double pressure, 
                like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill 
                and pulled to pieces with pincers.</p>
              <p> 　　The man and the woman each had a different method:</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was overwhelmed with blows--this was the woman's; 
                she went barefooted in winter-- that was the man's doing.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette ran up stairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, 
                ran, fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as 
                she was, did the coarse work.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and venomous 
                master.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier hostelry was like a spider's web, in which 
                Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal 
                of oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was 
                something like the fly serving the spiders.</p>
              <p> 　　The poor child passively held her peace.</p>
              <p> 　　What takes place within these souls when they have but just 
                quitted God, find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very 
                small and in the midst of men all naked!</p>

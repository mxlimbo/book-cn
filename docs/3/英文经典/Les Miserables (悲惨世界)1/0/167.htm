              <p> 　　IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN</p>
              <p> 　　 With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he 
                was furious at being in despair.</p>
              <p> 　　He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal 
                satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he 
                had remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for 
                such.</p>
              <p> 　　This he called having &quot;royal renown.&quot; This royal 
                renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls. One day, 
                there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had been a 
                basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling like 
                the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, 
                dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand 
                had, at that time, fully completed his eighty-fourth year.</p>
              <p> 　　Indignation and uproar in the establishment. And whom did 
                that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? What 
                audacity!</p>
              <p> 　　What an abominable calumny!</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand himself was not at all enraged.</p>
              <p> 　　He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man 
                who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an aside: &quot;Well, 
                what now?</p>
              <p> 　　What's the matter?</p>
              <p> 　　You are finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively 
                ignorant.</p>
              <p> 　　M. le Duc d'Angouleme, the bastard of his Majesty Charles 
                IX., married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty-five; 
                M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother to the Cardinal de Sourdis, 
                Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of eighty-three, by the 
                maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin, a son, a real child of love, 
                who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of state; one 
                of the great men of this century, the Abbe Tabaraud, is the son 
                of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary 
                in these things.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this little 
                gentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not his fault.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose 
                name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a boy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated.</p>
              <p> 　　He sent the two brats back to their mother, promising to pay 
                eighty francs a month for their maintenance, on the condition 
                that the said mother would not do so any more.</p>
              <p> 　　He added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well.</p>
              <p> 　　I shall go to see them from time to time.&quot; And this he 
                did.</p>
              <p> 　　He had had a brother who was a priest, and who had been rector 
                of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years, and had 
                died at seventy-nine. &quot;I lost him young,&quot; said he. This 
                brother, of whom but little memory remains, was a peaceable miser, 
                who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestow alms on the 
                poor whom he met, but he never gave them anything except bad or 
                demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going to hell 
                by way of paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he never haggled over his 
                alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, 
                charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have 
                been magnificent.</p>
              <p> 　　He desired that all which concerned him should be done in 
                a grand manner, even his rogueries.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, having been cheated by a business man in a matter 
                of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered this 
                solemn exclamation:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That was indecently done! I am really ashamed of this 
                pilfering.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals.</p>
              <p> 　　Morbleu! this is not the way to rob a man of my standing.</p>
              <p> 　　I am robbed as though in a forest, but badly robbed.</p>
              <p> 　　Silva, sint consule dignae!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had had two wives, as we have already mentioned; by the 
                first he had had a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by 
                the second another daughter, who had died at about the age of 
                thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance, or otherwise, 
                a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the Republic 
                and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had 
                been made colonel at Waterloo. &quot;He is the disgrace of my 
                family,&quot; said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount 
                of snuff, and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at 
                his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. He believed very little 
                in God.</p>

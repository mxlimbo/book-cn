              <p> 　　ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL</p>
              <p> 　　 The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, 
                as the reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. 
                These booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would 
                soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning 
                in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the 
                table at the Thenardiers' observed, produced &quot;a magical effect.&quot; 
                In compensation, not a star was visible in the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the 
                Thenardiers' door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, 
                glass, and magnificent objects of tin.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed 
                on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two 
                feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold 
                wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　All that day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment 
                of all passers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being 
                found in Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant 
                to give it to her child. Eponine and Azelma had passed hours in 
                contemplating it, and Cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance 
                at it, on the sly, it is true.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy 
                and overcome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her 
                eyes to that wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. 
                The poor child paused in amazement.</p>
              <p> 　　She had not yet beheld that doll close to.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a 
                doll; it was a vision.</p>
              <p> 　　It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in 
                a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly 
                engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery.</p>
              <p> 　　With the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured 
                the abyss which separated her from that doll. She said to herself 
                that one must be a queen, or at least a princess, to have a &quot;thing&quot; 
                like that.</p>
              <p> 　　She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth 
                hair, and she thought, &quot;How happy that doll must be!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. The 
                more she looked, the more dazzled she grew.</p>
              <p> 　　She thought she was gazing at paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　There were other dolls behind the large one, which seemed 
                to her to be fairies and genii.</p>
              <p> 　　The merchant, who was pacing back and forth in front of his 
                shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of being the Eternal 
                Father.</p>
              <p> 　　In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with 
                which she was charged.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once the Thenardier's coarse voice recalled her to 
                reality: &quot;What, you silly jade! you have not gone?</p>
              <p> 　　Wait!</p>
              <p> 　　I'll give it to you!</p>
              <p> 　　I want to know what you are doing there!</p>
              <p> 　　Get along, you little monster!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier had cast a glance into the street, and had 
                caught sight of Cosette in her ecstasy.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides 
                of which she was capable.</p>

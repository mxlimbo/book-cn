              <p> 　　WHAT HE DOES</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean listened.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a sound.</p>
              <p> 　　He gave the door a push.</p>
              <p> 　　He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with 
                the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of 
                entering.</p>
              <p> 　　The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible 
                and silent movement, which enlarged the opening a little.</p>
              <p> 　　He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder 
                push.</p>
              <p> 　　It continued to yield in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　The opening was now large enough to allow him to pass.</p>
              <p> 　　But near the door there stood a little table, which formed 
                an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty.</p>
              <p> 　　It was necessary, at any cost, to enlarge the aperture still 
                further.</p>
              <p> 　　He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third 
                push, more energetic than the two preceding.</p>
              <p> 　　This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence 
                a hoarse and prolonged cry.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of 
                the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of Judgment.</p>
              <p> 　　In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost 
                imagined that that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly 
                assumed a terrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to 
                arouse every one, and warn and to wake those who were asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the 
                tips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries in his 
                temples beating like two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that 
                his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing 
                from a cavern.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that 
                irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, 
                like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, had 
                taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at once; 
                the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their 
                assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be 
                in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought 
                himself lost.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, 
                not daring to make a movement.</p>
              <p> 　　Several minutes elapsed.</p>
              <p> 　　The door had fallen wide open.</p>
              <p> 　　He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred 
                there.</p>
              <p> 　　He lent an ear.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing was moving in the house.</p>
              <p> 　　The noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.</p>
              <p> 　　This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful 
                tumult within him.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he did not retreat.</p>
              <p> 　　Even when he had thought himself lost, he had not drawn back.</p>
              <p> 　　His only thought now was to finish as soon as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　He took a step and entered the room.</p>
              <p> 　　This room was in a state of perfect calm.</p>
              <p> 　　Here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable, 
                which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table, open folios, 
                volumes piled upon a stool, an arm-chair heaped with clothing, 
                a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were only shadowy corners 
                and whitish spots.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean advanced with precaution, taking care not to 
                knock against the furniture. He could hear, at the extremity of 
                the room, the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　He suddenly came to a halt.</p>
              <p> 　　He was near the bed.</p>
              <p> 　　He had arrived there sooner than he had thought for.</p>
              <p> 　　Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with 
                our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though 
                she desired to make us reflect.</p>
              <p> 　　For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, 
                this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing 
                the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face.</p>
              <p> 　　He was sleeping peacefully.</p>
              <p> 　　He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of 
                the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which 
                covered his arms to the wrists.</p>
              <p> 　　His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless attitude 
                of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence 
                had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions, was hanging 
                over the edge of the bed.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, 
                of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost 
                a radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light 
                which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep 
                a mysterious heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that 
                heaven was within him.</p>
              <p> 　　That heaven was his conscience.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, 
                so to speak, upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed 
                as in a glory. It remained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable 
                half-light. That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that 
                garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, 
                the moment, the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality 
                to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort of 
                serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, 
                that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head 
                of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.</p>
              <p> 　　There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus 
                august, without being himself aware of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with 
                his iron candlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous 
                old man. Never had he beheld anything like this.</p>
              <p> 　　This confidence terrified him. The moral world has no grander 
                spectacle than this:</p>
              <p> 　　a troubled and uneasy conscience, which has arrived on the 
                brink of an evil action, contemplating the slumber of the just.</p>
              <p> 　　That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, 
                had about it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously 
                conscious.</p>
              <p> 　　No one could have told what was passing within him, not even 
                himself. In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary 
                to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the 
                most gentle. Even on his visage it would have been impossible 
                to distinguish anything with certainty.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and 
                that was all.</p>
              <p> 　　But what was his thought? It would have been impossible to 
                divine it.</p>
              <p> 　　What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded.</p>
              <p> 　　But what was the nature of this emotion?</p>
              <p> 　　His eye never quitted the old man.</p>
              <p> 　　The only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude 
                and his physiognomy was a strange indecision. One would have said 
                that he was hesitating between the two abysses,-- the one in which 
                one loses one's self and that in which one saves one's self.</p>
              <p> 　　He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand.</p>
              <p> 　　At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly 
                towards his brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back 
                with the same deliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating 
                once more, his cap in his left hand, his club in his right hand, 
                his hair bristling all over his savage head.</p>
              <p> 　　The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that 
                terrifying gaze.</p>
              <p> 　　The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix 
                over the chimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms 
                to both of them, with a benediction for one and pardon for the 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped 
                rapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight 
                to the cupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron 
                candlestick as though to force the lock; the key was there; he 
                opened it; the first thing which presented itself to him was the 
                basket of silverware; he seized it, traversed the chamber with 
                long strides, without taking any precautions and without troubling 
                himself about the noise, gained the door, re-entered the oratory, 
                opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode the window-sill 
                of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack, threw away 
                the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger, 
                and fled.</p>

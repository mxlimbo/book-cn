              <p> 　　CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA</p>
              <p> 　　 The night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be 
                between one and two o'clock in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had seated herself beside 
                him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean had fancied 
                that she was asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　He bent down and looked at her.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette's eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　She was still trembling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you sleepy?&quot; said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very cold,&quot; she replied.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later she resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is she still there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who?&quot; said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame Thenardier.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had 
                employed to make Cosette keep silent.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; said he, &quot;she is gone.</p>
              <p> 　　You need fear nothing further.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her 
                breast.</p>
              <p> 　　The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze 
                grew more keen every instant.</p>
              <p> 　　The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you less cold now?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, wait for me a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　I will soon be back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking 
                a better shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars 
                at all the windows of the ground floor.</p>
              <p> 　　Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he 
                observed that he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived 
                a light. He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. 
                They all opened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, 
                cut up by arcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great 
                shadows were visible.</p>
              <p> 　　The light came from a taper which was burning in one corner.</p>
              <p> 　　The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived 
                on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, 
                and which resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, 
                flat on the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a 
                cross, in the immobility of death. One would have said, judging 
                from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor, that this 
                sinister form had a rope round its neck.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which 
                are sparely illuminated, which adds to horror.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal 
                spectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything 
                more blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing 
                some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus 
                at night.</p>
              <p> 　　It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; 
                and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive.</p>
              <p> 　　He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to 
                watch whether the thing would move.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long 
                time, the outstretched form made no movement. All at once he felt 
                himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and he fled.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see 
                that form following him with great strides and waving its arms.</p>
              <p> 　　He reached the ruin all out of breath.</p>
              <p> 　　His knees were giving way beneath him; the perspiration was 
                pouring from him.</p>
              <p> 　　Where was he?</p>
              <p> 　　Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre 
                in the midst of Paris!</p>
              <p> 　　What was this strange house? An edifice full of nocturnal 
                mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with the voice 
                of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that terrible 
                vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and then 
                opening the horrible gates of the tomb!</p>
              <p> 　　And it actually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number 
                on the street! It was not a dream!</p>
              <p> 　　He had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was 
                the fact.</p>
              <p> 　　Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had 
                given him a genuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together 
                in his brain.</p>
              <p> 　　He stepped up to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　She was asleep.</p>

              <p> 　　M. BAMATABOIS'S INACTIVITY</p>
              <p> 　　 There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in 
                particular, a class of young men who nibble away an income of 
                fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes 
                devour two hundred thousand francs a year in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　These are beings of the great neuter species:</p>
              <p> 　　impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, 
                a little folly, a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, 
                and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, 
                &quot;My fields, my peasants, my woods&quot;; who hiss actresses 
                at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste; quarrel 
                with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of 
                war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of tobacco, play billiards, 
                stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, live at 
                the cafe, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones under 
                the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; who 
                stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise 
                women, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, and 
                Paris through the medium of Pont-A-Mousson, grow old as dullards, 
                never work, serve no use, and do no great harm.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Felix Tholomyes, had he remained in his own province and 
                never beheld Paris, would have been one of these men.</p>
              <p> 　　If they were richer, one would say, &quot;They are dandies;&quot; 
                if they were poorer, one would say, &quot;They are idlers.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They are simply men without employment.</p>
              <p> 　　Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers, 
                and some knaves.</p>
              <p> 　　At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big 
                cravat, a watch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, 
                worn one on top of the other--the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted 
                olive coat, with a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons 
                set close to each other and running up to the shoulder; and a 
                pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive, ornamented on the 
                two seams with an indefinite, but always uneven, number of lines, 
                varying from one to eleven--a limit which was never exceeded. 
                Add to this, high shoes with little irons on the heels, a tall 
                hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an enormous cane, 
                and conversation set off by puns of Potier.</p>
              <p> 　　Over all, spurs and a mustache.</p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois, and spurs 
                the pedestrian.</p>
              <p> 　　The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest 
                of mustaches.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South 
                America with the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed 
                hats were royalist, and were called morillos; liberals wore hats 
                with wide brims, which were called bolivars.</p>
              <p> 　　Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in 
                the preceding pages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a 
                snowy evening, one of these dandies, one of these unemployed, 
                a &quot;right thinker,&quot; for he wore a morillo, and was, moreover, 
                warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed 
                the fashionable costume in cold weather, was amusing himself by 
                tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress, 
                with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front of the officers' 
                cafe.</p>
              <p> 　　This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly fashionable.</p>
              <p> 　　Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed 
                on her, together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which 
                he considered witty and mirthful, such as, &quot;How ugly you 
                are!-- Will you get out of my sight?--You have no teeth!&quot; 
                etc., etc. This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois.</p>
              <p> 　　The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre which went and 
                came through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance 
                at him, and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and 
                with a sombre regularity, which brought her every five minutes 
                within reach of this sarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns 
                under the rods.</p>
              <p> 　　The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; 
                and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned, he 
                crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf, and stifling his 
                laugh, bent down, picked up a handful of snow from the pavement, 
                and thrust it abruptly into her back, between her bare shoulders.</p>
              <p> 　　The woman uttered a roar, whirled round, gave a leap like 
                a panther, and hurled herself upon the man, burying her nails 
                in his face, with the most frightful words which could fall from 
                the guard-room into the gutter.</p>
              <p> 　　These insults, poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy, 
                did, indeed, proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked 
                its two front teeth. It was Fantine.</p>
              <p> 　　At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs 
                from the cafe, passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, 
                hooting and applauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed 
                of two beings, whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as 
                a man and a woman:</p>
              <p> 　　the man struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking 
                out with feet and fists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, 
                livid with wrath, horrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the 
                crowd, seized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered 
                with mud, and said to her, &quot;Follow me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died 
                away. Her eyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, 
                and she trembled with a quiver of terror.</p>
              <p> 　　She had recognized Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.</p>

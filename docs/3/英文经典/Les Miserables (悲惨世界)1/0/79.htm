              <p> 　　NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR</p>
              <p> 　　 The Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a 
                local trouble, had never been in a better humor than on that day. 
                His impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　On the 18th of June, that profound soul masked by marble beamed 
                blindly. The man who had been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at 
                Waterloo. The greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes.</p>
              <p> 　　Our joys are composed of shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　The supreme smile is God's alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Ridet Caesar, Pompeius flebit, said the legionaries of the 
                Fulminatrix Legion.</p>
              <p> 　　Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it is 
                certain that Caesar laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　While exploring on horseback at one o'clock on the preceding 
                night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, the communes 
                in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of the 
                long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon 
                from Frischemont to Braine-l'Alleud, it had seemed to him that 
                fate, to whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, 
                was exact to the appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained 
                for some time motionless, gazing at the lightning and listening 
                to the thunder; and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness 
                this mysterious saying, &quot;We are in accord.&quot; Napoleon 
                was mistaken.</p>
              <p> 　　They were no longer in accord.</p>
              <p> 　　He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night 
                was marked by a joy for him.</p>
              <p> 　　He traversed the line of the principal outposts, halting here 
                and there to talk to the sentinels.</p>
              <p> 　　At half-past two, near the wood of Hougomont, he heard the 
                tread of a column on the march; he thought at the moment that 
                it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.</p>
              <p> 　　He said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way 
                for the purpose of decamping.</p>
              <p> 　　I will take prisoners the six thousand English who have just 
                arrived at Ostend.&quot; He conversed expansively; he regained 
                the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of 
                March, when he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic 
                peasant of the Gulf Juan, and cried, &quot;Well, Bertrand, here 
                is a reinforcement already!&quot; On the night of the 17th to 
                the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. &quot;That little Englishman 
                needs a lesson,&quot; said Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　The rain redoubled in violence; the thunder rolled while the 
                Emperor was speaking.</p>
              <p> 　　At half-past three o'clock in the morning, he lost one illusion; 
                officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him 
                that the enemy was not making any movement.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing was stirring; not a bivouac-fire had been extinguished; 
                the English army was asleep. The silence on earth was profound; 
                the only noise was in the heavens. At four o'clock, a peasant 
                was brought in to him by the scouts; this peasant had served as 
                guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probably Vivian's brigade, 
                which was on its way to take up a position in the village of Ohain, 
                at the extreme left.</p>
              <p> 　　At five o'clock, two Belgian deserters reported to him that 
                they had just quitted their regiment, and that the English army 
                was ready for battle. &quot;So much the better!&quot; exclaimed 
                Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them 
                back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which 
                forms an angle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and 
                a peasant's chair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated 
                himself, with a truss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on 
                the table the chart of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he 
                did so, &quot;A pretty checker-board.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports 
                of provisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to 
                arrive by morning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet 
                and fasting.</p>
              <p> 　　This did not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to 
                Ney, &quot;We have ninety chances out of a hundred.&quot; At eight 
                o'clock the Emperor's breakfast was brought to him. He invited 
                many generals to it.</p>
              <p> 　　During breakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to 
                a ball two nights before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond's; 
                and Soult, a rough man of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, 
                &quot;The ball takes place to-day.&quot; The Emperor jested with 
                Ney, who said, &quot;Wellington will not be so simple as to wait 
                for Your Majesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That was his way, however. &quot;He was fond of jesting,&quot; 
                says Fleury de Chaboulon.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A merry humor was at the foundation of his character,&quot; 
                says Gourgaud. &quot;He abounded in pleasantries, which were more 
                peculiar than witty,&quot; says Benjamin Constant.</p>
              <p> 　　These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence.</p>
              <p> 　　It was he who called his grenadiers &quot;his grumblers&quot;; 
                he pinched their ears; he pulled their mustaches.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,&quot; 
                is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from 
                the island of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the 
                open sea, the French brig of war, Le Zephyr, having encountered 
                the brig L'Inconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having 
                asked the news of Napoleon from L'Inconstant, the Emperor, who 
                still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with 
                bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized 
                the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, &quot;The Emperor 
                is well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the 
                breakfast at Waterloo.</p>
              <p> 　　After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour; then 
                two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in hand 
                and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them 
                the order of battle.</p>
              <p> 　　At nine o'clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged 
                in echelons and set in motion in five columns, had deployed-- 
                the divisions in two lines, the artillery between the brigades, 
                the music at their head; as they beat the march, with rolls on 
                the drums and the blasts of trumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a 
                sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on the horizon, the 
                Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, &quot;Magnificent!</p>
              <p> 　　Magnificent!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Between nine o'clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible 
                as it may appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself 
                in six lines, forming, to repeat the Emperor's expression, &quot;the 
                figure of six V's.&quot; A few moments after the formation of 
                the battle-array, in the midst of that profound silence, like 
                that which heralds the beginning of a storm, which precedes engagements, 
                the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as he beheld the three 
                batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his orders from the 
                corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin the action 
                by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersection 
                of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, &quot;There 
                are four and twenty handsome maids, General.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed 
                before him, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he 
                had appointed to barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village 
                should be carried.</p>
              <p> 　　All this serenity had been traversed by but a single word 
                of haughty pity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there 
                now stands a large tomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their 
                superb horses, massing themselves, he said, &quot;It is a pity.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected 
                for his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to 
                the right of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his 
                second station during the battle.</p>
              <p> 　　The third station, the one adopted at seven o'clock in the 
                evening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable; 
                it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind 
                which the guard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this 
                knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road, up to 
                Napoleon himself.</p>
              <p> 　　As at Brienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets 
                and of the heavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, 
                and shapeless projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up 
                at the spot where his horse' feet stood.</p>
              <p> 　　Scabra rubigine.</p>
              <p> 　　A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, still charged, and 
                with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was unearthed.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide, 
                Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to 
                the saddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every discharge 
                of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fool, it is shameful!</p>
              <p> 　　You'll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.&quot; 
                He who writes these lines has himself found, in the friable soil 
                of this knoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck 
                of a bomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty 
                years, and old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs 
                between the fingers.</p>
              <p> 　　Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations 
                of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington 
                took place, are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815.</p>
              <p> 　　By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make 
                a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, 
                disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there.</p>
              <p> 　　It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it.</p>
              <p> 　　Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, 
                exclaimed, &quot;They have altered my field of battle!&quot; Where 
                the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, 
                there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the 
                Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side 
                of the highway to Genappe.</p>
              <p> 　　The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by 
                the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which 
                enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels:</p>
              <p> 　　one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German 
                tomb, is on the right.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no French tomb.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth 
                employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and 
                half a mile in circumference, the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is 
                now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of battle, particularly 
                on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and difficult of 
                approach.</p>
              <p> 　　The slope there is so steep that the English cannon could 
                not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley, which 
                was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains 
                had still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated 
                the problem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, 
                but stuck fast in the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran 
                a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant 
                observer to divine.</p>
              <p> 　　What was this trench?</p>
              <p> 　　Let us explain.</p>
              <p> 　　Braine-l'Alleud is a Belgian village; Ohain is another.</p>
              <p> 　　These villages, both of them concealed in curves of the landscape, 
                are connected by a road about a league and a half in length, which 
                traverses the plain along its undulating level, and often enters 
                and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which makes a ravine 
                of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present day, this 
                road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between the 
                two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level 
                with the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have 
                been appropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and 
                still is, a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; 
                a hollow trench, sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, 
                being too steep, crumbled away here and there, particularly in 
                winter, under driving rains.</p>
              <p> 　　Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the Braine-l'Alleud 
                entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as is proved 
                by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which gives 
                the name of the dead, Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels, 
                and the date of the accident, February, 1637.[8] It was so deep 
                on the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise, 
                was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated 
                on another stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the 
                process of clearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal 
                is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the highway 
                between La Haie-Sainte and the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.</p>

                in no way indicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a

                soil, was invisible; that is to say, terrible.</p>

              <p> 　　FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS</p>
              <p> 　　 Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall.</p>
              <p> 　　Father Madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he 
                had established for his workmen in the factory building itself, 
                and which was served by two sisters of charity.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following morning the old man found a thousand-franc 
                bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine's 
                writing:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I purchase your horse and cart.&quot; The cart was broken, 
                and the horse was dead.</p>
              <p> 　　Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of charity 
                and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a female 
                convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor.</p>
              <p> 　　The first time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in 
                the scarf which gave him authority over the town, he felt the 
                sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling 
                a wolf in his master's clothes. From that time forth he avoided 
                him as much as he possibly could. When the requirements of the 
                service imperatively demanded it, and he could not do otherwise 
                than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound respect.</p>
              <p> 　　This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, 
                besides the visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom 
                which was none the less significant for not being visible. This 
                never deceives.</p>
              <p> 　　When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there 
                is no commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, 
                he exhausts and oversteps his respite, and the state expends a 
                great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection.</p>
              <p> 　　When work is abundant, when the country is rich and happy, 
                the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may be 
                said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery 
                and riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of 
                seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished 
                three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led 
                to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest 
                by M. de Villele, then Minister of Finance.</p>
              <p> 　　Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned 
                thither. No one remembered her.</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine's factory was like the 
                face of a friend.</p>
              <p> 　　She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women's 
                workroom.</p>
              <p> 　　The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very 
                skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by her day's 
                work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was earning 
                her living.</p>

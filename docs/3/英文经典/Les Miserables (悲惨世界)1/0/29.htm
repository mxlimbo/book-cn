            <td> 　　THE YEAR 1817 
              <p>　　1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance 
                which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of 
                his reign.It is the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated.All 
                the hairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the 
                royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. 
                It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as 
                church-warden in the church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, 
                in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his 
                long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has 
                performed a brilliant action.</p>
              <p>　　The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this:</p>
              <p>　　being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had 
                surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angouleme. 
                Hence his peerage.</p>
              <p>　　In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six 
                years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling 
                Esquimaux mitres.The French army was dressed in white, after the 
                mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead 
                of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at 
                St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was 
                having his old coats turned.In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle 
                Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist.</p>
              <p>　　Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso.There were still Prussians 
                in France.</p>
              <p>　　M. Delalot was a personage.Legitimacy had just asserted itself 
                by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, 
                and of Tolleron.The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and 
                the Abbe Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they 
                looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of 
                them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation 
                in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis 
                had served it in the capacity of deacon.</p>
              <p>　　In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two 
                great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain, 
                rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and 
                bees, from which the gilding was falling.</p>
              <p>　　These were the columns which two years before had upheld the 
                Emperor's platform in the Champ de Mai.They were blackened here 
                and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped 
                near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared 
                in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the 
                Imperial troops.</p>
              <p>　　The Field of May had this remarkable point:</p>
              <p>　　that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field 
                of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular:</p>
              <p>　　the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box a la Charter.The most 
                recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown 
                his brother's head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.</p>
              <p>　　They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on 
                account of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, 
                which was destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Gericault 
                with glory.Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. 
                The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop 
                for a cooper.On the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel 
                de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory 
                to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to 
                be seen.The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her 
                unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue 
                satin.</p>
              <p>　　The N's were scratched off the Louvre.</p>
              <p>　　The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the 
                bridge of the King's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, 
                which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes 
                at one stroke.</p>
              <p>　　Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with 
                the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, 
                and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two anxieties,--Napoleon 
                and Mathurin Bruneau.The French Academy had given for its prize 
                subject, The Happiness procured through Study.</p>
              <p>　　M. Bellart was officially eloquent.In his shadow could be seen 
                germinating that future advocate-general of Broe, dedicated to 
                the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier.There was a false Chateaubriand, 
                named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be a false 
                Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel were 
                masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of 
                the epoch.</p>
              <p>　　The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken 
                from its list of members.</p>
              <p>　　A royal ordinance erected Angouleme into a naval school; for 
                the Duc d'Angouleme, being lord high admiral, it was evident that 
                the city of Angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise 
                the monarchical principle would have received a wound.In the Council 
                of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes representing 
                slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi's advertising 
                posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins, should 
                be tolerated.</p>
              <p>　　M. Paer, the author of Agnese, a good sort of fellow, with 
                a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private 
                concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque. 
                All the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with 
                words by Edmond Geraud.</p>
              <p>　　The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror.</p>
              <p>　　The Cafe Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Cafe 
                Valois, which upheld the Bourbons.The Duc de Berri, already surveyed 
                from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess 
                of Sicily.</p>
              <p>　　Madame de Stael had died a year previously.</p>
              <p>　　The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars.The grand newspapers 
                were all very small.</p>
              <p>　　Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great.</p>
              <p>　　The Constitutionnel was constitutional.La Minerve called Chateaubriand 
                Chateaubriant.</p>
              <p>　　That t made the good middle-class people laugh heartily at 
                the expense of the great writer.In journals which sold themselves, 
                prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815.</p>
              <p>　　David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, 
                Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it is true 
                that Napoleon had no longer any genius.No one is ignorant of the 
                fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached 
                him, as the police made it their religious duty to intercept them.</p>
              <p>　　This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile.</p>
              <p>　　Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure 
                at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it struck 
                the royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed 
                man well on this occasion.What separated two men more than an 
                abyss was to say, the regicides, or to say the voters; to say 
                the enemies, or to say the allies; to say Napoleon, or to say 
                Buonaparte.</p>
              <p>　　All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution 
                had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed &quot;The 
                Immortal Author of the Charter.&quot;On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, 
                the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the 
                statue of Henry IV.</p>
              <p>　　M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the rough draft 
                of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy.</p>
              <p>　　The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, &quot;We 
                must write to Bacot.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　MM.</p>
              <p>　　Canuel, O'Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the 
                sketch, to some extent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to 
                become later on &quot;The Conspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau&quot;--of 
                the waterside.L'Epingle Noire was already plotting in his own 
                quarter.Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff.</p>
              <p>　　M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned.</p>
              <p>　　Chateaubriand stood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue 
                Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers, with a 
                madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed 
                on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's instruments spread out 
                before him, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, while he 
                dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, 
                his secretary.</p>
              <p>　　Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred Lafon 
                to Talma.</p>
              <p>　　M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself 
                Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert.Divorce was abolished.</p>
              <p>　　Lyceums called themselves colleges.The collegians, decorated 
                on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos 
                of the King of Rome.</p>
              <p>　　The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her Royal 
                Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the 
                Duc d'Orleans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of 
                a colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his 
                uniform of colonel-general of dragoons-- a serious inconvenience.</p>
              <p>　　The city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded 
                at its own expense.</p>
              <p>　　Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would 
                do on such or such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed 
                on divers points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry 
                was not satisfied.</p>
              <p>　　The comedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the 
                comedian Moliere had not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts 
                played at the Odeon, upon whose pediment the removal of the letters 
                still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read.</p>
              <p>　　People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot.</p>
              <p>　　Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary.The Liberal, 
                Pelicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following 
                title:</p>
              <p>　　Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy.&quot;That will attract 
                purchasers,&quot; said the ingenious editor.</p>
              <p>　　The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the 
                genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him--a sign 
                of glory; and this verse was composed on him:--</p>
              <p><br>
                　　 &quot;Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop 
                of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons.</p>
              <p>　　The quarrel over the valley of Dappes was begun between Switzerland 
                and France by a memoir from Captain, afterwards General Dufour.</p>
              <p>　　Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublime dream.</p>
              <p>　　There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whom 
                posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, 
                whom the future will recall.Lord Byron was beginning to make his 
                mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in 
                these terms:</p>
              <p>　　a certain Lord Baron.</p>
              <p>　　David d'Angers was trying to work in marble.</p>
              <p>　　The Abbe Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private 
                gathering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, 
                of an unknown priest, named Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter 
                date, became Lamennais.A thing which smoked and clattered on the 
                Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went and came beneath the 
                windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis 
                XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not good for much; 
                a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; 
                an utopia--a steamboat.</p>
              <p>　　The Parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing.</p>
              <p>　　M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coup d'etat, 
                the distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, 
                and batches of members, after having created them, could not succeed 
                in becoming one himself.The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavilion 
                de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on 
                account of his piety.Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel 
                in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened 
                each other with their fists on the subject of the divinity of 
                Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>　　Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried 
                to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with texts and 
                by making mastodons flatter Moses.</p>
              <p>　　M. Francois de Neufchateau, the praiseworthy cultivator of 
                the memory of Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme 
                de terre [potato] pronounced parmentiere, and succeeded therein 
                not at all.The Abbe Gregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, 
                had passed, in the royalist polemics, to the state of &quot;Infamous 
                Gregoire.&quot;The locution of which we have made use--passed 
                to the state of--has been condemned as a neologism by M. Royer 
                Collard.</p>
              <p>　　Under the third arch of the Pont de Jena, the new stone with 
                which, the two years previously, the mining aperture made by Blucher 
                to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was still recognizable 
                on account of its whiteness.Justice summoned to its bar a man 
                who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had said aloud:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Sapristi!</p>
              <p>　　I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter the 
                Bel Sauvage, arm in arm.&quot;A seditious utterance.</p>
              <p>　　Six months in prison.</p>
              <p>　　Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over 
                to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, 
                and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of 
                riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in

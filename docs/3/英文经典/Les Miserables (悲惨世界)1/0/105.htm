              <p> 　　NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean was not dead.</p>
              <p> 　　When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself 
                into it, he was not ironed, as we have seen.</p>
              <p> 　　He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor, to 
                which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this 
                boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached the 
                shore a little way from Cape Brun.</p>
              <p> 　　There, as he did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small 
                country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time 
                the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--a lucrative specialty. 
                Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking 
                to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued 
                an obscure and undulating itinerary.</p>
              <p> 　　He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, near Briancon, 
                in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,-- a 
                mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory 
                of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the 
                spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and 
                in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. 
                He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning 
                clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; 
                then to procure a lodging.</p>
              <p> 　　That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will 
                be remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had 
                made a mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, 
                of which the law had gathered an inkling.</p>
              <p> 　　However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further 
                increased the obscurity which had gathered about him.</p>
              <p> 　　At Paris, one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell 
                into his hands. He felt reassured and almost at peace, as though 
                he had really been dead.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette 
                from the claws of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　He re-entered it at nightfall, with the child, by way of the 
                Barrier Monceaux. There he entered a cabriolet, which took him 
                to the esplanade of the Observatoire.</p>
              <p> 　　There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the hand, 
                and together they directed their steps through the darkness,--through 
                the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere, 
                towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital.</p>
              <p> 　　The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. 
                They had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, 
                behind hedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had 
                travelled short distances on foot.</p>
              <p> 　　She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean Valjean 
                perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand 
                as she walked.</p>
              <p> 　　He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of Catherine, 
                laid her head on Jean Valjean's shoulder, and there fell asleep.

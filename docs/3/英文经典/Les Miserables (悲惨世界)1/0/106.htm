              <p> 　　MASTER GORBEAU</p>
              <p> 　　Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown 
                country of the Salpetriere, and who had mounted to the Barriere 
                d'Italie by way of the boulevard, reached a point where it might 
                be said that Paris disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was 
                not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not 
                the city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass 
                grew in them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty.</p>
              <p> 　　What was it, then?</p>
              <p> 　　It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a 
                desert place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the 
                great city, a street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, 
                more gloomy by day than a cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux.</p>
              <p> 　　The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit 
                walls of this Marche-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass 
                beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a 
                garden protected by high walls; then a field in which tan-bark 
                mills rose like gigantic beaver huts; then an enclosure encumbered 
                with timber, with a heap of stumps, sawdust, and shavings, on 
                which stood a large dog, barking; then a long, low, utterly dilapidated 
                wall, with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses, 
                which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in the most 
                deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which ran 
                the inscription in large letters:</p>
              <p> 　　POST NO BILLS,--this daring rambler would have reached little 
                known latitudes at the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. 
                There, near a factory, and between two garden walls, there could 
                be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first glance, 
                seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, 
                as large as a cathedral. It presented its side and gable to the 
                public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and 
                one window could be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　This hovel was only one story high.</p>
              <p> 　　The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door 
                could never have been anything but the door of a hovel, while 
                the window, if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead 
                of being in rough masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly 
                mansion.</p>
              <p> 　　The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks 
                roughly bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly 
                hewn logs. It opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, 
                muddy, chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width 
                as itself, which could be seen from the street, running straight 
                up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two 
                walls.</p>
              <p> 　　The top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was 
                masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular 
                hole had been sawed, which served both as wicket and air-hole 
                when the door was closed. On the inside of the door the figures 
                52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped 
                in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number 
                50, so that one hesitated. Where was one?</p>
              <p> 　　Above the door it said, &quot;Number 50&quot;; the inside 
                replied, &quot;no, Number 52.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like 
                draperies from the triangular opening.</p>
              <p> 　　The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with 
                Venetian blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only 
                these large panes were suffering from various wounds, which were 
                both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And 
                the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened passers-by rather 
                than screened the occupants.</p>
              <p> 　　The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been 
                naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that 
                what began as a blind ended as a shutter.</p>
              <p> 　　This door with an unclean, and this window with an honest 
                though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house, produced 
                the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side, with 
                different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been 
                a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.</p>
              <p> 　　The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a 
                shed which had been converted into a house.</p>
              <p> 　　This edifice had, for its intestinal tube, a long corridor, 
                on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied 
                dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances, 
                and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers received 
                their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; 
                traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the 
                door, by cold rays or by icy winds.</p>
              <p> 　　An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of 
                dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.</p>
              <p> 　　To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at 
                about the height of a man from the ground, a small window which 
                had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which 
                the children had thrown there as they passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From 
                what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it 
                was in former days.</p>
              <p> 　　As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred 
                years is youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though 
                man's lodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God's house 
                of his eternity.</p>
              <p> 　　The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known 
                in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.</p>
              <p> 　　Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, 
                and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know 
                that there was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, 
                two attorneys at the Chatelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the 
                other Renard (Fox). The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. 
                The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers; they made the most 
                of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries 
                of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:--</p>
              <p> 　　Maitre Corbeau, sur un dossier perche,[13] </p>
              <p> 　　Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire; </p>
              <p> 　　Maitre Renard, par l'odeur alleche, </p>
              <p> 　　Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire: He! bonjour.</p>
              <p> 　　Etc.</p>
              <p> 　　[13] Lawyer Corbeau, perched on a docket, held in his beak 
                a writ of execution; Lawyer Renard, attracted by the smell, addressed 
                him nearly as follows, etc.</p>
              <p> 　　The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and 
                finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts 
                of laughter which followed them, resolved to get rid of their 
                names, and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king.</p>
              <p> 　　Their petition was presented to Louis XV.</p>
              <p> 　　on the same day when the Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, and 
                the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the other, both devoutly kneeling, 
                were each engaged in putting on, in his Majesty's presence, a 
                slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who had just got 
                out of bed.</p>
              <p> 　　The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh, passed gayly 
                from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on these 
                limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so.</p>
              <p> 　　By the kings command, Maitre Corbeau was permitted to add 
                a tail to his initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maitre 
                Renard was less lucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P 
                in front of his R, and to call himself Prenard; so that the second 
                name bore almost as much resemblance as the first.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, according to local tradition, this Maitre Gorbeau had 
                been the proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard 
                de l'Hopital. He was even the author of the monumental window.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose 
                a great elm which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing 
                it opens the Rue de la Barriere des Gobelins, a street then without 
                houses, unpaved, planted with unhealthy trees, which was green 
                or muddy according to the season, and which ended squarely in 
                the exterior wall of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　An odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the 
                neighboring factory.</p>
              <p> 　　The barrier was close at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1823 the city wall was still in existence.</p>
              <p> 　　This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the road to Bicetre.</p>
              <p> 　　It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, 
                prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their 
                execution.</p>
              <p> 　　It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysterious 
                assassination, called &quot;The assassination of the Fontainebleau 
                barrier,&quot; whose authors justice was never able to discover; 
                a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a frightful 
                enigma which has never been unriddled.</p>
              <p> 　　Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, 
                where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, 
                as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the 
                abominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that 
                expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that 
                miserable and shameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois 
                society, which recoiled before the death penalty, neither daring 
                to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it with authority.</p>
              <p> 　　Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were, 
                predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the 
                most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty 
                years ago, was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, 
                where stood the building Number 50-52.</p>
              <p> 　　Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five 
                years later. The place was unpleasant.</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there, 
                one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere, a glimpse 
                of whose dome could be seen, and Bicetre, whose outskirts one 
                was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women 
                and the madness of men.</p>
              <p> 　　As far as the eye could see, one could perceive nothing but 
                the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few factories, 
                resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood hovels, 
                rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white walls 
                like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings 
                erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the 
                melancholy sadness of right angles.</p>
              <p> 　　Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in the architecture, 
                not a fold. The ensemble was glacial, regular, hideous.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.</p>
              <p> 　　It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very 
                foundation of grief.</p>
              <p> 　　Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one 
                suffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored.</p>
              <p> 　　If such a hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital 
                might have formed the entrance to it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight 
                is vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight 
                breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the 
                darkness is deep and starless, or when the moon and the wind are 
                making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, 
                this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful.</p>
              <p> 　　The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like 
                morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling 
                the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with 
                the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have 
                been committed, had something terrible about it.</p>
              <p> 　　One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that 
                darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, 
                and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between 
                each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; 
                by night it was sinister.</p>
              <p> 　　In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old 
                women seated at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. 
                These good old women were fond of begging.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than 
                an antique air, was tending even then to transformation.</p>
              <p> 　　Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had 
                to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. 
                For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has 
                stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. 
                Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital, a railway station 
                is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems as 
                though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, 
                the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient 
                dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the 
                rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous 
                horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old 
                houses crumble and new ones rise.</p>
              <p> 　　Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere, 
                the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor 
                and the Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed 
                three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres 
                and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to 
                the right and the left; for there are things which are odd when 
                said that are rigorously exact; and just as it is true to say 
                that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses 
                to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage 
                of vehicles enlarges streets.</p>
              <p> 　　The symptoms of a new life are evident. In this old provincial 
                quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself, the 
                sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even where there 
                are as yet no pedestrians.</p>
              <p> 　　One morning,--a memorable morning in July, 1845,--black pots 
                of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be said 
                that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that 
                Paris had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.</p>
            　　MASTER GORBEAU
              <p> 　　Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown 
                country of the Salpetriere, and who had mounted to the Barriere 
                d'Italie by way of the boulevard, reached a point where it might 
                be said that Paris disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was 
                not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not 
                the city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass 
                grew in them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty.</p>
              <p> 　　What was it, then?</p>
              <p> 　　It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a 
                desert place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the 
                great city, a street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, 
                more gloomy by day than a cemetery.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux.</p>
              <p> 　　The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit 
                walls of this Marche-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass 
                beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a 
                garden protected by high walls; then a field in which tan-bark 
                mills rose like gigantic beaver huts; then an enclosure encumbered 
                with timber, with a heap of stumps, sawdust, and shavings, on 
                which stood a large dog, barking; then a long, low, utterly dilapidated 
                wall, with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses, 
                which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in the most 
                deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which ran 
                the inscription in large letters:</p>
              <p> 　　POST NO BILLS,--this daring rambler would have reached little 
                known latitudes at the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. 
                There, near a factory, and between two garden walls, there could 
                be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first glance, 
                seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, 
                as large as a cathedral. It presented its side and gable to the 
                public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness.</p>
              <p> 　　Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and 
                one window could be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　This hovel was only one story high.</p>
              <p> 　　The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door 
                could never have been anything but the door of a hovel, while 
                the window, if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead 
                of being in rough masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly 
                mansion.</p>
              <p> 　　The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks 
                roughly bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly 
                hewn logs. It opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, 
                muddy, chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width 
                as itself, which could be seen from the street, running straight 
                up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two 
                walls.</p>
              <p> 　　The top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was 
                masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular 
                hole had been sawed, which served both as wicket and air-hole 
                when the door was closed. On the inside of the door the figures 
                52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped 
                in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number 
                50, so that one hesitated. Where was one?</p>
              <p> 　　Above the door it said, &quot;Number 50&quot;; the inside 
                replied, &quot;no, Number 52.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like 
                draperies from the triangular opening.</p>
              <p> 　　The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with 
                Venetian blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only 
                these large panes were suffering from various wounds, which were 
                both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And 
                the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened passers-by rather 
                than screened the occupants.</p>
              <p> 　　The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been 
                naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that 
                what began as a blind ended as a shutter.</p>
              <p> 　　This door with an unclean, and this window with an honest 
                though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house, produced 
                the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side, with 
                different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been 
                a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.</p>
              <p> 　　The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a 
                shed which had been converted into a house.</p>
              <p> 　　This edifice had, for its intestinal tube, a long corridor, 
                on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied 
                dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances, 
                and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers received 
                their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; 
                traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the 
                door, by cold rays or by icy winds.</p>
              <p> 　　An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of 
                dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.</p>
              <p> 　　To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at 
                about the height of a man from the ground, a small window which 
                had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which 
                the children had thrown there as they passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From 
                what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it 
                was in former days.</p>
              <p> 　　As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred 
                years is youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though 
                man's lodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God's house 
                of his eternity.</p>
              <p> 　　The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known 
                in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.</p>
              <p> 　　Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, 
                and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know 
                that there was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, 
                two attorneys at the Chatelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the 
                other Renard (Fox). The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. 
                The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers; they made the most 
                of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries 
                of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:--</p>
              <p> 　　Maitre Corbeau, sur un dossier perche,[13] </p>
              <p> 　　Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire; </p>
              <p> 　　Maitre Renard, par l'odeur alleche, </p>
              <p> 　　Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire: He! bonjour.</p>
              <p> 　　Etc.</p>
              <p> 　　[13] Lawyer Corbeau, perched on a docket, held in his beak 
                a writ of execution; Lawyer Renard, attracted by the smell, addressed 
                him nearly as follows, etc.</p>
              <p> 　　The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and 
                finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts 
                of laughter which followed them, resolved to get rid of their 
                names, and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king.</p>
              <p> 　　Their petition was presented to Louis XV.</p>
              <p> 　　on the same day when the Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, and 
                the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the other, both devoutly kneeling, 
                were each engaged in putting on, in his Majesty's presence, a 
                slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who had just got 
                out of bed.</p>
              <p> 　　The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh, passed gayly 
                from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on these 
                limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so.</p>
              <p> 　　By the kings command, Maitre Corbeau was permitted to add 
                a tail to his initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maitre 
                Renard was less lucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P 
                in front of his R, and to call himself Prenard; so that the second 
                name bore almost as much resemblance as the first.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, according to local tradition, this Maitre Gorbeau had 
                been the proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard 
                de l'Hopital. He was even the author of the monumental window.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.</p>
              <p> 　　Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose 
                a great elm which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing 
                it opens the Rue de la Barriere des Gobelins, a street then without 
                houses, unpaved, planted with unhealthy trees, which was green 
                or muddy according to the season, and which ended squarely in 
                the exterior wall of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　An odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the 
                neighboring factory.</p>
              <p> 　　The barrier was close at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1823 the city wall was still in existence.</p>
              <p> 　　This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the road to Bicetre.</p>
              <p> 　　It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, 
                prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their 
                execution.</p>
              <p> 　　It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysterious 
                assassination, called &quot;The assassination of the Fontainebleau 
                barrier,&quot; whose authors justice was never able to discover; 
                a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a frightful 
                enigma which has never been unriddled.</p>
              <p> 　　Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, 
                where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, 
                as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the 
                abominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that 
                expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that 
                miserable and shameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois 
                society, which recoiled before the death penalty, neither daring 
                to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it with authority.</p>
              <p> 　　Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were, 
                predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the 
                most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty 
                years ago, was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, 
                where stood the building Number 50-52.</p>
              <p> 　　Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five 
                years later. The place was unpleasant.</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there, 
                one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere, a glimpse 
                of whose dome could be seen, and Bicetre, whose outskirts one 
                was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women 
                and the madness of men.</p>
              <p> 　　As far as the eye could see, one could perceive nothing but 
                the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few factories, 
                resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood hovels, 
                rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white walls 
                like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings 
                erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the 
                melancholy sadness of right angles.</p>
              <p> 　　Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in the architecture, 
                not a fold. The ensemble was glacial, regular, hideous.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.</p>
              <p> 　　It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very 
                foundation of grief.</p>
              <p> 　　Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one 
                suffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored.</p>
              <p> 　　If such a hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital 
                might have formed the entrance to it.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight 
                is vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight 
                breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the 
                darkness is deep and starless, or when the moon and the wind are 
                making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, 
                this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful.</p>
              <p> 　　The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like 
                morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling 
                the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with 
                the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have 
                been committed, had something terrible about it.</p>
              <p> 　　One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that 
                darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, 
                and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between 
                each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; 
                by night it was sinister.</p>
              <p> 　　In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old 
                women seated at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. 
                These good old women were fond of begging.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than 
                an antique air, was tending even then to transformation.</p>
              <p> 　　Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had 
                to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. 
                For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has 
                stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. 
                Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital, a railway station 
                is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems as 
                though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, 
                the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient 
                dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the 
                rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous 
                horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old 
                houses crumble and new ones rise.</p>
              <p> 　　Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere, 
                the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor 
                and the Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed 
                three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres 
                and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to 
                the right and the left; for there are things which are odd when 
                said that are rigorously exact; and just as it is true to say 
                that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses 
                to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage 
                of vehicles enlarges streets.</p>
              <p> 　　The symptoms of a new life are evident. In this old provincial 
                quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself, the 
                sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even where there 
                are as yet no pedestrians.</p>
              <p> 　　One morning,--a memorable morning in July, 1845,--black pots 
                of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be said 
                that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that 
                Paris had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.</p>

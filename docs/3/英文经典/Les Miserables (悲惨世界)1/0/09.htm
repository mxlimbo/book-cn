              <p> 　　 The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made 
                his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, 
                and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty:</p>
              <p> 　　he had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching 
                in the line of his advancement and his interest.</p>
              <p> 　　He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man 
                by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power 
                to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, 
                having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, 
                good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid.</p>
              <p> 　　He was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think 
                himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only 
                a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly 
                over infinite and eternal things, and at the &quot;Crotchets of 
                that good old fellow the Bishop.&quot; He even sometimes laughed 
                at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel 
                himself, who listened to him.</p>
              <p> 　　On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect 
                what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with 
                the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, 
                though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.</p>
              <p> 　　It is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other 
                without winking.</p>
              <p> 　　We are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you.</p>
              <p> 　　I have a philosophy of my own.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And you are right,&quot; replied the Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.</p>
              <p> 　　You are on the bed of purple, senator.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The senator was encouraged, and went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us be good fellows.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good devils even,&quot; said the Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I declare to you,&quot; continued the senator, &quot;that 
                the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. 
                I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Like yourself, Count,&quot; interposed the Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　The senator resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and 
                a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted 
                than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, 
                for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.</p>
              <p> 　　A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the 
                fiat lux.</p>
              <p> 　　Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you 
                have the world.</p>
              <p> 　　Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?</p>
              <p> 　　The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose 
                reasoning is hollow.</p>
              <p> 　　Down with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero 
                which leaves me in peace!</p>
              <p> 　　Between you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make 
                confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit 
                to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your 
                Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity.</p>
              <p> 　　'Tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars.</p>
              <p> 　　Renunciation; why?</p>
              <p> 　　Sacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself 
                for the happiness of another wolf.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us stick to nature, then.</p>
              <p> 　　We are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　What is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no 
                further than the end of other people's noses?</p>
              <p> 　　Let us live merrily.</p>
              <p> 　　Life is all.</p>
              <p> 　　That man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, 
                I don't believe; not one single word of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must 
                take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good 
                and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because I shall have to render an account of my actions.</p>
              <p> 　　When?</p>
              <p> 　　After death.</p>
              <p> 　　What a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever 
                person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, 
                if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who 
                have raised the veil of Isis:</p>
              <p> 　　there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us seek the real.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us get to the bottom of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us go into it thoroughly.</p>
              <p> 　　What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it!</p>
              <p> 　　We must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and 
                seize it.</p>
              <p> 　　Then it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and 
                you laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　I am square on the bottom, I am.</p>
              <p> 　　Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's 
                shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What 
                a fine lot Adam has!</p>
              <p> 　　We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our 
                shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian 
                who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star?</p>
              <p> 　　Very well.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, 
                we shall see God.</p>
              <p> 　　Ta, ta, ta!</p>
              <p> 　　What twaddle all these paradises are!</p>
              <p> 　　God is a nonsensical monster.</p>
              <p> 　　I would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper 
                it among friends. Inter pocula.</p>
              <p> 　　To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey 
                for the shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　Be the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool.</p>
              <p> 　　I am a nought.</p>
              <p> 　　I call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.</p>
              <p> 　　Did I exist before my birth?</p>
              <p> 　　No. Shall I exist after death?</p>
              <p> 　　No. What am I?</p>
              <p> 　　A little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on 
                this earth?</p>
              <p> 　　The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.</p>
              <p> 　　Whither will suffering lead me?</p>
              <p> 　　To nothingness; but I shall have suffered.</p>
              <p> 　　Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall 
                have enjoyed myself.</p>
              <p> 　　My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten.</p>
              <p> 　　I shall eat.</p>
              <p> 　　It is better to be the tooth than the grass.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is my wisdom.</p>
              <p> 　　After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; 
                the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole.</p>
              <p> 　　End.</p>
              <p> 　　Finis.</p>
              <p> 　　Total liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, 
                believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has 
                anything to tell me on that subject.</p>
              <p> 　　Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men.</p>
              <p> 　　No; our to-morrow is the night.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness.</p>
              <p> 　　You have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it 
                makes no difference.</p>
              <p> 　　That is the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　Then live your life, above all things.</p>
              <p> 　　Make use of your _I_ while you have it.</p>
              <p> 　　In truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my 
                own, and I have my philosophers.</p>
              <p> 　　I don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.</p>
              <p> 　　Of course, there must be something for those who are down,--for 
                the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches.</p>
              <p> 　　Legends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, 
                are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down.</p>
              <p> 　　They spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else 
                has the good.</p>
              <p> 　　God.</p>
              <p> 　　That is the least he can have.</p>
              <p> 　　I oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon 
                for myself.</p>
              <p> 　　The good God is good for the populace.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Bishop clapped his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's talking!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this 
                materialism!</p>
              <p> 　　Not every one who wants it can have it.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does 
                not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned 
                like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have 
                succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy 
                of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they 
                can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, 
                dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, 
                useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that 
                they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished.</p>
              <p> 　　How agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to 
                you, senator.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating 
                you.</p>
              <p> 　　You great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, 
                and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to 
                the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness 
                of life admirably.</p>
              <p> 　　This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed 
                by special seekers.</p>
              <p> 　　But you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it 
                a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the 
                philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with 
                chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.&quot;</p>

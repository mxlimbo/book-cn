              <p> 　　LITTLE GERVAIS</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from 
                it. He set out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking 
                whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him, without 
                perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps.</p>
              <p> 　　He wandered thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything 
                and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng of novel 
                sensations.</p>
              <p> 　　He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not know against 
                whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was touched 
                or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotion 
                which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired 
                during the last twenty years of his life.</p>
              <p> 　　This state of mind fatigued him.</p>
              <p> 　　He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which 
                the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving 
                way within him. He asked himself what would replace this.</p>
              <p> 　　At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison 
                with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in 
                this way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season 
                was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few late flowers 
                in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed through 
                them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood.</p>
              <p> 　　These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long 
                since they had recurred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all 
                day long.</p>
              <p> 　　As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart 
                the soil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush 
                upon a large ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing on the horizon except the Alps.</p>
              <p> 　　Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean Valjean might 
                have been three leagues distant from D---- A path which intersected 
                the plain passed a few paces from the bush.</p>
              <p> 　　In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed 
                not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might 
                have encountered him, a joyous sound became audible.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years 
                of age, coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his 
                hip, and his marmot-box on his back,</p>
              <p> 　　One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to 
                land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their 
                trousers.</p>
              <p> 　　Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from 
                time to time, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which 
                he had in his hand--his whole fortune, probably.</p>
              <p> 　　Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.</p>
              <p> 　　The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean 
                Valjean, and tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that 
                time, he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back 
                of his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling 
                towards the brushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had 
                caught sight of him.</p>
              <p> 　　He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.</p>
              <p> 　　The spot was absolutely solitary.</p>
              <p> 　　As far as the eye could see there was not a person on the 
                plain or on the path.</p>
              <p> 　　The only sound was the tiny, feeble cries of a flock of birds 
                of passage, which was traversing the heavens at an immense height.</p>
              <p> 　　The child was standing with his back to the sun, which cast 
                threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood-red gleam 
                the savage face of Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir,&quot; said the little Savoyard, with that childish 
                confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence, &quot;my 
                money.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your name?&quot; said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Little Gervais, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go away,&quot; said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir,&quot; resumed the child, &quot;give me back my 
                money.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　The child began again, &quot;My money, sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My piece of money!&quot; cried the child, &quot;my white 
                piece! my silver!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him.</p>
              <p> 　　The child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron-shod 
                shoe which rested on his treasure.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The child wept.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean raised his head.</p>
              <p> 　　He still remained seated.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were troubled.</p>
              <p> 　　He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement, then he stretched 
                out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice, 
                &quot;Who's there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I, sir,&quot; replied the child.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Little Gervais!</p>
              <p> 　　I!</p>
              <p> 　　Give me back my forty sous, if you please!</p>
              <p> 　　Take your foot away, sir, if you please!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost 
                menacing:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come now, will you take your foot away?</p>
              <p> 　　Take your foot away, or we'll see!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　It's still you!&quot; said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly 
                to his feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you take yourself off!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble 
                from head to foot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, 
                running at the top of his speed, without daring to turn his neck 
                or to utter a cry.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain 
                distance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of 
                his own revery.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had set.</p>
              <p> 　　The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He had eaten nothing all day; it is probable that he was feverish.</p>
              <p> 　　He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude 
                after the child's flight.</p>
              <p> 　　The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals.</p>
              <p> 　　His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed 
                to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient 
                fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All 
                at once he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.</p>
              <p> 　　He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically 
                to cross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to 
                pick up his cudgel.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which 
                his foot had half ground into the earth, and which was shining 
                among the pebbles.</p>
              <p> 　　It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. &quot;What 
                is this?&quot; he muttered between his teeth.</p>
              <p> 　　He recoiled three paces, then halted, without being able to 
                detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an 
                instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering there 
                in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively 
                towards the silver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up 
                again and began to gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time 
                casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon, as he stood 
                there erect and shivering, like a terrified wild animal which 
                is seeking refuge.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great banks 
                of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.</p>
              <p> 　　He said, &quot;Ah!&quot; and set out rapidly in the direction 
                in which the child had disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him and saw 
                nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he shouted with all his might:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Little Gervais!</p>
              <p> 　　Little Gervais!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused and waited.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　The landscape was gloomy and deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　He was encompassed by space. There was nothing around him 
                but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and a silence which 
                engulfed his voice.</p>
              <p> 　　An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around 
                him a sort of lugubrious life.</p>
              <p> 　　The bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that they were threatening and pursuing 
                some one.</p>
              <p> 　　He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from 
                time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a 
                voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate 
                that it was possible to hear, &quot;Little Gervais!</p>
              <p> 　　Little Gervais!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been 
                alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself.</p>
              <p> 　　But the child was no doubt already far away.</p>
              <p> 　　He encountered a priest on horseback.</p>
              <p> 　　He stepped up to him and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; said the priest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One named Little Gervais?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have seen no one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed 
                them to the priest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Cure, this is for your poor people.</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur le Cure, he was a little lad, about ten years old, 
                with a marmot, I think, and a hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, 
                you know?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have not seen him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Little Gervais?</p>
              <p> 　　There are no villages here?</p>
              <p> 　　Can you tell me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little 
                stranger. Such persons pass through these parts.</p>
              <p> 　　We know nothing of them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with 
                violence, and gave them to the priest.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For your poor,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he added, wildly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested.</p>
              <p> 　　I am a thief.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much 
                alarmed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had 
                first taken.</p>
              <p> 　　In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, 
                calling, shouting, but he met no one.</p>
              <p> 　　Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something 
                which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or 
                crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks 
                nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where three 
                paths intersected each other, he stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　The moon had risen.</p>
              <p> 　　He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last 
                time, &quot;Little Gervais!</p>
              <p> 　　Little Gervais! Little Gervais!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening an 
                echo.</p>
              <p> 　　He murmured yet once more, &quot;Little Gervais!&quot; but 
                in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice.</p>
              <p> 　　It was his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, 
                as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with 
                the weight of his evil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large 
                stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees, 
                and he cried, &quot;I am a wretch!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then his heart burst, and he began to cry.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years.</p>
              <p> 　　When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have 
                seen, quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought 
                hitherto. He could not yield to the evidence of what was going 
                on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action 
                and the gentle words of the old man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy 
                your soul.</p>
              <p> 　　I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to 
                the good God.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This recurred to his mind unceasingly.</p>
              <p> 　　To this celestial kindness he opposed pride, which is the 
                fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly conscious that 
                the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most 
                formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was 
                finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, 
                he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions 
                of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which 
                pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to 
                be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, 
                had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who 
                is intoxicated.</p>
              <p> 　　As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct 
                perception of what might result to him from his adventure at D----? 
                Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune 
                the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in 
                his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; 
                that there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if 
                he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; 
                that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the 
                Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become 
                good be must become an angel; that if he wished to remain evil, 
                he must become a monster?</p>
              <p> 　　Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already 
                put to ourselves elsewhere:</p>
              <p> 　　did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a 
                confused way?</p>
              <p> 　　Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form the education 
                of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether Jean 
                Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here 
                indicated.</p>
              <p> 　　If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, 
                rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him 
                into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion.</p>
              <p> 　　On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called 
                the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light 
                would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　The future life, the possible life which offered itself to 
                him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors 
                and anxiety.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer knew where he really was.</p>
              <p> 　　Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict 
                had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that 
                he was no longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, 
                that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop 
                had not spoken to him and had not touched him.</p>
              <p> 　　In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and 
                had robbed him of his forty sous.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　He certainly could not have explained it; was this the last 
                effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts 
                which he had brought away from the galleys,-- a remnant of impulse, 
                a result of what is called in statics, acquired force?</p>
              <p> 　　It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us say it simply, it was not he who stole; it was not 
                the man; it was the beast, who, by habit and instinct, had simply 
                placed his foot upon that money, while the intelligence was struggling 
                amid so many novel and hitherto unheard-of thoughts besetting 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　When intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the 
                brute, Jean Valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of 
                terror.</p>
              <p> 　　It was because,--strange phenomenon, and one which was possible 
                only in the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing 
                the money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was 
                no longer capable.</p>
              <p> 　　However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive 
                effect on him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore 
                in his mind, and dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, 
                and on the other the light, and acted on his soul, in the state 
                in which it then was, as certain chemical reagents act upon a 
                troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the 
                other.</p>
              <p> 　　First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, 
                all bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to 
                find the child in order to return his money to him; then, when 
                he recognized the fact that this was impossible, he halted in 
                despair. At the moment when he exclaimed &quot;I am a wretch!&quot; 
                he had just perceived what he was, and he was already separated 
                from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be 
                no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had, there 
                before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean 
                Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack 
                filled with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and 
                gloomy visage, with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.</p>
              <p> 　　Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in 
                some sort a visionary.</p>
              <p> 　　This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw 
                that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost 
                reached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was 
                horrified by him.</p>
              <p> 　　His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly 
                calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality. 
                One no longer beholds the object which one has before one, and 
                one sees, as though apart from one's self, the figures which one 
                has in one's own mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and 
                at the same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in 
                a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for 
                a torch.</p>
              <p> 　　On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience 
                with more attention, he recognized the fact that it possessed 
                a human form and that this torch was the Bishop.</p>
              <p> 　　His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before 
                it,-- the Bishop and Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing less than the first was required to soften the second.</p>
              <p> 　　By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar to this 
                sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as the 
                Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean 
                grow less and vanish.</p>
              <p> 　　After a certain time he was no longer anything more than a 
                shade.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he 
                filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent 
                radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean wept for a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　He wept burning tears, he sobbed with more weakness than a 
                woman, with more fright than a child.</p>
              <p> 　　As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into 
                his soul; an extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and 
                terrible. His past life, his first fault, his long expiation, 
                his external brutishness, his internal hardness, his dismissal 
                to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, what had 
                happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thing that he had done, 
                that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, 
                and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop's 
                pardon,--all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to 
                him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed.</p>
              <p> 　　He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, 
                and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light 
                rested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he 
                beheld Satan by the light of Paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　How many hours did he weep thus?</p>
              <p> 　　What did he do after he had wept? Whither did he go!</p>
              <p> 　　No one ever knew.</p>
              <p> 　　The only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that 
                same night the carrier who served Grenoble at that epoch, and 
                who arrived at D---- about three o'clock in the morning, saw, 
                as he traversed the street in which the Bishop's residence was 
                situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement 
                in the shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome. </p>

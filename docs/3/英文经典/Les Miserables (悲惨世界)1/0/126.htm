              <p> 　　THE LITTLE CONVENT</p>
              <p> 　　In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly 
                distinct buildings,--the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, 
                the Boarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, 
                what was called the Little Convent.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a building with a garden, in which lived all sorts 
                of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters destroyed 
                in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and white 
                medleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might 
                be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort 
                of harlequin convent.</p>
              <p> 　　When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed 
                and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take 
                shelter under the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government 
                paid them a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received 
                them cordially.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule, Sometimes 
                the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, 
                to pay them a visit; the result is, that all those young memories 
                have retained among other souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, 
                Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.</p>
              <p> 　　One of these refugees found herself almost at home.</p>
              <p> 　　She was a nun of Sainte-Aure, the only one of her order who 
                had survived. The ancient convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure 
                occupied, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, this very 
                house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged later to the Benedictines 
                of Martin Verga.</p>
              <p> 　　This holy woman, too poor to wear the magnificent habit of 
                her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary, had 
                piously put it on a little manikin, which she exhibited with complacency 
                and which she bequeathed to the house at her death. In 1824, only 
                one nun of this order remained; to-day, there remains only a doll.</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women 
                had obtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, 
                to retire into the Little Convent.</p>
              <p> 　　Among the number were Madame Beaufort d'Hautpoul and Marquise 
                Dufresne.</p>
              <p> 　　Another was never known in the convent except by the formidable 
                noise which she made when she blew her nose.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).</p>
              <p> 　　About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time 
                editing a little periodical publication called l'Intrepide, asked 
                to be allowed to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady 
                resident. The Duc d'Orleans recommended her.</p>
              <p> 　　Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were all in a flutter; 
                Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared that she 
                was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her fierce 
                stage of devotion.</p>
              <p> 　　With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she entered.</p>
              <p> 　　She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as 
                a reason, that there was no shade in the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　The nuns were delighted.</p>
              <p> 　　Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very 
                well.</p>
              <p> 　　When she went away she left her mark in her cell.</p>
              <p> 　　Madame de Genlis was superstitious and a Latinist.</p>
              <p> 　　These two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her.</p>
              <p>A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in the inside 
                of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware 
                and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her own 
                hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion, possessed 
                the property of frightening away robbers:--</p>
              <p> 　　Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:[15] </p>
              <p> 　　Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas; </p>
              <p> 　　Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas; </p>
              <p> 　　Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas. </p>
              <p> 　　Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.</p>
              <p> 　　[15] On the boughs hang three bodies of unequal merits: Dismas 
                and Gesmas, between is the divine power.</p>
              <p> 　　Dismas seeks the heights, Gesmas, unhappy man, the lowest 
                regions; the highest power will preserve us and our effects.</p>
              <p> 　　If you repeat this verse, you will not lose your things by 
                theft.</p>
              <p> 　　These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether 
                the two thieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, 
                Dismas and Gestas, or Dismas and Gesmas.</p>
              <p> 　　This orthography might have confounded the pretensions put 
                forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of a descent 
                from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached to 
                these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.</p>
              <p> 　　The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to 
                separate the Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable 
                intrenchment, was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the 
                Great Convent, and the Little Convent.</p>
              <p> 　　The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance 
                on the street.</p>
              <p> 　　But all was so arranged, that none of the inhabitants of the 
                cloister could see a face from the outside world.</p>
              <p> 　　Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, 
                and folded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, 
                a prolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure 
                cellar, to the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall 
                to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height, of which we 
                have already spoken; in the shadow of that curtain, pile up on 
                wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left, the school-girls 
                on the right, the lay-sisters and the novices at <br>
                the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus 
                assisting at divine service.</p>
              <p> 　　That cavern, which was called the choir, communicated with 
                the cloister by a lobby.</p>
              <p> 　　The church was lighted from the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　When the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined 
                silence, the public was warned of their presence only by the folding 
                seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.</p>

              <p> 　　 The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but 
                the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse.</p>
              <p> 　　Who were these Thenardiers?</p>
              <p> 　　Let us say a word or two of them now.</p>
              <p> 　　We will complete the sketch later on.</p>
              <p> 　　These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse 
                people who have been successful, and of intelligent people who 
                have descended in the scale, which is between the class called 
                &quot;middle&quot; and the class denominated as &quot;inferior,&quot; 
                and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly 
                all the vices of the first, without possessing the generous impulse 
                of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances 
                to warm them up, easily become monstrous.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in the woman a substratum of the brute, and in the 
                man the material for a blackguard. Both were susceptible, in the 
                highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished 
                in the direction of evil.</p>
              <p> 　　There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating 
                towards the darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing, 
                employing experience to augment their deformity, growing incessantly 
                worse, and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting 
                blackness. This man and woman possessed such souls.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. 
                One can only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels 
                that they are dark in both directions.</p>
              <p> 　　They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front.</p>
              <p> 　　There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more 
                answer for what they have done than for what they will do.</p>
              <p> 　　The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. 
                From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, 
                one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre 
                mysteries in their future.</p>
              <p> 　　This Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been 
                a soldier-- a sergeant, he said.</p>
              <p> 　　He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, and had 
                even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We 
                shall see later on how much truth there was in this.</p>
              <p> 　　The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats 
                of arms. He had painted it himself; for he knew how to do a little 
                of everything, and badly.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, 
                after having been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, 
                still noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from 
                Mademoiselle de Scuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame 
                de Lafayette to Madame Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving 
                hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the 
                suburbs to some extent. Madame Thenardier was just intelligent 
                enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them.</p>
              <p> 　　In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given 
                her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive 
                attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian 
                lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one 
                and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, 
                given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and &quot;in what concerns 
                the sex,&quot; as he said in his jargon--a downright, unmitigated 
                lout.</p>
              <p> 　　His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping 
                fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magaera began to be developed 
                from the Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse, 
                vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was 
                that her eldest daughter was named Eponine; as for the younger, 
                the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know not 
                to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she 
                owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.</p>
              <p> 　　However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous 
                and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, 
                and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. 
                By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated 
                there is the social symptom.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the 
                name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there 
                are still any vicomtes--to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques.</p>
              <p> 　　This displacement, which places the &quot;elegant&quot; name 
                on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing 
                else than an eddy of equality.</p>
              <p> 　　The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there 
                as everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great 
                and a profound thing,-- the French Revolution.</p>

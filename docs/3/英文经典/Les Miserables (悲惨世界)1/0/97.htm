              <p> 　　MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER</p>
              <p> 　　 Four new travellers had arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight 
                years old, she had already suffered so much that she reflected 
                with the lugubrious air of an old woman.</p>
              <p> 　　Her eye was black in consequence of a blow from Madame Thenardier's 
                fist, which caused the latter to remark from time to time, &quot;How 
                ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the 
                pitchers and caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had 
                arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water 
                in the cistern.</p>
              <p> 　　She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thenardier 
                establishment drank much water.</p>
              <p> 　　Thirsty people were never lacking there; but their thirst 
                was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those 
                glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men.</p>
              <p> 　　But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thenardier 
                raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, 
                then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned 
                the faucet; the child had raised her head and was following all 
                the woman's movements.</p>
              <p> 　　A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half 
                filled the glass.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;there is no more water!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A momentary silence ensued.</p>
              <p> 　　The child did not breathe.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!&quot; resumed Madame Thenardier, examining the 
                half-filled glass, &quot;this will be enough.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter 
                of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big 
                snow-flake.</p>
              <p> 　　She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished 
                it were the next morning.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, 
                and exclaimed, &quot;It's as black as an oven!&quot; or, &quot;One 
                must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern 
                at this hour!&quot; And Cosette trembled.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry 
                entered, and said in a harsh voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My horse has not been watered.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, it has,&quot; said Madame Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I tell you that it has not,&quot; retorted the pedler.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had emerged from under the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh, yes, sir!&quot; said she, &quot;the horse has had 
                a drink; he drank out of a bucket, a whole bucketful, and it was 
                I who took the water to him, and I spoke to him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was not true; Cosette lied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big 
                as the house,&quot; exclaimed the pedler.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I tell you that he has not been watered, you little 
                jade!</p>
              <p> 　　He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which I 
                know well.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with 
                anguish, and which was hardly audible:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And he drank heartily.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come,&quot; said the pedler, in a rage, &quot;this won't 
                do at all, let my horse be watered, and let that be the end of 
                it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette crept under the table again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In truth, that is fair!&quot; said Madame Thenardier, 
                &quot;if the beast has not been watered, it must be.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then glancing about her:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, now!</p>
              <p> 　　Where's that other beast?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other 
                end of the table, almost under the drinkers' feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you coming?&quot; shrieked Madame Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden 
                herself. The Thenardier resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But, Madame,&quot; said Cosette, feebly, &quot;there 
                is no water.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier threw the street door wide open:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, go and get some, then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which 
                stood near the chimney-corner.</p>
              <p> 　　This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have 
                set down in it at her ease.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was 
                in the stewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's plenty in the spring.</p>
              <p> 　　There never was such a malicious creature as that.</p>
              <p> 　　I think I should have done better to strain my onions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, 
                and shallots.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;See here, Mam'selle Toad,&quot; she added, &quot;on 
                your way back, you will get a big loaf from the baker.</p>
              <p> 　　Here's a fifteen-sou piece.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she 
                took the coin without saying a word, and put it in that pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before 
                her. She seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get along with you!&quot; screamed the Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette went out.</p>
              <p> 　　The door closed behind her.</p>

              <p> 　　THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER</p>
              <p> 　　 With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided 
                that they are sincere.</p>
              <p> 　　Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.</p>
              <p> 　　There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. 
                There is also a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies 
                the sun; this philosophy is called blindness.</p>
              <p> 　　To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is 
                a fine blind man's self-sufficiency.</p>
              <p> 　　The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate 
                airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy 
                which beholds God.</p>
              <p> 　　One fancies he hears a mole crying, &quot;I pity them with 
                their sun!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists.</p>
              <p> 　　At bottom, led back to the truth by their very force, they 
                are not absolutely sure that they are atheists; it is with them 
                only a question of definition, and in any case, if they do not 
                believe in God, being great minds, they prove God.</p>
              <p> 　　We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing 
                their philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us go on.</p>
              <p> 　　The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in 
                paying themselves off with words.</p>
              <p> 　　A metaphysical school of the North, impregnated to some extent 
                with fog, has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human 
                understanding by replacing the word Force with the word Will.</p>
              <p> 　　To say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;the plant wills,&quot; instead of:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;the plant grows&quot;: this would be fecund in results, 
                indeed, if we were to add: &quot;the universe wills.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore 
                it has an _I_; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.</p>
              <p> 　　As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, 
                reject nothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this 
                school, appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the 
                universe denied by it.</p>
              <p> 　　To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is 
                impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite.</p>
              <p> 　　We have demonstrated this.</p>
              <p> 　　The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything 
                becomes &quot;a mental conception.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist 
                logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite 
                sure that it exists itself.</p>
              <p> 　　From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for 
                itself, only &quot;a mental conception.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it 
                admits in the lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which 
                makes all end in the monosyllable, No.</p>
              <p> 　　To No there is only one reply, Yes.</p>
              <p> 　　Nihilism has no point.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no such thing as nothingness.</p>
              <p> 　　Zero does not exist. Everything is something.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.</p>
              <p> 　　Even to see and to show does not suffice.</p>
              <p> 　　Philosophy should be an energy; it should have for effort 
                and effect to ameliorate the condition of man.</p>
              <p> 　　Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; 
                in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from 
                the man of felicity.</p>
              <p> 　　Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be a 
                cordial.</p>
              <p> 　　To enjoy,--what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition!</p>
              <p> 　　The brute enjoys.</p>
              <p> 　　To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as 
                an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize 
                in them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; 
                such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming 
                out of truths.</p>
              <p> 　　Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable.</p>
              <p> 　　It is necessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, 
                and eatable to the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right 
                to say:</p>
              <p> 　　Take, this is my body, this is my blood.</p>
              <p> 　　Wisdom is a holy communion. It is on this condition that it 
                ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and 
                sovereign mode of human rallying, and that philosophy herself 
                is promoted to religion.</p>
              <p> 　　Philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze 
                upon it at its ease, without any other result than that of being 
                convenient to curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to 
                another occasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we 
                neither understand man as a point of departure nor progress as 
                an end, without those two forces which are their two motors:</p>
              <p> 　　faith and love.</p>
              <p> 　　Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.</p>
              <p> 　　What is this ideal?</p>
              <p> 　　It is God.</p>
              <p> 　　Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity:</p>
              <p> 　　identical words.</p>

              <p> 　　AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR</p>
              <p> 　　Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur 
                M. enjoyed a sort of celebrity.</p>
              <p> 　　For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had 
                filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed the 
                confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through 
                two or three neighboring departments.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town 
                by resuscitating the black jet industry, there was not one out 
                of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M. 
                sur M. which was not indebted to him for some benefit.</p>
              <p> 　　He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries 
                of other arrondissements.</p>
              <p> 　　It was thus that he had, when occasion offered, supported 
                with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne, the 
                flax-spinning industry at Frevent, and the hydraulic manufacture 
                of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine 
                was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai envied the happy 
                little town of M. sur M. its mayor.</p>
              <p> 　　The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding 
                over this session of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in 
                common with the rest of the world, with this name which was so 
                profoundly and universally honored.</p>
              <p> 　　When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected 
                the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of 
                the President's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was 
                inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The gentleman desires to be present at the trial,&quot; 
                the President, with a quick and deferential movement, seized a 
                pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned 
                it to the usher, saying, &quot;Admit him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained 
                near the door of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude 
                in which the usher had left him.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him, 
                &quot;Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?&quot; It was 
                the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously, 
                and who was now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, 
                the usher handed him the paper.</p>
              <p> 　　He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light, he 
                could read it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects 
                to M. Madeleine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained 
                for him a strange and bitter aftertaste.</p>
              <p> 　　He followed the usher.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted 
                cabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon 
                a table with a green cloth.</p>
              <p> 　　The last words of the usher who had just quitted him still 
                rang in his ears:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; you have 
                only to turn the copper handle of yonder door, and you will find 
                yourself in the court-room, behind the President's chair.&quot; 
                These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of 
                narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed.</p>
              <p> 　　The usher had left him alone.</p>
              <p> 　　The supreme moment had arrived. He sought to collect his faculties, 
                but could not.</p>
              <p> 　　It is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need 
                for attaching them to the painful realities of life, that the 
                threads of thought snap within the brain.</p>
              <p> 　　He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and 
                condemned.</p>
              <p> 　　With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible 
                apartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon 
                to ring with his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing.</p>
              <p> 　　He stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering 
                that it should be that chamber and that it should be he.</p>
              <p> 　　He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn 
                out by the jolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. 
                It seemed to him that he felt nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, 
                and which contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter 
                of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, 
                through an error, no doubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., 
                and in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers 
                and deputies held in arrest by them.</p>
              <p> 　　Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and 
                who had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this 
                letter struck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes 
                from it, and he read it two or three times. He read it without 
                paying any attention to it, and unconsciously. He was thinking 
                of Fantine and Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the 
                brass knob of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. 
                He had almost forgotten that door.</p>
              <p> 　　His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained fixed on 
                that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by little became 
                impregnated with fear.</p>
              <p> 　　Beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled 
                down upon his temples.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of 
                a sort of authority mingled with rebellion, which is intended 
                to convey, and which does so well convey, &quot;Pardieu! who compels 
                me to this?&quot; Then he wheeled briskly round, caught sight 
                of the door through which he had entered in front of him, went 
                to it, opened it, and passed out. He was no longer in that chamber; 
                he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor, broken 
                by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lighted here 
                and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, 
                the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he 
                listened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he 
                fled as though pursued.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still 
                listened. The same silence reigned, and there was the same darkness 
                around him. He was out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against 
                the wall. The stone was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on 
                his brow; he straightened himself up with a shiver.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and 
                with something else, too, perchance, he meditated.</p>
              <p> 　　He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the 
                day: he heard within him but one voice, which said, &quot;Alas!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A quarter of an hour passed thus.</p>
              <p> 　　At length he bowed his head, sighed with agony, dropped his 
                arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly, and as though 
                crushed.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight 
                and was leading him back.</p>
              <p> 　　He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught 
                sight of was the knob of the door.</p>
              <p> 　　This knob, which was round and of polished brass, shone like 
                a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into 
                the eye of a tiger.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not take his eyes from it.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time he advanced a step and approached the door.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining 
                hall like a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and 
                he did not hear.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found 
                himself near the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door 
                opened.</p>
              <p> 　　He was in the court-room.</p>

              <p>　　A MERRY END TO MIRTH</p>
              <p>　　When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two 
                on the window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking 
                from one window to the other.</p>
              <p>　　They saw the young men emerge from the Cafe Bombarda arm in 
                arm.The latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared 
                in that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into 
                the Champs-Elysees.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Don't be long!&quot; cried Fantine.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;What are they going to bring us?&quot; said Zephine.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It will certainly be something pretty,&quot; said Dahlia.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;For my part,&quot; said Favourite, &quot;I want it to 
                be of gold.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the 
                shore of the lake, which they could see through the branches of 
                the large trees, and which diverted them greatly.</p>
              <p>　　It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.Nearly 
                all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the 
                Champs-Elysees. The majority followed the quay and went through 
                the Passy Barrier.</p>
              <p>　　From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and 
                black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by 
                trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately 
                disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a 
                forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, 
                changing all the paving-stones into steels.This uproar delighted 
                the young girls.</p>
              <p>　　Favourite exclaimed:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;What a row!</p>
              <p>　　One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only 
                see with difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, 
                then set out again at a gallop.</p>
              <p>　　This surprised Fantine.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;That's odd!&quot; said she.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I thought the diligence never stopped.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Favourite shrugged her shoulders.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;This Fantine is surprising.</p>
              <p>　　I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity.</p>
              <p>　　She is dazzled by the simplest things.</p>
              <p>　　Suppose a case:I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, `I 
                will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you 
                pass.'</p>
              <p>　　The diligence passes, sees me, halts, and takes me.</p>
              <p>　　That is done every day.</p>
              <p>　　You do not know life, my dear.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　In this manner a certain time elapsed.</p>
              <p>　　All at once Favourite made a movement, like a person who is 
                just waking up.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;and the surprise?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, by the way,&quot; joined in Dahlia, &quot;the famous 
                surprise?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;They are a very long time about it!&quot; said Fantine.</p>
              <p>　　As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them 
                at dinner entered.</p>
              <p>　　He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;What is that?&quot; demanded Favourite.</p>
              <p>　　The waiter replied:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Why did you not bring it at once?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Because,&quot; said the waiter, &quot;the gentlemen ordered 
                me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand.</p>
              <p>　　It was, in fact, a letter.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Stop!&quot; said she; &quot;there is no address; but 
                this is what is written on it--&quot;</p>
              <p>　　 &quot;THIS IS THE SURPRISE.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she 
                knew how to read]:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;OUR BELOVED:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;You must know that we have parents.</p>
              <p>　　Parents--you do not know much about such things.</p>
              <p>　　They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code, which 
                is puerile and honest.</p>
              <p>　　Now, these parents groan, these old folks implore us, these 
                good men and these good women call us prodigal sons; they desire 
                our return, and offer to kill calves for us.Being virtuous, we 
                obey them.</p>
              <p>　　At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will be bearing 
                us to our papas and mammas.</p>
              <p>　　We are pulling up our stakes, as Bossuet says.</p>
              <p>　　We are going; we are gone.We flee in the arms of Lafitte and 
                on the wings of Caillard.The Toulouse diligence tears us from 
                the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties!</p>
              <p>　　We return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, 
                at the rate of three leagues an hour.It is necessary for the good 
                of the country that we should be, like the rest of the world, 
                prefects, fathers of families, rural police, and councillors of 
                state.</p>
              <p>　　Venerate us.</p>
              <p>　　We are sacrificing ourselves.Mourn for us in haste, and replace 
                us with speed.</p>
              <p>　　If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it.</p>
              <p>　　Adieu.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy.We 
                bear you no grudge for that. &quot;Signed: BLACHEVELLE. FAMUEIL. 
                LISTOLIER. FELIX THOLOMYES.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Postscriptum.</p>
              <p>　　The dinner is paid for.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The four young women looked at each other.</p>
              <p>　　Favourite was the first to break the silence.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Well!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;it's a very pretty farce, 
                all the same.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is very droll,&quot; said Zephine.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;That must have been Blachevelle's idea,&quot; resumed 
                Favourite.&quot;It makes me in love with him.</p>
              <p>　　No sooner is he gone than he is loved.This is an adventure, 
                indeed.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Dahlia; &quot;it was one of Tholomyes' 
                ideas.</p>
              <p>　　That is evident.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;In that case,&quot; retorted Favourite, &quot;death to 
                Blachevelle, and long live Tholomyes!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Long live Tholomyes!&quot; exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine.</p>
              <p>　　And they burst out laughing.</p>
              <p>　　Fantine laughed with the rest.</p>
              <p>　　An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept.It 
                was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself 
                to this Tholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.

                Blachevelle, and long live Tholomyes!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Long live Tholomyes!&quot; exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine.</p>
              <p>　　And they burst out laughing.</p>
              <p>　　Fantine laughed with the rest.</p>
              <p>　　An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept.It 
                was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself 
                to this Tholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.

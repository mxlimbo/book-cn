              <p> 　　SISTER SIMPLICE </p>
              <p> 　　The incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known 
                at M. sur M. But the small portion of them which became known 
                left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist 
                in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details. 
                Among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable 
                circumstances, which we preserve out of respect for the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine 
                went to see Fantine according to his wont.</p>
              <p> 　　Before entering Fantine's room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.</p>
              <p> 　　The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary, 
                Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names 
                of Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice.</p>
              <p> 　　Sister Perpetue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity 
                in a coarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters 
                any other service.</p>
              <p> 　　She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not so 
                very rare.</p>
              <p> 　　The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware, 
                which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.</p>
              <p> 　　These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion.</p>
              <p> 　　The transition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the 
                least violent; the one turns into the other without much effort; 
                the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is 
                a preparation ready at hand, and places the boor at once on the 
                same footing as the monk:</p>
              <p> 　　a little more amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock.</p>
              <p> 　　Sister Perpetue was a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, 
                who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared the potion 
                according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated 
                her patients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost 
                flung God in their faces, stoned their death agony with prayers 
                mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.</p>
              <p> 　　Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor.</p>
              <p> 　　Beside Sister Perpetue, she was the taper beside the candle.</p>
              <p> 　　Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister 
                of Charity in these admirable words, in which he mingles as much 
                freedom as servitude:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They shall have for their convent only the house of 
                the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapel only their parish 
                church; for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards 
                of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratings only 
                the fear of God; for veil only modesty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This ideal was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice:</p>
              <p> 　　she had never been young, and it seemed as though she would 
                never grow old. No one could have told Sister Simplice's age.</p>
              <p> 　　She was a person-- we dare not say a woman--who was gentle, 
                austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied.</p>
              <p> 　　She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more 
                solid than granite.</p>
              <p> 　　She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly 
                pure and fine.</p>
              <p> 　　There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just 
                what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would 
                have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. 
                This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in 
                this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of God.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have lied, never to 
                have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any 
                single thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister 
                Simplice's distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　She was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable 
                veracity.</p>
              <p> 　　The Abbe Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the 
                deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all 
                bear upon our candor the crack of the little, innocent lie.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not.</p>
              <p> 　　Little lie, innocent lie--does such a thing exist?</p>
              <p> 　　To lie is the absolute form of evil.</p>
              <p> 　　To lie a little is not possible:</p>
              <p> 　　he who lies, lies the whole lie.</p>
              <p> 　　To lie is the very face of the demon.</p>
              <p> 　　Satan has two names; he is called Satan and Lying.</p>
              <p> 　　That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did.</p>
              <p> 　　The result was the whiteness which we have mentioned--a whiteness 
                which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　Her smile was white, her glance was white. There was not a 
                single spider's web, not a grain of dust, on the glass window 
                of that conscience.</p>
              <p> 　　On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken 
                the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as 
                we know, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts 
                to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta 
                when she had been born at Syracuse-- a lie which would have saved 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　This patron saint suited this soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two 
                faults which she had gradually corrected:</p>
              <p> 　　she had a taste for dainties, and she liked to receive letters.</p>
              <p> 　　She never read anything but a book of prayers printed in Latin, 
                in coarse type. She did not understand Latin, but she understood 
                the book.</p>
              <p> 　　This pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probably 
                feeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost 
                exclusively to her care.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine 
                to her in a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.</p>
              <p> 　　On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.</p>
              <p> 　　Fantine awaited M. Madeleine's appearance every day as one 
                awaits a ray of warmth and joy.</p>
              <p> 　　She said to the sisters, &quot;I only live when Monsieur le 
                Maire is here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She had a great deal of fever that day.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as she saw M. Madeleine she asked him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And Cosette?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He replied with a smile:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Soon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine.</p>
              <p> 　　Only he remained an hour instead of half an hour, to Fantine's 
                great delight. He urged every one repeatedly not to allow the 
                invalid to want for anything.</p>
              <p> 　　It was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance 
                became very sombre.</p>
              <p> 　　But this was explained when it became known that the doctor 
                had bent down to his ear and said to him, &quot;She is losing 
                ground fast.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed 
                him attentively examining a road map of France which hung in his 
                study. He wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.</p>

              <p> 　　THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL</p>
              <p> 　　 There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the 
                fish-market; Beaumarchais had something of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter, 
                as alcohol does to wine.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himself eternally, 
                granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin.</p>
              <p> 　　Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs.</p>
              <p> 　　Championnet, who treated miracles brutally, rose from the 
                pavements of Paris; he had, when a small lad, inundated the porticos 
                of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of Saint-Etienne du Mont; he had 
                addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve familiarly to give orders 
                to the phial of Saint Januarius.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent.</p>
              <p> 　　He has villainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach 
                suffers, and handsome eyes because he has wit.</p>
              <p> 　　If Jehovah himself were present, he would go hopping up the 
                steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on boxing.</p>
              <p> 　　All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and 
                straightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists 
                even in the presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is 
                a hero; like the little Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; 
                Barra the drummer-boy was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: &quot;Forward!&quot; 
                as the horse of Scripture says &quot;Vah!&quot; and in a moment 
                he has passed from the small brat to the giant.</p>
              <p> 　　This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure 
                that spread of wings which reaches from Moliere to Barra.</p>
              <p> 　　To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being 
                who amuses himself, because he is unhappy.</p>

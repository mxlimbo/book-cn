              <p> 　　THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY 
                MANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER</p>
              <p> 　　Towards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants 
                of Toulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, 
                and for the purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship Orion, 
                which was employed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which 
                then formed a part of the Mediterranean squadron.</p>
              <p> 　　This vessel, battered as it was,--for the sea had handled 
                it roughly,-- produced a fine effect as it entered the roads.</p>
              <p> 　　It flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute 
                of eleven guns, which it returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two. 
                It has been calculated that what with salvos, royal and military 
                politenesses, courteous exchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, 
                formalities of roadsteads and citadels, sunrises and sunsets, 
                saluted every day by all fortresses and all ships of war, openings 
                and closings of ports, etc., the civilized world, discharged all 
                over the earth, in the course of four and twenty hours, one hundred 
                and fifty thousand useless shots.</p>
              <p> 　　At six francs the shot, that comes to nine hundred thousand 
                francs a day, three hundred millions a year, which vanish in smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　This is a mere detail.</p>
              <p> 　　All this time the poor were dying of hunger.</p>
              <p> 　　The year 1823 was what the Restoration called &quot;the epoch 
                of the Spanish war.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities. 
                A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of 
                France succoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is 
                to say, performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent 
                return to our national traditions, complicated by servitude and 
                by subjection to the cabinets of the North; M. le Duc d'Angouleme, 
                surnamed by the liberal sheets the hero of Andujar, compressing 
                in a triumphal attitude that was somewhat contradicted by his 
                peaceable air, the ancient and very powerful terrorism of the 
                Holy Office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of the liberals; 
                the sansculottes resuscitated, to the great terror of dowagers, 
                under the name of descamisados; monarchy opposing an obstacle 
                to progress described as anarchy; the theories of '89 roughly 
                interrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French 
                idea, which was making the tour of the world; beside the son of 
                France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles 
                Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people 
                as a volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers 
                of the Empire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, 
                after eight years of repose, and under the white cockade; the 
                tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, 
                as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; 
                monks mingled with our troops; the spirit of liberty and of novelty 
                brought to its senses by bayonets; principles slaughtered by cannonades; 
                France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind; 
                in addition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating, 
                cities besieged by millions; no military perils, and yet possible 
                explosions, as in every mine which is surprised and invaded; but 
                little bloodshed, little honor won, shame for some, glory for 
                no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended from 
                Louis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　Its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand 
                politics.</p>
              <p> 　　Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadero, 
                among others, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, 
                the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole 
                effect was suspicious; history approves of France for making a 
                difficulty about accepting this false triumph.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed evident that certain Spanish officers charged with 
                resistance yielded too easily; the idea of corruption was connected 
                with the victory; it appears as though generals and not battles 
                had been won, and the conquering soldier returned humiliated.</p>
              <p> 　　A debasing war, in short, in which the Bank of France could 
                be read in the folds of the flag.</p>
              <p> 　　Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen 
                in formidable ruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, 
                and began to regret Palafox.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchine rather 
                than Ballesteros in front of her.</p>
              <p> 　　From a still more serious point of view, and one which it 
                is also proper to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the 
                military spirit of France, enraged the democratic spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　It was an enterprise of inthralment.</p>
              <p> 　　In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the son 
                of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideous 
                contradiction.</p>
              <p> 　　France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to stifle 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French Revolution:</p>
              <p> 　　liberty darts rays from France.</p>
              <p> 　　That is a solar fact.</p>
              <p> 　　Blind is he who will not see!</p>
              <p> 　　It was Bonaparte who said it.</p>
              <p> 　　The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, 
                was then, at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. 
                It was France who committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, 
                for, with the exception of wars of liberation, everything that 
                armies do is by foul means.</p>
              <p> 　　The words passive obedience indicate this. An army is a strange 
                masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous 
                sum of impotence.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despite humanity, 
                explained.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them.</p>
              <p> 　　They took it for a success.</p>
              <p> 　　They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea 
                slain to order.</p>
              <p> 　　They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degree that 
                they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their 
                establishment as an element of strength.</p>
              <p> 　　The spirit of the ambush entered into their politics.</p>
              <p> 　　1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish campaign became in 
                their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by right 
                Divine.</p>
              <p> 　　France, having re-established elrey netto in Spain, might 
                well have re-established the absolute king at home.</p>
              <p> 　　They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience 
                of the soldier for the consent of the nation.</p>
              <p> 　　Such confidence is the ruin of thrones.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of 
                a machineel tree, nor in the shadow of an army.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us return to the ship Orion.</p>
              <p> 　　During the operations of the army commanded by the prince 
                generalissimo, a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean.</p>
              <p> 　　We have just stated that the Orion belonged to this fleet, 
                and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about 
                it which attracts and engages a crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　It is because it is great, and the crowd loves what is great.</p>
              <p> 　　A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations 
                of the genius of man with the powers of nature.</p>
              <p> 　　A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest 
                and the lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the 
                same time with three forms of substance,--solid, liquid, and fluid,-- 
                and it must do battle with all three.</p>
              <p> 　　It has eleven claws of iron with which to seize the granite 
                on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more antennae than 
                winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds.</p>
              <p> 　　Its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons 
                as through enormous trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder.</p>
              <p> 　　The ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness 
                of its billows, but the vessel has its soul, its compass, which 
                counsels it and always shows it the north. In the blackest nights, 
                its lanterns supply the place of the stars. Thus, against the 
                wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the water, wood; 
                against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against the shadows, 
                its light; against immensity, a needle.</p>
              <p> 　　If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions 
                which, taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one 
                has only to enter one of the six-story covered construction stocks, 
                in the ports of Brest or Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glass 
                there, as it were.</p>
              <p> 　　This colossal beam is a yard; that great column of wood which 
                stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the 
                main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in 
                the clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its 
                base is three feet.</p>
              <p> 　　The English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and 
                seventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers employed 
                cables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains on a ship 
                of a hundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth, and 
                eight feet in depth.</p>
              <p> 　　And how much wood is required to make this ship?</p>
              <p> 　　Three thousand cubic metres. It is a floating forest.</p>
              <p> 　　And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question 
                here of the military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple 
                sailing-vessel; steam, then in its infancy, has since added new 
                miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel. At the 
                present time, for example, the mixed vessel with a screw is a 
                surprising machine, propelled by three thousand square metres 
                of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse-power.</p>
              <p> 　　Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher 
                Columbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It 
                is as inexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores 
                up the wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness 
                of the billows, it floats, and it reigns.</p>
              <p> 　　There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that 
                sixty-foot yard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four 
                hundred feet tall, when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, 
                is twisted in the jaws of the waves like a fisherman's hook in 
                the jaws of a pike, when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive 
                and futile roars, which the hurricane bears forth into the void 
                and into night, when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed 
                in a power and majesty which are superior.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in 
                an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought, Hence in 
                the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines 
                of war and of navigation, without being able to explain perfectly 
                to themselves why.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, 
                sluices, and the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with 
                a multitude of idlers and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose 
                business consisted in staring at the Orion.</p>
              <p> 　　The Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; 
                in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles 
                had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of 
                half its speed; it had gone into the dry dock the year before 
                this, in order to have the barnacles scraped off, then it had 
                put to sea again; but this cleaning had affected the bolts of 
                the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sides 
                had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating in those 
                days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak.</p>
              <p> 　　A violent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved 
                in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged 
                the foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, 
                the Orion had run back to Toulon.</p>
              <p> 　　It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs 
                were begun.</p>
              <p> 　　The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some 
                of the planks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, 
                to permit of air entering the hold.</p>
              <p> 　　One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an 
                accident.</p>
              <p> 　　The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to 
                take the upper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost 
                his balance; he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the 
                Arsenal quay uttered a cry; the man's head overbalanced his body; 
                the man fell around the yard, with his hands outstretched towards 
                the abyss; on his way he seized the footrope, first with one hand, 
                then with the other, and remained hanging from it:</p>
              <p> 　　the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall 
                had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man 
                swayed back and forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in 
                a sling.</p>
              <p> 　　It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; 
                not one of the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied 
                for the service, dared to attempt it.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the unfortunate topman was losing his strength; 
                his anguish could not be discerned on his face, but his exhaustion 
                was visible in every limb; his arms were contracted in horrible 
                twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served but 
                to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, 
                for fear of exhausting his strength.</p>
              <p> 　　All were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold 
                on the rope, and, from instant to instant, heads were turned aside 
                that his fall might not be seen. There are moments when a bit 
                of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and it 
                is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from 
                it and fall like a ripe fruit.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with 
                the agility of a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was 
                a convict; he wore a green cap; he was a life convict.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving on a level with the top, a gust of wind carried 
                away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen:</p>
              <p> 　　he was not a young man.</p>
              <p> 　　A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys 
                had, in fact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer 
                of the watch, and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation 
                of the crew, while all the sailors were trembling and drawing 
                back, he had asked the officer's permission to risk his life to 
                save the topman; at an affirmative sign from the officer he had 
                broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer, 
                then he had caught up a rope, and had dashed into the rigging: 
                no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease that chain had 
                been broken; it was only later on that the incident was recalled.</p>
              <p> 　　In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds 
                and appeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during 
                which the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, 
                seemed centuries to those who were looking on. At last, the convict 
                raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew 
                a long breath.</p>
              <p> 　　He was seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the 
                point, he fastened the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed 
                the other end to hang down, then he began to descend the rope, 
                hand over hand, and then,--and the anguish was indescribable,--instead 
                of one man suspended over the gulf, there were two.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, 
                only here the spider brought life, not death.</p>
              <p> 　　Ten thousand glances were fastened on this group; not a cry, 
                not a word; the same tremor contracted every brow; all mouths 
                held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff 
                to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself 
                to a position near the sailor.</p>
              <p> 　　It was high time; one minute more, and the exhausted and despairing 
                man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which 
                he clung with one hand, while he was working with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　At last, he was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag 
                the sailor up after him; he held him there a moment to allow him 
                to recover his strength, then he grasped him in his arms and carried 
                him, walking on the yard himself to the cap, and from there to 
                the main-top, where he left him in the hands of his comrades.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment the crowd broke into applause:</p>
              <p> 　　old convict-sergeants among them wept, and women embraced 
                each other on the quay, and all voices were heard to cry with 
                a sort of tender rage, &quot;Pardon for that man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent 
                to rejoin his detachment.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped into 
                the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were 
                following him.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was that 
                he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw 
                him hesitate and stagger.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout:</p>
              <p> 　　the convict had fallen into the sea.</p>
              <p> 　　The fall was perilous.</p>
              <p> 　　The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside the Orion, and 
                the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it was to 
                be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four 
                men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them 
                on; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not 
                risen to the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving 
                a ripple, as though he had fallen into a cask of oil:</p>
              <p> 　　they sounded, they dived.</p>
              <p> 　　In vain.</p>
              <p> 　　The search was continued until the evening: they did not even 
                find the body.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nov. 17, 1823.</p>
              <p> 　　Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on board 
                of the Orion, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor, 
                fell into the sea and was drowned.</p>
              <p> 　　The body has not yet been found; it is supposed that it is 
                entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point:</p>
              <p> 　　this man was committed under the number 9,430, and his name 
                was Jean Valjean.&quot;</p>

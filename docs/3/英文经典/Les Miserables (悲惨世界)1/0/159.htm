              <p> 　　TO SCOFF, TO REIGN</p>
              <p> 　　 There is no limit to Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　No city has had that domination which sometimes derides those 
                whom it subjugates.</p>
              <p> 　　To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris makes more than the law, it makes the fashion; Paris 
                sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris may be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself 
                this luxury; then the universe is stupid in company with it; then 
                Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, says:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How stupid I am!&quot; and bursts out laughing in the 
                face of the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a 
                strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should 
                be amicable neighbors, that all this majesty should not be thrown 
                into disorder by all this parody, and that the same mouth can 
                to-day blow into the trump of the Judgment Day, and to-morrow 
                into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign joviality.</p>
              <p> 　　Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.</p>
              <p> 　　Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace.</p>
              <p> 　　Its explosions, its days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, 
                its epics, go forth to the bounds of the universe, and so also 
                do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the mouth of a volcano 
                which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks.</p>
              <p> 　　It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; 
                the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies 
                and lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; 
                it has a prodigious 14th of July, which delivers the globe; it 
                forces all nations to take the oath of tennis; its night of the 
                4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; 
                it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; it multiplies 
                itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; it fills with 
                its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, 
                Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere where the 
                future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de 
                Leon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, it whispers 
                the mighty countersign:</p>
              <p> 　　Liberty, in the ear of the American abolitionists grouped 
                about the boat at Harper's Ferry, and in the ear of the patriots 
                of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi before the Gozzi 
                inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga; it 
                creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was while 
                proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at 
                Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune 
                under the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; 
                its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, 
                its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, 
                Regnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all 
                moments, Moliere for all centuries; it makes its language to be 
                talked by the universal mouth, and that language becomes the word; 
                it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, the liberating 
                dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty friends, 
                and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all 
                heroes of all nations have been made since 1789; this does not 
                prevent vagabondism, and that enormous genius which is called 
                Paris, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in 
                charcoal Bouginier's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus 
                and writes Credeville the thief on the Pyramids.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding 
                it is laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. A 
                heap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. 
                It is more than great, it is immense.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because it is daring.</p>
              <p> 　　To dare; that is the price of progress.</p>
              <p> 　　All sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. 
                In order that the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice 
                that Montesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach 
                it, that Beaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should 
                calculate it, that Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should 
                premeditate it; it is necessary that Danton should dare it.</p>
              <p> 　　The cry:</p>
              <p> 　　Audacity! is a Fiat lux.</p>
              <p> 　　It is necessary, for the sake of the forward march of the 
                human race, that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently 
                on the heights.</p>
              <p> 　　Daring deeds dazzle history and are one of man's great sources 
                of light. The dawn dares when it rises.</p>
              <p> 　　To attempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful 
                to one's self, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by 
                the small amount of fear that it occasions us, now to affront 
                unjust power, again to insult drunken victory, to hold one's position, 
                to stand one's ground; that is the example which nations need, 
                that is the light which electrifies them. The same formidable 
                lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne's 
                short pipe.</p>

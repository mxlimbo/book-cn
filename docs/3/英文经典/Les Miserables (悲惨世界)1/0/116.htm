              <p> 　　THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was 
                very vast and of singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens 
                which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night.</p>
              <p> 　　This garden was oblong in shape, with an alley of large poplars 
                at the further end, tolerably tall forest trees in the corners, 
                and an unshaded space in the centre, where could be seen a very 
                large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled and bristling 
                like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whose glass frames 
                sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and there stood 
                stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were bordered 
                with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half taken 
                possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served 
                him as a means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, 
                directly against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face 
                was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed 
                vaguely through the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers 
                were distinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to 
                serve as a shed.</p>
              <p> 　　The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing 
                on the Rue Petit-Picpus, turned two facades, at right angles, 
                towards this garden. These interior facades were even more tragic 
                than the exterior. All the windows were grated.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them.</p>
              <p> 　　The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those facades 
                cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like 
                an immense black pall.</p>
              <p> 　　No other house was visible.</p>
              <p> 　　The bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which intersected 
                as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the low 
                roofs of the Rue Polonceau.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. 
                There was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the 
                hour; but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any 
                one to walk in, even in broad daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes 
                and put them on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. 
                A man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden. 
                The child, whose thoughts were still on the Thenardier, shared 
                his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette trembled and pressed close to him.</p>
              <p> 　　They heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the 
                blind alley and the streets; the blows of their gun-stocks against 
                the stones; Javert's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted, 
                and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished.</p>
              <p> 　　At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though 
                that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean held his breath.</p>
              <p> 　　He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette's mouth.</p>
              <p> 　　However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, 
                that this frightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not 
                disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed 
                as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which 
                the Scriptures speak.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound 
                arose; a sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as 
                the other had been horrible.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst 
                of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the 
                night; women's voices, but voices composed at one and the same 
                time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of 
                children,-- voices which are not of the earth, and which resemble 
                those that the newborn infant still hears, and which the dying 
                man hears already. This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice 
                which towered above the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would 
                have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.</p>
              <p> 　　They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; 
                but both of them, the man and the child, the penitent and the 
                innocent, felt that they must kneel.</p>
              <p> 　　These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did 
                not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a 
                supernatural chant in an uninhabited house.</p>
              <p> 　　While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. 
                He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have 
                within us, unfolding.</p>
              <p> 　　The song died away.</p>
              <p> 　　It may have lasted a long time.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean could not have told.</p>
              <p> 　　Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.</p>
              <p> 　　All fell silent again.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no longer anything in the street; there was nothing 
                in the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　That which had menaced, that which had reassured him,--all 
                had vanished.</p>
              <p> 　　The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall, 
                and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy sound.</p>

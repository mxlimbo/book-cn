              <p> 　　NEW TROUBLES</p>
              <p> 　　 When the hour came for him to take his departure from the 
                galleys, when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, 
                Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented; 
                a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly 
                penetrated within him. But it was not long before this ray paled.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty.</p>
              <p> 　　He had believed in a new life. He very speedily perceived 
                what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.</p>
              <p> 　　And this was encompassed with much bitterness.</p>
              <p> 　　He had calculated that his earnings, during his sojourn in 
                the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs.</p>
              <p> 　　It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in 
                his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days 
                during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty 
                francs.</p>
              <p> 　　At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local 
                levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, 
                which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had understood 
                nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say the 
                word--robbed.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in 
                front of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading 
                bales. He offered his services.</p>
              <p> 　　Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work.</p>
              <p> 　　He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master 
                seemed pleased.</p>
              <p> 　　While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, and 
                demanded his papers.</p>
              <p> 　　It was necessary to show him the yellow passport.</p>
              <p> 　　That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while 
                before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which 
                they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty 
                sous.</p>
              <p> 　　When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on 
                the following day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery 
                and requested to be paid.</p>
              <p> 　　The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous.</p>
              <p> 　　He objected. He was told, &quot;That is enough for thee.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He persisted.</p>
              <p> 　　The master looked him straight between the eyes, and said 
                to him &quot;Beware of the prison.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.</p>
              <p> 　　Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him 
                wholesale. Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.</p>
              <p> 　　Liberation is not deliverance.</p>
              <p> 　　One gets free from the galleys, but not from the sentence.</p>
              <p> 　　That is what happened to him at Grasse.</p>
              <p> 　　We have seen in what manner he was received at D----</p>

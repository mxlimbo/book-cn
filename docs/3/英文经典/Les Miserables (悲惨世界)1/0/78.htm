              <p> 　　FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p> 　　 Towards four o'clock the condition of the English army was 
                serious. The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill 
                of the right wing, Picton of the left wing.</p>
              <p> 　　The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the 
                Hollando-Belgians: &quot;Nassau! Brunswick!</p>
              <p> 　　Never retreat!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of 
                Wellington; Picton was dead.</p>
              <p> 　　At the very moment when the English had captured from the 
                French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed 
                the English general, Picton, with a bullet through the head.</p>
              <p> 　　The battle had, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont 
                and La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; 
                La Haie-Sainte was taken.</p>
              <p> 　　Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two 
                men survived; all the officers, except five, were either dead 
                or captured.</p>
              <p> 　　Three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn.</p>
              <p> 　　A sergeant of the English Guards, the foremost boxer in England, 
                reputed invulnerable by his companions, had been killed there 
                by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had been dislodged, Alten 
                put to the sword.</p>
              <p> 　　Many flags had been lost, one from Alten's division, and one 
                from the battalion of Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house 
                of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no longer existed; Ponsonby's 
                great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalry 
                had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers 
                of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six hundred remained; 
                out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the earth,--Hamilton 
                wounded, Mater slain.</p>
              <p> 　　Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon 
                was dead.</p>
              <p> 　　Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, had 
                been annihilated.</p>
              <p> 　　Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed 
                but one rallying-point, the centre.</p>
              <p> 　　That point still held firm. Wellington reinforced it.</p>
              <p> 　　He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he summoned 
                Chasse, who was at Braine-l'Alleud.</p>
              <p> 　　The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, 
                and very compact, was strongly posted.</p>
              <p> 　　It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind 
                it the village, and in front of it the slope, which was tolerably 
                steep then.</p>
              <p> 　　It rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time 
                belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and which marks the intersection 
                of the roads--a pile of the sixteenth century, and so robust that 
                the cannon-balls rebounded from it without injuring it.</p>
              <p> 　　All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here 
                and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat 
                of a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There 
                artillery was ambushed in the brushwood.</p>
              <p> 　　This punic labor, incontestably authorized by war, which permits 
                traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by 
                the Emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the 
                enemy's batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returned 
                and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the 
                two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of 
                the plateau a battalion of Kempt's brigade, the 95th, armed with 
                carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch 
                army was well posted.</p>
              <p> 　　The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, then 
                adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of 
                Groenendael and Boitsfort.</p>
              <p> 　　An army could not retreat thither without dissolving; the 
                regiments would have broken up immediately there. The artillery 
                would have been lost among the morasses.</p>
              <p> 　　The retreat, according to many a man versed in the art,--though 
                it is disputed by others,--would have been a disorganized flight.</p>
              <p> 　　To this centre, Wellington added one of Chasse's brigades 
                taken from the right wing, and one of Wincke's brigades taken 
                from the left wing, plus Clinton's division.</p>
              <p> 　　To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to the brigades 
                of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as reinforcements 
                and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau's contingent, Kielmansegg's 
                Hanoverians, and Ompteda's Germans.</p>
              <p> 　　This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. The right 
                wing, as Charras says, was thrown back on the centre. An enormous 
                battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now 
                stands what is called the &quot;Museum of Waterloo.&quot; Besides 
                this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, Somerset's 
                Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining 
                half of the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, 
                Somerset remained.</p>
              <p> 　　The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a 
                redoubt, was ranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with 
                a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth.</p>
              <p> 　　This work was not finished; there had been no time to make 
                a palisade for it.</p>
              <p> 　　Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there 
                remained the whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance 
                of the old mill of Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, 
                beneath an elm, which an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased 
                later on for two hundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington 
                was coldly heroic.</p>
              <p> 　　The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell 
                at his side.</p>
              <p> 　　Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My lord, what are your orders in case you are killed?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To do like me,&quot; replied Wellington. To Clinton 
                he said laconically, &quot;To hold this spot to the last man.&quot; 
                The day was evidently turning out ill.</p>
              <p> 　　Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, 
                of Salamanca:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Boys, can retreat be thought of?</p>
              <p> 　　Think of old England!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Towards four o'clock, the English line drew back.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except 
                the artillery and the sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared:</p>
              <p> 　　the regiments, dislodged by the shells and the French bullets, 
                retreated into the bottom, now intersected by the back road of 
                the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a retrograde movement took place, 
                the English front hid itself, Wellington drew back.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The beginning of retreat!&quot; cried Napoleon.</p>

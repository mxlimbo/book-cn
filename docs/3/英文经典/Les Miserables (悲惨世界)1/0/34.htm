              <p>　　A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER</p>
              <p>　　Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce 
                one as the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table 
                is smoke.</p>
              <p>　　Fameuil and Dahlia were humming.</p>
              <p>　　Tholomyes was drinking.Zephine was laughing, Fantine smiling, 
                Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud.</p>
              <p>　　Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Blachevelle, I adore you.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　This called forth a question from Blachevelle:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love 
                you?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I!&quot; cried Favourite.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p>　　Do not say that even in jest!If you were to cease to love me, 
                I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I should rend you, 
                I would throw you into the water, I would have you arrested.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man 
                who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes, I would scream to the police!</p>
              <p>　　Ah!</p>
              <p>　　I should not restrain myself, not at all!</p>
              <p>　　Rabble!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, 
                and closed both eyes proudly.</p>
              <p>　　Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid 
                the uproar:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of 
                yours?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I?</p>
              <p>　　I detest him,&quot; replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing 
                her fork again.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;He is avaricious.</p>
              <p>　　I love the little fellow opposite me in my house.</p>
              <p>　　He is very nice, that young man; do you know him?One can see 
                that he is an actor by profession.</p>
              <p>　　I love actors.As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him:</p>
              <p>　　`Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone.</p>
              <p>　　There he goes with his shouting.</p>
              <p>　　But, my dear, you are splitting my head!'</p>
              <p>　　So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high 
                as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how 
                do I know what? so that he can be heard down stairs!He earns twenty 
                sous a day at an attorney's by penning quibbles.He is the son 
                of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is 
                very nice.</p>
              <p>　　He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter 
                for some pancakes, he said to me:</p>
              <p>　　`Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.'</p>
              <p>　　It is only artists who can say such things as that.</p>
              <p>　　Ah! he is very nice.I am in a fair way to go out of my head 
                over that little fellow.Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I 
                adore him--how I lie!</p>
              <p>　　Hey!</p>
              <p>　　How I do lie!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Favourite paused, and then went on:--</p>
              <p>　　&quot;I am sad, you see, Dahlia.</p>
              <p>　　It has done nothing but rain all summer; the wind irritates 
                me; the wind does not abate.</p>
              <p>　　Blachevelle is very stingy; there are hardly any green peas 
                in the market; one does not know what to eat.</p>
              <p>　　I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and 
                then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with 
                a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.&quot;</p>

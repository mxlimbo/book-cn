              <p> 　　THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES</p>
              <p> 　　 Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; 
                a beginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing 
                to both armies, but still more so for the English than for the 
                French.</p>
              <p> 　　It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the 
                downpour, the water had accumulated here and there in the hollows 
                of the plain as if in casks; at some points the gear of the artillery 
                carriages was buried up to the axles, the circingles of the horses 
                were dripping with liquid mud.</p>
              <p> 　　If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports 
                on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath 
                the wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the 
                direction of Papelotte would have been impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　The affair began late.</p>
              <p> 　　Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in the habit of 
                keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol, aiming 
                it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had 
                been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and 
                gallop freely.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come 
                out and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　It was no longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　When the first cannon was fired, the English general, Colville, 
                looked at his watch, and noted that it was thirty-five minutes 
                past eleven.</p>
              <p> 　　The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than 
                the Emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French 
                resting on Hougomont.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling Quiot's 
                brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right wing 
                of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested 
                on Papelotte.</p>
              <p> 　　The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan 
                was to draw Wellington thither, and to make him swerve to the 
                left. This plan would have succeeded if the four companies of 
                the English guards and the brave Belgians of Perponcher's division 
                had not held the position solidly, and Wellington, instead of 
                massing his troops there, could confine himself to despatching 
                thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of guards 
                and one battalion from Brunswick.</p>
              <p> 　　The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was 
                calculated, in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off 
                the road to Brussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, 
                to force Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, 
                thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. With 
                the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded Papelotte 
                was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.</p>
              <p> 　　A detail to be noted.</p>
              <p> 　　There was in the English infantry, particularly in Kempt's 
                brigade, a great many raw recruits.</p>
              <p> 　　These young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable 
                infantry; their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the 
                dilemma; they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: 
                the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so 
                to speak, his own general.</p>
              <p> 　　These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and 
                fury.</p>
              <p> 　　This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.</p>
              <p> 　　After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.</p>
              <p> 　　There is in this day an obscure interval, from mid-day to 
                four o'clock; the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, 
                and participates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict.</p>
              <p> 　　Twilight reigns over it.</p>
              <p> 　　We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, 
                paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, 
                floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, 
                hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos 
                garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick 
                mingled with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers 
                with great, white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders 
                for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques 
                of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with 
                their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters of our grenadiers; 
                pictures, not strategic lines--what Salvator Rosa requires, not 
                what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. 
                Quid obscurum, quid divinum.</p>
              <p> 　　Each historian traces, to some extent, the particular feature 
                which pleases him amid this pellmell. Whatever may be the combinations 
                of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an incalculable 
                ebb.</p>
              <p> 　　During the action the plans of the two leaders enter into 
                each other and become mutually thrown out of shape.</p>
              <p> 　　Such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants 
                than such another, just as more or less spongy soils soak up more 
                or less quickly the water which is poured on them. It becomes 
                necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like; a series 
                of expenditures which are the unforeseen.</p>
              <p> 　　The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the 
                trails of blood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, 
                the regiments form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; 
                all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other.</p>
              <p> 　　Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives, the cavalry 
                rushes in where the artillery was, the battalions are like smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　There was something there; seek it.</p>
              <p> 　　It has disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre 
                folds advance and retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes 
                forward, hurls back, distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes.</p>
              <p> 　　What is a fray? an oscillation?</p>
              <p> 　　The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute, 
                not a day.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those 
                powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is 
                better than Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at 
                three o'clock. Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy.</p>
              <p> 　　That is what confers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us add, that there is a certain instant when the battle 
                degenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, and disperses 
                into innumerable detailed feats, which, to borrow the expression 
                of Napoleon himself, &quot;belong rather to the biography of the 
                regiments than to the history of the army.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The historian has, in this case, the evident right to sum 
                up the whole.</p>
              <p> 　　He cannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the 
                struggle, and it is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious 
                he may be, to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud 
                which is called a battle.</p>
              <p> 　　This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly 
                applicable to Waterloo.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle 
                came to a point.</p>

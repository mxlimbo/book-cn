              <p> 　　BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS</p>
              <p> 　　Who was in the coffin?</p>
              <p> 　　The reader knows.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, 
                and he could almost breathe.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience 
                confers security of the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been progressing, 
                and progressing favorably, since the preceding day.</p>
              <p> 　　He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no doubt as to the end.</p>
              <p> 　　Never was there a more critical situation, never more complete 
                composure.</p>
              <p> 　　The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible 
                peace. It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead 
                entered into Jean Valjean's tranquillity.</p>
              <p> 　　From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, 
                and he had followed, all the phases of the terrible drama which 
                he was playing with death.</p>
              <p> 　　Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper 
                plank, Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven 
                off.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew, from the diminution in the jolting, when they left 
                the pavements and reached the earth road.</p>
              <p> 　　He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing 
                the bridge of Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　At the first halt, he had understood that they were entering 
                the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here is the grave.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating 
                against the planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which 
                was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into 
                the cavity.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he experienced a giddiness.</p>
              <p> 　　The undertaker's man and the grave-digger had probably allowed 
                the coffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before 
                the foot.</p>
              <p> 　　He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal 
                and motionless.</p>
              <p> 　　He had just touched the bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a certain sensation of cold.</p>
              <p> 　　A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn.</p>
              <p> 　　He heard Latin words, which he did not understand, pass over 
                him, so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in 
                vitam aeternam, et alii in approbrium, ut videant semper.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A child's voice said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;De profundis.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The grave voice began again:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The child's voice responded:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Et lux perpetua luceat ei.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops 
                of rain on the plank which covered him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was probably the holy water.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This will be over soon now.</p>
              <p> 　　Patience for a little while longer.</p>
              <p> 　　The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will take 
                Mestienne off to drink.</p>
              <p> 　　I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will return alone, and 
                I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The grave voice resumed</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Requiescat in pace.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the child's voice said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Amen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreating 
                footsteps.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, they are going now,&quot; thought he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am alone.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to 
                him to be a clap of thunder.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.</p>
              <p> 　　A second shovelful fell.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped 
                up.</p>
              <p> 　　A third shovelful of earth fell.</p>
              <p> 　　Then a fourth.</p>
              <p> 　　There are things which are too strong for the strongest man. 
                Jean Valjean lost consciousness.</p>

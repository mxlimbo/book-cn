              <p> 　　 IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES</p>
              <p> 　　 Uncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean:</p>
              <p> 　　fortunately it still lasted for the men.</p>
              <p> 　　He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost for 
                them, but gained for him.</p>
              <p> 　　He slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself, 
                and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region of the Jardin 
                des Plantes.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was beginning to be tired.</p>
              <p> 　　He took her in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, 
                and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there 
                being a moon.</p>
              <p> 　　He redoubled his pace.</p>
              <p> 　　In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the 
                front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient 
                inscription:--</p>
              <p> 　　</p>
              <p> 　　 De Goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique;[14] </p>
              <p> 　　 Venez choisir des cruches et des broos, </p>
              <p> 　　 Des pots a fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique. </p>
              <p> 　　 A tout venant le Coeur vend des Carreaux.</p>
              <p> 　　 [14]</p>
              <p> 　　This is the factory of Goblet Junior: </p>
              <p> 　　Come choose your jugs and crocks, </p>
              <p> 　　Flower-pots, pipes, bricks. </p>
              <p> 　　The Heart sells Diamonds to every comer.He left behind him 
                the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor, skirted the 
                Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the quay.</p>
              <p> 　　There he turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　The quay was deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　The streets were deserted.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no one behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He drew a long breath.</p>
              <p> 　　He gained the Pont d'Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.</p>
              <p> 　　He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a 
                sou.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is two sous,&quot; said the old soldier in charge 
                of the bridge. &quot;You are carrying a child who can walk.</p>
              <p> 　　Pay for two.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. 
                Every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away.</p>
              <p> 　　A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, 
                and on its way, like him, to the right bank.</p>
              <p> 　　This was of use to him. He could traverse the bridge in the 
                shadow of the cart.</p>
              <p> 　　Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were 
                benumbed, wanted to walk.</p>
              <p> 　　He set her on the ground and took her hand again.</p>
              <p> 　　The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on 
                his right. He directed his course thither.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to reach them, it was necessary to risk himself in 
                a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not hesitate.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who were on his track had evidently lost the scent, 
                and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out of danger.</p>
              <p> 　　Hunted, yes; followed, no.</p>
              <p> 　　A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened 
                out between two timber-yards enclosed in walls.</p>
              <p> 　　This street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly 
                for him.</p>
              <p> 　　Before entering it he cast a glance behind him,</p>
              <p> 　　From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent 
                of the Pont d'Austerlitz.</p>
              <p> 　　Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.</p>
              <p> 　　These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes 
                and were on their way to the right bank.</p>
              <p> 　　These four shadows were the four men.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.</p>
              <p> 　　One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, 
                stepped on the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he 
                was crossing the large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, 
                he might escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, 
                the market-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built 
                upon.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent 
                little street.</p>
              <p> 　　He entered it.</p>

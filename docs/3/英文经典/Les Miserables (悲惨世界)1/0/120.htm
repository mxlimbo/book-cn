              <p> 　　 The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, 
                so to speak, had come about in the simplest possible manner.</p>
              <p> 　　When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert 
                had arrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from 
                the town jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had 
                betaken himself to Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything 
                disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the 
                sea.</p>
              <p> 　　No forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every 
                sort know this.</p>
              <p> 　　They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save.</p>
              <p> 　　The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek 
                what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. 
                sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture 
                of Jean Valjean. Javert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion 
                had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture 
                under Comte Angles. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already 
                been Javert's patron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached 
                to the police force of Paris. There Javert rendered himself useful 
                in divers and, though the word may seem strange for such services, 
                honorable manners.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day 
                causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf 
                of yesterday,--when, in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he 
                who never read newspapers; but Javert, a monarchical man, had 
                a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the 
                &quot;Prince Generalissimo&quot; into Bayonne. Just as he was 
                finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name 
                of Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page.</p>
              <p> 　　The paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, 
                and published the fact in such formal terms that Javert did not 
                doubt it.</p>
              <p> 　　He confined himself to the remark, &quot;That's a good entry.&quot; 
                Then he threw aside the paper, and thought no more about it.</p>
              <p> 　　Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was 
                transmitted from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture 
                of police in Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which 
                had taken place, under peculiar circumstances, as it was said, 
                in the commune of Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, 
                who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that 
                neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered 
                to the name of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, 
                who had died in the hospital, it was not known where or when.</p>
              <p> 　　This report came under Javert's eye and set him to thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　The name of Fantine was well known to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He remembered that Jean Valjean had made him, Javert, burst 
                into laughter, by asking him for a respite of three days, for 
                the purpose of going to fetch that creature's child.</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in 
                Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for 
                Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　Some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was 
                the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he had 
                already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood 
                of that village, for he had not been seen in the village itself. 
                What had he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? 
                It could not even be surmised.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert understood it now. Fantine's daughter was there.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was going there in search of her.</p>
              <p> 　　And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could 
                that stranger be?</p>
              <p> 　　Could it be Jean Valjean?</p>
              <p> 　　But Jean Valjean was dead.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took the coach 
                from the Pewter Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made 
                a trip to Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; 
                he found a great deal of obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　For the first few days the Thenardiers had chattered in their 
                rage. The disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in 
                the village. He immediately obtained numerous versions of the 
                story, which ended in the abduction of a child.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the police report.</p>
              <p> 　　But their first vexation having passed off, Thenardier, with 
                his wonderful instinct, had very quickly comprehended that it 
                is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the Crown, and 
                that his complaints with regard to the abduction of Cosette would 
                have as their first result to fix upon himself, and upon many 
                dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering eye of justice.</p>
              <p> 　　The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought 
                to them.</p>
              <p> 　　And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs 
                which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on 
                his wife's mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child 
                was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt 
                he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature 
                &quot;taken from him&quot; so hastily; he should have liked to 
                keep her two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her 
                &quot;grandfather&quot; had come for her in the most natural way 
                in the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He added the &quot;grandfather,&quot; which produced a good 
                effect.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at 
                Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, 
                into Thenardier's history.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier replied with simplicity:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a wealthy farmer. I saw his passport.</p>
              <p> 　　I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon 
                Javert returned to Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Jean Valjean is certainly dead,&quot; said he, &quot;and 
                I am a ninny.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course 
                of March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in 
                the parish of Saint-Medard and who had been surnamed &quot;the 
                mendicant who gives alms.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name 
                no one knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of 
                eight years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had 
                come from Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert 
                prick up his ears.</p>
              <p> 　　An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person 
                had given alms, added a few more details.</p>
              <p> 　　This gentleman of property was very shy,-- never coming out 
                except in the evening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally 
                to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach him. He wore 
                a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, 
                being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert's curiosity 
                in a decided manner.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without 
                alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's outfit for a day, and the 
                place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, 
                whining orisons through his nose, and playing the spy under cover 
                of prayer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The suspected individual&quot; did indeed approach Javert 
                thus disguised, and bestow alms on him.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment Javert raised his head, and the shock which 
                Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the one 
                received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's 
                death was official; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when 
                in doubt, Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on 
                any one's collar.</p>
              <p> 　　He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got &quot;the 
                old woman&quot; to talking, which was no difficult matter.</p>
              <p> 　　The old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined 
                with millions, and narrated to him the episode of the thousand-franc 
                bill.</p>
              <p> 　　She had seen it! She had handled it!</p>
              <p> 　　Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　He came and listened at the mysterious lodger's door, hoping 
                to catch the sound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle 
                through the key-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise 
                made by the fall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old 
                woman, who, hearing the rattling of coin, suspected that he might 
                be intending to leave, and made haste to warn Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert was waiting for 
                him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had 
                not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; 
                that was his secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in 
                the first place, because the slightest indiscretion might put 
                Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict 
                who had made his escape and was reputed dead, on a criminal whom 
                justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the 
                most dangerous sort, was a magnificent success which the old members 
                of the Parisian police would assuredly not leave to a new-comer 
                like Javert, and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict; 
                and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste for the 
                unforeseen.</p>
              <p> 　　He hated those well-heralded successes which are talked of 
                long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred 
                to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly 
                at the last.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from 
                corner to corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him 
                for a single instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed 
                himself to be the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. Why 
                had not Javert arrested Jean Valjean?</p>
              <p> 　　Because he was still in doubt.</p>
              <p> 　　It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not 
                precisely at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several 
                arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even 
                as far as the Chambers, and had rendered the Prefecture timid.</p>
              <p> 　　Interference with individual liberty was a grave matter.</p>
              <p> 　　The police agents were afraid of making a mistake; the prefect 
                laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader 
                can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced 
                by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: &quot;Yesterday, 
                an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do 
                gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was 
                arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped 
                convict!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his 
                own; injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions 
                of the prefect.</p>
              <p> 　　He was really in doubt.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune 
                of being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris 
                for Cosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace 
                to the pace of the child--all this, without his being aware of 
                it, had altered Jean Valjean's walk, and impressed on his bearing 
                such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person 
                of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake.</p>
              <p> 　　The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of 
                an emigre preceptor, the declaration of Thenardier which made 
                a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in 
                prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered 
                thick in Javert's mind.</p>
              <p> 　　For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand 
                for his papers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this 
                man was not a good, honest old fellow living on his income, he 
                was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated 
                in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous 
                band, who gave alms to conceal his other talents, which was an 
                old dodge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices' retreats in case 
                of emergencies, in which he would, no doubt, take refuge.</p>
              <p> 　　All these turns which he was making through the streets seemed 
                to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man.</p>
              <p> 　　To arrest him too hastily would be &quot;to kill the hen that 
                laid the golden eggs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Where was the inconvenience in waiting?</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was very sure that he would not escape.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, 
                putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical 
                personage.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks 
                to the brilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,-- 
                the mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his 
                prey. Javert gave that profound start.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the 
                formidable convict, he perceived that there were only three of 
                them, and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of 
                the Rue de Pontoise. One puts on gloves before grasping a thorn 
                cudgel.</p>
              <p> 　　This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult 
                with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily 
                divined, however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river 
                between his pursuers and himself.</p>
              <p> 　　He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound who puts 
                his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight 
                to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished 
                him with the information which he required:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you seen a man with a little girl?&quot; &quot;I 
                made him pay two sous,&quot; replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached 
                the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated 
                spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. 
                He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered 
                the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the sole 
                exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sure 
                of his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one 
                of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol 
                which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he 
                made a requisition on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such 
                games soldiers are aces.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best 
                of a wild boar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty 
                of dogs.</p>
              <p> 　　These combinations having been effected, feeling that Jean 
                Valjean was caught between the blind alley Genrot on the right, 
                his agent on the left, and himself, Javert, in the rear, he took 
                a pinch of snuff.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he began the game.</p>
              <p> 　　He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment; he allowed 
                his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, but desirous 
                of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy 
                at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating 
                over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider 
                which allows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the 
                mouse run.</p>
              <p> 　　Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,-- the obscure 
                movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a 
                delight this strangling is!</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was enjoying himself.</p>
              <p> 　　The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted. He was sure of 
                success; all he had to do now was to close his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible, 
                however vigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might 
                be.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all 
                the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves.</p>
              <p> 　　When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no 
                longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　His exasperation can be imagined.</p>
              <p> 　　He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus; 
                that agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not 
                seen the man pass.</p>
              <p> 　　It sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that 
                is to say, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, 
                and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, 
                and Desprez halt short.</p>
              <p> 　　In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims, &quot;It 
                was not a stag, but a sorcerer.&quot; Javert would have liked 
                to utter the same cry.</p>
              <p> 　　His disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.</p>
              <p> 　　It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with 
                Russia, that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, 
                that Caesar made mistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was 
                at fault in the war in Scythia, and that Javert blundered in this 
                campaign against Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of 
                the exconvict.</p>
              <p> 　　The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in 
                not arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was 
                wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in 
                the Rue de Pontoise.</p>
              <p> 　　He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the 
                full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly 
                useful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of 
                the dogs who deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too 
                cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the 
                convict.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, by taking too much thought as to how he should set 
                the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, alarmed the beast by 
                giving him wind of the dart, and so made him run. Above all, he 
                was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the 
                bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable and puerile game 
                of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thought himself 
                stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at the game 
                of the mouse and the lion.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, he reckoned himself as too weak, when he 
                judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement.</p>
              <p> 　　Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed 
                all these blunders, and none the less was one of the cleverest 
                and most correct spies that ever existed.</p>
              <p> 　　He was, in the full force of the term, what is called in venery 
                a knowing dog. But what is there that is perfect?</p>
              <p> 　　Great strategists have their eclipses.</p>
              <p> 　　The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest 
                ropes, of a multitude of strands.</p>
              <p> 　　Take the cable thread by thread, take all the petty determining 
                motives separately, and you can break them one after the other, 
                and you say, &quot;That is all there is of it!&quot; Braid them, 
                twist them together; the result is enormous:</p>
              <p> 　　it is Attila hesitating between Marcian on the east and Valentinian 
                on the west; it is Hannibal tarrying at Capua; it is Danton falling 
                asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.</p>
              <p> 　　However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean 
                Valjean had escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that 
                the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off, he established 
                sentinels, he organized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter 
                all that night.</p>
              <p> 　　The first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern 
                whose rope had been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him 
                astray, since it caused him to turn all his researches in the 
                direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot. In this blind alley there 
                were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds 
                adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. Jean Valjean evidently 
                must have fled in that direction.</p>
              <p> 　　The fact is, that had he penetrated a little further in the 
                Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he would probably have done so and have been 
                lost.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as 
                though he had been hunting for a needle.</p>
              <p> 　　At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and 
                returned to the Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police 
                spy who had been captured by a robber might have been. </p>

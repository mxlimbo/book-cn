              <p> 　　THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE</p>
              <p> 　　 From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of 
                the town, to a Fleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, 
                who let out &quot;horses and cabriolets as desired.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to 
                take the little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage 
                of the parish in which M. Madeleine resided.</p>
              <p> 　　The cure was, it was said, a worthy, respectable, and sensible 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when M. Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage 
                there was but one passer-by in the street, and this person noticed 
                this:</p>
              <p> 　　After the mayor had passed the priest's house he halted, stood 
                motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to the door 
                of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker.</p>
              <p> 　　He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then 
                he paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after 
                the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to 
                fall abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a 
                sort of haste which had not been apparent previously.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in 
                stitching a harness over.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Master Scaufflaire,&quot; he inquired, &quot;have you 
                a good horse?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor,&quot; said the Fleming, &quot;all my horses 
                are good.</p>
              <p> 　　What do you mean by a good horse?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a 
                day.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The deuce!&quot; said the Fleming.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Twenty leagues!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hitched to a cabriolet?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He must be able to set out again on the next day if 
                necessary.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To traverse the same road?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The deuce! the deuce!</p>
              <p> 　　And it is twenty leagues?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had 
                pencilled some figures.</p>
              <p> 　　He showed it to the Fleming.</p>
              <p> 　　The figures were 5, 6, 8 1/2.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;total, nineteen and a 
                half; as well say twenty leagues.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mr. Mayor,&quot; returned the Fleming, &quot;I have 
                just what you want. My little white horse--you may have seen him 
                pass occasionally; he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais.</p>
              <p> 　　He is full of fire. They wanted to make a saddle-horse of 
                him at first.</p>
              <p> 　　Bah!</p>
              <p> 　　He reared, he kicked, he laid everybody flat on the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　He was thought to be vicious, and no one knew what to do with 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage.</p>
              <p> 　　That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he 
                goes like the wind.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! indeed he must not be mounted.</p>
              <p> 　　It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse. Every one 
                has his ambition.</p>
              <p> 　　`Draw? Yes.</p>
              <p> 　　Carry?</p>
              <p> 　　No.' We must suppose that is what he said to himself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And he will accomplish the trip?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less 
                than eight hours. But here are the conditions.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;State them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the first place.</p>
              <p> 　　you will give him half an hour's breathing spell midway of 
                the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is eating 
                to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for 
                I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the 
                stable men than eaten by the horses.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Some one will be by.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the second place--is the cabriolet for Monsieur le 
                Maire?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without 
                baggage, in order not to overload the horse?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, 
                he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that 
                the oats are not stolen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is understood.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am to have thirty francs a day.</p>
              <p> 　　The days of rest to be paid for also--not a farthing less; 
                and the beast's food to be at Monsieur le Maire's expense.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid 
                them on the table.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here is the pay for two days in advance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too 
                heavy, and would fatigue the horse.</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury 
                that I own.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I consent to that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is light, but it has no cover.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That makes no difference to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle 
                of winter?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine did not reply.</p>
              <p> 　　The Fleming resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That it is very cold?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine preserved silence.</p>
              <p> 　　Master Scaufflaire continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That it may rain?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine raised his head and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door 
                to-morrow morning at half-past four o'clock.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of course, Monsieur le Maire,&quot; replied Scaufflaire; 
                then, scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, 
                he resumed with that careless air which the Flemings understand 
                so well how to mingle with their shrewdness:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But this is what I am thinking of now:</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur le Maire has not told me where he is going.</p>
              <p> 　　Where is Monsieur le Maire going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of 
                the conversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to 
                put the question.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are your horse's forelegs good?&quot; said M. Madeleine.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes, Monsieur le Maire.</p>
              <p> 　　You must hold him in a little when going down hill.</p>
              <p> 　　Are there many descends between here and the place whither 
                you are going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past 
                four o'clock to-morrow morning,&quot; replied M. Madeleine; and 
                he took his departure.</p>
              <p> 　　The Fleming remained &quot;utterly stupid,&quot; as he himself 
                said some time afterwards.</p>
              <p> 　　The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door 
                opened again; it was the mayor once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Scaufflaire,&quot; said he, &quot;at what sum 
                do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are 
                to let to me,-- the one bearing the other?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,&quot; 
                said the Fleming, with a broad smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So be it.</p>
              <p> 　　Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case.</p>
              <p> 　　You shall give me back the sum at my return.</p>
              <p> 　　At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here it is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the 
                room; and this time he did not return.</p>
              <p> 　　Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he 
                had not said a thousand francs.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred 
                crowns.</p>
              <p> 　　The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. 
                &quot;Where the devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They held counsel together.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is going to Paris,&quot; said the wife.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; said the husband.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, 
                and it lay on the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and 
                studied it. &quot;Five, six, eight and a half?</p>
              <p> 　　That must designate the posting relays.&quot; He turned to 
                his wife:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have found out.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin 
                to Saint-Pol, eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras.</p>
              <p> 　　He is going to Arras.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home.</p>
              <p> 　　He had taken the longest way to return from Master Scaufflaire's, 
                as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him, and 
                he had wished to avoid it.</p>
              <p> 　　He ascended to his room, and there he shut himself up, which 
                was a very simple act, since he liked to go to bed early.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the portress of the factory, who was, at the 
                same time, M. Madeleine's only servant, noticed that the latter's 
                light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she mentioned it 
                to the cashier when he came home, adding:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is Monsieur le Maire ill?</p>
              <p> 　　I thought he had a rather singular air.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine's 
                chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　He paid no heed to the portress's words, but went to bed and 
                to sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he 
                had heard a noise above his head.</p>
              <p> 　　He listened; it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though 
                some one were walking in the room above him.</p>
              <p> 　　He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine's 
                step.</p>
              <p> 　　This struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in 
                M. Madeleine's chamber until he rose in the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that 
                of a cupboard being opened, and then shut again; then a piece 
                of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; then the step 
                began again.</p>
              <p> 　　The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and staring; and 
                through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted 
                window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the 
                rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine's chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　The reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire 
                which had been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame 
                was not shown, which indicated that the window was wide open.</p>
              <p> 　　The fact that this window was open in such cold weather was 
                surprising.</p>
              <p> 　　The cashier fell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　The same step was still passing slowly and regularly back 
                and forth overhead.</p>
              <p> 　　The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was 
                pale and peaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. 
                The window was still open.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine's room.</p>

              <p> 　　CLOISTERED</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean 
                Valjean's daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and 
                then, she would not have said anything in any case.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have just observed, nothing trains children to silence 
                like unhappiness. Cosette had suffered so much, that she feared 
                everything, even to speak or to breathe.</p>
              <p> 　　A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had 
                been with Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　She speedily became accustomed to the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　Only she regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so.</p>
              <p> 　　Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean: &quot;Father, 
                if I had known, I would have brought her away with me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, 
                to don the garb of the pupils of the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the 
                garments which she laid aside. This was the same mourning suit 
                which he had made her put on when she had quitted the Thenardiers' 
                inn.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean locked up 
                these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a quantity 
                of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in 
                a little valise which he found means of procuring. He set this 
                valise on a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key 
                about his person.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father,&quot; Cosette asked him one day, &quot;what 
                is there in that box which smells so good?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good 
                action, in addition to the glory which we just mentioned, and 
                of which he knew nothing; in the first place it made him happy; 
                next, he had much less work, since it was shared.</p>
              <p> 　　Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he found the presence 
                of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three times as much 
                as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more luxurious 
                manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.</p>
              <p> 　　The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean 
                Valjean the other Fauvent.</p>
              <p> 　　If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert's glance, 
                they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand 
                to be done outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always 
                the elder Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who 
                went, and never the other; but whether it is that eyes constantly 
                fixed on God know not how to spy, or whether they were, by preference, 
                occupied in keeping watch on each other, they paid no heed to 
                this.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close 
                and did not stir out.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.</p>
              <p> 　　This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded 
                by gulfs.</p>
              <p> 　　Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw 
                enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, 
                and Cosette enough to remain happy.</p>
              <p> 　　A very sweet life began for him.</p>
              <p> 　　He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company 
                with Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in existence 
                in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three chambers, 
                all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls.</p>
              <p> 　　The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean 
                had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　The walls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to 
                the two nails whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist 
                bank-note of '93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, 
                and of which the following is an exact facsimile:--</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                {GRAPHIC HERE}</p>
              <p> 　　<br>
                This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall 
                by the preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the 
                convent, and whose place Fauchelevent had taken.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself 
                very useful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly 
                found himself a gardener once more.</p>
              <p> 　　It will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and 
                receipts for agriculture.</p>
              <p> 　　He turned these to advantage. Almost all the trees in the 
                orchard were ungrafted, and wild. He budded them and made them 
                produce excellent fruit.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. 
                As the sisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made 
                comparisons and adored him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered 
                the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed 
                out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he 
                afforded Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　The joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, 
                far from growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us 
                more radiant than ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched 
                her running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished 
                her laugh from that of the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　For Cosette laughed now.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette's face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. 
                The gloom had disappeared from it.</p>
              <p> 　　A smile is the same as sunshine; it banishes winter from the 
                human countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean 
                Valjean gazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he 
                rose to look at the windows of her dormitory.</p>
              <p> 　　God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like 
                Cosette, to uphold and complete the Bishop's work in Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　It is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side.</p>
              <p> 　　A bridge built by the devil exists there.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably near 
                that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the 
                convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself 
                only to the Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had 
                remained humble; but for some time past he had been comparing 
                himself to men in general, and pride was beginning to spring up. 
                Who knows?</p>
              <p> 　　He might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred.</p>
              <p> 　　The convent stopped him on that downward path.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. 
                In his youth, in what had been for him the beginning of his life, 
                and later on, quite recently again, he had beheld another,-- a 
                frightful place, a terrible place, whose severities had always 
                appeared to him the iniquity of justice, and the crime of the 
                law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the cloister; and when he 
                meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys, and that he 
                now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, he confronted 
                the two in his own mind with anxiety.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly 
                descended the endless spirals of revery.</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled his former companions:</p>
              <p> 　　how wretched they were; they rose at dawn, and toiled until 
                night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they lay on camp beds, 
                where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick, in 
                rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the 
                year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed, 
                as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a 
                woollen carter's blouse on their backs when it was very cold; 
                they drank no wine, and ate no meat, except when they went on 
                &quot;fatigue duty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They lived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted, 
                after a manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with 
                lowered voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.</p>
              <p> 　　Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his 
                eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, 
                with lowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the 
                world, not with their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with 
                their shoulders lacerated with their discipline.</p>
              <p> 　　Their names, also, had vanished from among men; they no longer 
                existed except under austere appellations. They never ate meat 
                and they never drank wine; they often remained until evening without 
                food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a black shroud, 
                of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in winter, without 
                the power to add or subtract anything from it; without having 
                even, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment 
                or the woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore 
                serge chemises which gave them fever.</p>
              <p> 　　They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold, 
                but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept, not on 
                mattresses two inches thick, but on straw.</p>
              <p> 　　And finally, they were not even allowed their sleep; every 
                night, after a day of toil, they were obliged, in the weariness 
                of their first slumber, at the moment when they were falling sound 
                asleep and beginning to get warm, to rouse themselves, to rise 
                and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel, with their 
                knees on the stones.</p>
              <p> 　　On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain 
                for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, 
                with face upon the pavement, and arms outstretched in the form 
                of a cross.</p>
              <p> 　　The others were men; these were women.</p>
              <p> 　　What had those men done?</p>
              <p> 　　They had stolen, violated, pillaged, murdered, assassinated.</p>
              <p> 　　They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners, incendiaries, 
                murderers, parricides.</p>
              <p> 　　What had these women done?</p>
              <p> 　　They had done nothing whatever.</p>
              <p> 　　On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, 
                sensuality, homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of 
                crime; on the other, one thing only, innocence.</p>
              <p> 　　Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious 
                assumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing 
                something of heaven through holiness.</p>
              <p> 　　On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged 
                in whispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. 
                And what crimes!</p>
              <p> 　　And what faults!</p>
              <p> 　　On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. 
                On the one hand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under 
                the range of cannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken 
                victims; on the other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same 
                hearth. There, darkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled 
                with gleams of light, and of gleams full of radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance 
                possible, a legal limit always in sight, and then, escape.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second, perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity 
                of the future, that faint light of liberty which men call death.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, 
                chained by faith.</p>
              <p> 　　What flowed from the first?</p>
              <p> 　　An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth, hatred, desperate 
                viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, a sarcasm against 
                heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　What results flowed from the second?</p>
              <p> 　　Blessings and love.</p>
              <p> 　　And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two 
                species of beings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the 
                same work, expiation.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; 
                that personal expiation, the expiation for one's self.</p>
              <p> 　　But he did not understand that of these last, that of creatures 
                without reproach and without stain, and he trembled as he asked 
                himself: The expiation of what?</p>
              <p> 　　What expiation?</p>
              <p> 　　A voice within his conscience replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The most divine of human generosities, the expiation 
                for others.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; 
                we place ourselves at Jean Valjean's point of view, and we translate 
                his impressions.</p>
              <p> 　　Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the 
                highest possible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons 
                men their faults, and which expiates in their stead; servitude 
                submitted to, torture accepted, punishment claimed by souls which 
                have not sinned, for the sake of sparing it to souls which have 
                fallen; the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of God, 
                but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character; 
                sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are 
                punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.</p>
              <p> 　　And he remembered that he had dared to murmur!</p>
              <p> 　　Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the 
                grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, 
                and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those 
                who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only 
                in blasphemy, and that he, wretch that he was, had shaken his 
                fist at God.</p>
              <p> 　　There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate 
                deeply, like a warning whisper from Providence itself:</p>
              <p> 　　the scaling of that wall, the passing of those barriers, the 
                adventure accepted even at the risk of death, the painful and 
                difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which he had made to 
                escape from that other place of expiation, he had made in order 
                to gain entrance into this one.</p>
              <p> 　　Was this a symbol of his destiny?</p>
              <p> 　　This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance 
                to that other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived 
                an idea of anything similar.</p>
              <p> 　　Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars--to guard whom?</p>
              <p> 　　Angels.</p>
              <p> 　　These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now 
                beheld once more around lambs.</p>
              <p> 　　This was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and 
                yet, it was still more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless 
                than the other.</p>
              <p> 　　These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. 
                A cold, harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed 
                the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher 
                and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　When he thought on these things, all that was within him was 
                lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity.</p>
              <p> 　　In these meditations, his pride vanished.</p>
              <p> 　　He scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways; he felt 
                his pettiness, and many a time he wept.</p>
              <p> 　　All that had entered into his life for the last six months 
                had led him back towards the Bishop's holy injunctions; Cosette 
                through love, the convent through humility.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the 
                garden was deserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle 
                of the walk which skirted the chapel, in front of the window through 
                which he had gazed on the night of his arrival, and turned towards 
                the spot where, as he knew, the sister was making reparation, 
                prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those 
                fragrant flowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those 
                grave and simple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated 
                him, and little by little, his soul became compounded of silence 
                like the cloister, of perfume like the flowers, of simplicity 
                like the women, of joy like the children.</p>
              <p> 　　And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God 
                which had received him in succession at two critical moments in 
                his life:</p>
              <p> 　　the first, when all doors were closed and when human society 
                rejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again 
                set out in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; 
                and that, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed 
                into crime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and 
                more.</p>
              <p> 　　Many years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.</p>

              <p> 　　NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH</p>
              <p> 　　In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge 
                there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved 
                the memory of a worthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention 
                him with complaisance.</p>
              <p> 　　This good man was old when they were young. This silhouette 
                has not yet entirely disappeared--for those who regard with melancholy 
                that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past-- from the 
                labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under 
                Louis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were appended 
                exactly as in our day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have 
                received the names of all the capitals of Europe; a progression, 
                by the way, in which progress is visible.</p>
              <p> 　　M.Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, 
                was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed, 
                simply because they have lived a long time, and who are strange 
                because they formerly resembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. 
                He was a peculiar old man, and in very truth, a man of another 
                age, the real, complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth 
                century, who wore his good, old bourgeoisie with the air with 
                which marquises wear their marquisates.</p>
              <p> 　　He was over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he talked 
                loudly, saw clearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored.</p>
              <p> 　　He had all thirty-two of his teeth. He only wore spectacles 
                when he read.</p>
              <p> 　　He was of an amorous disposition, but declared that, for the 
                last ten years, he had wholly and decidedly renounced women.</p>
              <p> 　　He could no longer please, he said; he did not add:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am too old,&quot; but:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am too poor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He said: &quot;If I were not ruined--Heee!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All he had left, in fact, was an income of about fifteen thousand 
                francs.</p>
              <p> 　　His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred 
                thousand livres income for mistresses.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not belong, as the reader will perceive, to that puny 
                variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying 
                all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial 
                old man had always had good health.</p>
              <p> 　　He was superficial, rapid, easily angered.</p>
              <p> 　　He flew into a passion at everything, generally quite contrary 
                to all reason.</p>
              <p> 　　When contradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he 
                had done in the great century. He had a daughter over fifty years 
                of age, and unmarried, whom he chastised severely with his tongue, 
                when in a rage, and whom he would have liked to whip.</p>
              <p> 　　She seemed to him to be eight years old. He boxed his servants' 
                ears soundly, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! carogne!&quot; One of his oaths was:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!&quot; He 
                had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved every 
                day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him, being jealous 
                of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty and coquettish 
                barberess.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things, 
                and declared that he was extremely sagacious; here is one of his 
                sayings:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have, in truth, some penetration; I am able to say 
                when a flea bites me, from what woman it came.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The words which he uttered the most frequently were:</p>
              <p> 　　the sensible man, and nature.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which 
                our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his 
                own fashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: &quot;Nature,&quot; 
                he said, &quot;in order that civilization may have a little of 
                everything, gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism. 
                Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale. 
                The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. 
                The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.</p>
              <p> 　　They do not eat men, they crunch them; or, magicians that 
                they are, they transform them into oysters and swallow them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Caribbeans leave only the bones, they leave only the shell.</p>
              <p> 　　Such are our morals.</p>
              <p> 　　We do not devour, we gnaw; we do not exterminate, we claw.&quot;</p>

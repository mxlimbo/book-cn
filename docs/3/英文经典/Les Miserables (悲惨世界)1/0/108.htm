              <p> 　　TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE</p>
              <p> 　　On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still 
                by Cosette's bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for 
                her to wake.</p>
              <p> 　　Some new thing had come into his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years 
                he had been alone in the world.</p>
              <p> 　　He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In the prison 
                he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy.</p>
              <p> 　　The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister 
                and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far-off 
                memory which had finally almost completely vanished; he had made 
                every effort to find them, and not having been able to find them, 
                he had forgotten them.</p>
              <p> 　　Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his 
                youth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, 
                carried her off, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed 
                towards that child.</p>
              <p> 　　He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled 
                with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what 
                it meant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which 
                begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.</p>
              <p> 　　Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!</p>
              <p> 　　Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of 
                age, all that might have been love in the whole course of his 
                life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. 
                The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; 
                Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise.</p>
              <p> 　　The early days passed in this dazzled state.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become 
                another being, poor little thing!</p>
              <p> 　　She was so little when her mother left her, that she no longer 
                remembered her.</p>
              <p> 　　Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, 
                which cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had not 
                succeeded.</p>
              <p> 　　All had repulsed her,-- the Thenardiers, their children, other 
                children.</p>
              <p> 　　She had loved the dog, and he had died, after which nothing 
                and nobody would have anything to do with her.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, 
                that, at eight years of age, her heart was cold. It was not her 
                fault; it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked; alas! 
                it was the possibility.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus, from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking 
                powers loved this kind man.</p>
              <p> 　　She felt that which she had never felt before--a sensation 
                of expansion.</p>
              <p> 　　The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old 
                or poor; she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought 
                the hovel pretty.</p>
              <p> 　　These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy.</p>
              <p> 　　The novelty of the earth and of life counts for something 
                here.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness 
                on a garret. We all have in our past a delightful garret.</p>
              <p> 　　Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf 
                between Jean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. 
                Destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power 
                these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. 
                One, in fact, completed the other.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette's instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean's instinct 
                sought a child.</p>
              <p> 　　To meet was to find each other.</p>
              <p> 　　At the mysterious moment when their hands touched, they were 
                welded together.</p>
              <p> 　　When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized 
                each other as necessary to each other, and embraced each other 
                closely.</p>
              <p> 　　Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute 
                sense, we may say that, separated from every one by the walls 
                of the tomb, Jean Valjean was the widower, and Cosette was the 
                orphan: this situation caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette's 
                father after a celestial fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette 
                in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean 
                grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. 
                The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been 
                the advent of God.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.</p>
              <p> 　　There he seemed perfectly secure.</p>
              <p> 　　The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, 
                was the one whose window opened on the boulevard.</p>
              <p> 　　This being the only window in the house, no neighbors' glances 
                were to be feared from across the way or at the side.</p>
              <p> 　　The ground-floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse, 
                served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communication 
                existed between it and the first story.</p>
              <p> 　　It was separated by the flooring, which had neither traps 
                nor stairs, and which formed the diaphragm of the building, as 
                it were.</p>
              <p> 　　The first story contained, as we have said, numerous chambers 
                and several attics, only one of which was occupied by the old 
                woman who took charge of Jean Valjean's housekeeping; all the 
                rest was uninhabited.</p>
              <p> 　　It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal 
                lodger, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, 
                who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve.</p>
              <p> 　　He had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means 
                who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was coming there to 
                live with his little daughter. He had paid her six months in advance, 
                and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and 
                dressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who had 
                lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the 
                evening of their arrival.</p>
              <p> 　　Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that 
                hovel.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak.</p>
              <p> 　　Children have their morning song as well as birds.</p>
              <p> 　　It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red 
                hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it.</p>
              <p> 　　The poor child, who was used to being beaten, did not know 
                the meaning of this, and ran away in confusion.</p>
              <p> 　　At times she became serious and stared at her little black 
                gown. Cosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning.</p>
              <p> 　　She had emerged from misery, and she was entering into life.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, as he made the child spell, he remembered that 
                it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read 
                in prison.</p>
              <p> 　　This idea had ended in teaching a child to read.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some 
                one who was not man, and he became absorbed in revery.</p>
              <p> 　　Good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones.</p>
              <p> 　　To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted 
                nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence.</p>
              <p> 　　And then he talked of her mother, and he made her pray.</p>
              <p> 　　She called him father, and knew no other name for him.</p>
              <p> 　　He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her 
                doll, and in listening to her prattle.</p>
              <p> 　　Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be full of interest; 
                men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproached any one 
                in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very 
                old man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole future 
                stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming 
                light.</p>
              <p> 　　The best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts.</p>
              <p> 　　At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be 
                ugly.</p>
              <p> 　　This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, 
                at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love 
                Cosette, it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this 
                encouragement in order that he might persevere in well-doing. 
                He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society 
                under a new aspect-- incomplete aspects, which unfortunately only 
                exhibited one side of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up 
                in Fantine, and public authority as personified in Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　He had returned to prison, this time for having done right; 
                he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were overpowering 
                him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a temporary 
                eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant; 
                but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim.</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of 
                growing discouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew 
                strong again.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He protected her, and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, 
                she could walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue 
                in virtue.</p>
              <p> 　　He was that child's stay, and she was his prop.</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny!</p>

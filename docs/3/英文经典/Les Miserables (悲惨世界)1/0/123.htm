              <p> 　　 One is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; 
                a novice for four.</p>
              <p> 　　It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier 
                than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The Bernardines-Benedictines 
                of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their order.</p>
              <p> 　　In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown 
                macerations, of which they must never speak.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed 
                in her handsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her 
                hair is brushed until it shines, and curled.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she prostrates herself; a great black veil is thrown 
                over her, and the office for the dead is sung.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the nuns separate into two files; one file passes close 
                to her, saying in plaintive accents, &quot;Our sister is dead&quot;; 
                and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy, &quot;Our sister 
                is alive in Jesus Christ!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school 
                was attached to the convent--a boarding-school for young girls 
                of noble and mostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked 
                Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire and de Belissen, and an English 
                girl bearing the illustrious Catholic name of Talbot.</p>
              <p> 　　These young girls, reared by these nuns between four walls, 
                grew up with a horror of the world and of the age.</p>
              <p> 　　One of them said to us one day, &quot;The sight of the street 
                pavement made me shudder from head to foot.&quot; They were dressed 
                in blue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or 
                of copper on their breast.</p>
              <p> 　　On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha's 
                day, they were permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, 
                to dress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice 
                of Saint-Benoit for a whole day.</p>
              <p> 　　In the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them 
                their black garments.</p>
              <p> 　　This seemed profane, and the prioress forbade it.</p>
              <p> 　　Only the novices were permitted to lend. It is remarkable 
                that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt, in 
                the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order 
                to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine 
                happiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply 
                amused themselves with it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was new; it gave them a change.</p>
              <p> 　　Candid reasons of childhood, which do not, however, succeed 
                in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy 
                water sprinkler in one's hand and standing for hours together 
                singing hard enough for four in front of a reading-desk.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, 
                to all the practices of the convent.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a certain young woman who entered the world, and 
                who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking 
                herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any one 
                knocked at her door, &quot;forever!&quot; Like the nuns, the pupils 
                saw their relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did 
                not obtain permission to embrace them. The following illustrates 
                to what a degree severity on that point was carried.</p>
              <p> 　　One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, who 
                was accompanied by a little sister three years of age. The young 
                girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace her sister. Impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted to 
                pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it. 
                This was almost indignantly refused.</p>

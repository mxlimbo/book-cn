              <p> 　　THE LAST SQUARE</p>
              <p> 　　 Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream 
                of the defeat, as rocks in running water, held their own until 
                night. Night came, death also; they awaited that double shadow, 
                and, invincible, allowed themselves to be enveloped therein. Each 
                regiment, isolated from the rest, and having no bond with the 
                army, now shattered in every part, died alone.</p>
              <p> 　　They had taken up position for this final action, some on 
                the heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. 
                There, abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares endured 
                their death-throes in formidable fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, died with them.</p>
              <p> 　　At twilight, towards nine o'clock in the evening, one of them 
                was left at the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that 
                fatal valley, at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers 
                had ascended, now inundated by the masses of the English, under 
                the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry, under 
                a frightful density of projectiles, this square fought on.</p>
              <p> 　　It was commanded by an obscure officer named Cambronne.</p>
              <p> 　　At each discharge, the square diminished and replied.</p>
              <p> 　　It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continually 
                contracting its four walls.</p>
              <p> 　　The fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance, 
                listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever-decreasing thunder.</p>
              <p> 　　When this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing 
                was left of their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets 
                all gone, were no longer anything but clubs, when the heap of 
                corpses was larger than the group of survivors, there reigned 
                among the conquerors, around those men dying so sublimely, a sort 
                of sacred terror, and the English artillery, taking breath, became 
                silent.</p>
              <p> 　　This furnished a sort of respite.</p>
              <p> 　　These combatants had around them something in the nature of 
                a swarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black 
                profiles of cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, 
                the colossal death's-head, which the heroes saw constantly through 
                the smoke, in the depths of the battle, advanced upon them and 
                gazed at them.</p>
              <p> 　　Through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces 
                being loaded; the matches all lighted, like the eyes of tigers 
                at night, formed a circle round their heads; all the lintstocks 
                of the English batteries approached the cannons, and then, with 
                emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended above these men, 
                an English general, Colville according to some, Maitland according 
                to others, shouted to them, &quot;Surrender, brave Frenchmen!&quot; 
                Cambronne replied, &quot;-----.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　{EDITOR'S COMMENTARY:Another edition of this book has the 
                word &quot;Merde!&quot; in lieu of the ----- above.}</p>

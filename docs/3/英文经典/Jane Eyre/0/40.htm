          <tr> 
            <td>READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson 
              and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went 
              into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the 
              dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said- 
              <p>'Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.' The 
                housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic 
                order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate 
                a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having 
                one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently 
                stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and 
                she did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair 
                of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang 
                suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives 
                also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again 
                over the roast, said only- </p>
              <p>'Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!' </p>
              <p>A short time after she pursued- 'I seed you go out with the master, 
                but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;' and she 
                basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear 
                to ear. </p>
              <p>'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr. Edward' 
                (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was 
                the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian 
                name)- 'I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he 
                would not wait long neither: and he's done right, for aught I 
                know. I wish you joy, Miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock. 
              </p>
              <p>'Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary 
                this.' I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting 
                to hear more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that 
                sanctum some time after, I caught the words- </p>
              <p>'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' 
                And again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal 
                and varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody 
                may see that.' </p>
              <p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what 
                I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana 
                and Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that 
                she would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then 
                she would come and see me. </p>
              <p>'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr. Rochester, 
                when I read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, 
                for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only 
                fade over your grave or mine.' </p>
              <p>How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered 
                the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he 
                wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name 
                or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though 
                very serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, 
                correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am 
                not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind 
                earthly things. </p>
              <p>You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader? 
                I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to 
                go and see her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic 
                joy at beholding me again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: 
                she said she was not happy. I found the rules of the establishment 
                were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of 
                her age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess 
                once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares 
                were now required by another- my husband needed them all. So I 
                sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and 
                near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her 
                home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything 
                that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her 
                new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in 
                her studies. As she grew up, a sound English education corrected 
                in a great measure her French defects; and when she left school, 
                I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, 
                and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, 
                she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had 
                it in my power to offer her. </p>
              <p>My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience 
                of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those 
                whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and 
                I have done. </p>
              <p>I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live 
                entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself 
                supremely blest- blest beyond what language can express; because 
                I am my husband's life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever 
                nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his 
                bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's 
                society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the 
                pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, 
                we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once as 
                free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, 
                all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and 
                an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all 
                his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character-perfect 
                concord is the result. </p>
              <p>Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union: 
                perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near- that 
                knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still 
                his right hand. Literally, I was (what he often called me) the 
                apple of his eye. He saw nature- he saw books through me; and 
                never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into 
                words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam- 
                of the landscape before us; of the weather round us- and impressing 
                by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye. 
                Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of conducting 
                him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to 
                be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most 
                exquisite, even though sad- because he claimed these services 
                without painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, 
                that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt 
                I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge 
                my sweetest wishes. </p>
              <p>One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter 
                to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said- </p>
              <p>'Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?' </p>
              <p>I had a gold watch-chain: I answered 'Yes.' </p>
              <p>'And have you a pale-blue dress on?' </p>
              <p>I had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied 
                the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that 
                now he was sure of it. </p>
              <p>He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; 
                and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot 
                now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he 
                can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no 
                longer a blank to him- the earth no longer a void. When his first-born 
                was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited 
                his own eyes, as they once were- large, brilliant, and black. 
                On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that 
                God had tempered judgment with mercy. </p>
              <p>My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those 
                we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both 
                married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and 
                we go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a 
                gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college 
                friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, 
                worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton 
                love their wives, and are loved by them. </p>
              <p>As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He 
                entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. 
                A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks 
                and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and 
                zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful 
                way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of 
                creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; 
                he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior 
                Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of 
                Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for 
                Christ, when he says- 'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny 
                himself, and take up his cross and follow me.' His is the ambition 
                of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first 
                rank of those who are redeemed from the earth- who stand without 
                fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories 
                of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful. </p>
              <p>St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto 
                sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious 
                sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him 
                drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine 
                joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. 
                I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that 
                the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the 
                joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will 
                darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart 
                will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. 
                His own words are a pledge of this- </p>
              <p>'My Master,' he says, 'has forewarned me. Daily He announces 
                more distinctly,- &quot;Surely I come quickly!&quot; and hourly 
                I more eagerly respond,- &quot;Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!&quot;' 
              </p>

            <td>A SPLENDID Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so 
              radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even 
              singly, our wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days 
              had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, 
              and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all 
              got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads 
              white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, 
              full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue 
              of the cleared meadows between. 
              <p>On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries 
                in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched 
                her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden. </p>
              <p>It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:- 'Day its fervid 
                fires had wasted,' and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched 
                summit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state- pure of the 
                pomp of clouds- spread a solemn purple, burning with the light 
                of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, 
                and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half 
                heaven. The east had its own charm of fine deep blue, and its 
                own modest gem, a rising and solitary star: soon it would boast 
                the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon. </p>
              <p>I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent- 
                that of a cigar- stole from some window; I saw the library casement 
                open a hand-breadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went 
                apart into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered 
                and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: 
                a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the 
                other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom 
                was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding 
                walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, 
                circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one 
                could wander unseen. While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, 
                such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade 
                for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the 
                upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now 
                rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed-not 
                by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance. 
              </p>
              <p>Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long 
                been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent 
                is neither of shrub nor flower; it is- I know it well- it is Mr. 
                Rochester's cigar. I look round and I listen. I see trees laden 
                with ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half 
                a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; 
                but that perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket 
                leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I 
                step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will 
                soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see 
                me. </p>
              <p>But no- eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique 
                garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree 
                branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they 
                are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping 
                towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or 
                to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming 
                by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees 
                it, and bends to examine it. </p>
              <p>'Now, he has his back towards me,' thought I, 'and he is occupied 
                too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.' </p>
              <p>I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel 
                might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard 
                or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged 
                him. 'I shall get by very well,' I meditated. As I crossed his 
                shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen 
                high, he said quietly, without turning- </p>
              <p>'Jane, come and look at this fellow.' </p>
              <p>I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind- could his shadow 
                feel? I started at first, and then I approached him. </p>
              <p>'Look at his wings,' said he, 'he reminds me rather of a West 
                Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover 
                in England; there! he is flown.' </p>
              <p>The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. 
                Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said- 
              </p>
              <p>'Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the 
                house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is 
                thus at meeting with moonrise.' </p>
              <p>It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt 
                enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in 
                framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, 
                when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to 
                get me out of painful embarrassment. I did not like to walk at 
                this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but 
                I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him. I followed 
                with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means 
                of extrication; but he himself looked so composed and so grave 
                also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil- if 
                evil existent or prospective there was- seemed to lie with me 
                only; his mind was unconscious and quiet. </p>
              <p>'Jane,' he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly 
                strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, 
                'Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?' </p>
              <p>'Yes, sir.' </p>
              <p>'You must have become in some degree attached to the house,- 
                you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of 
                the organ of Adhesiveness?' </p>
              <p>'I am attached to it, indeed.' </p>
              <p>'And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have 
                acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, 
                too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?' </p>
              <p>'Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.' 
              </p>
              <p>'And would be sorry to part with them?' </p>
              <p>'Yes.' </p>
              <p>'Pity!' he said, and sighed and paused. 'It is always the way 
                of events in this life,' he continued presently: 'no sooner have 
                you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls 
                out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.' 
              </p>
              <p>'Must I move on, sir?' I asked. 'Must I leave Thornfield?' </p>
              <p>'I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed 
                you must.' </p>
              <p>This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me. </p>
              <p>'Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.' 
              </p>

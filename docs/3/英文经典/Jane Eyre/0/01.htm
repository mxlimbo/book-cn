            <td> A PREFACE to the first edition of Jane Eyre being unnecessary, 
              I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment 
              and miscellaneous remark. 
              <p>My thanks are due in three quarters. </p>
              <p>To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain 
                tale with few pretensions. </p>
              <p>To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened 
                to an obscure aspirant. </p>
              <p>To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their 
                practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown 
                and unrecommended Author. </p>
              <p>The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, 
                and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: 
                so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only 
                large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling 
                stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, 
                I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart. </p>
              <p>Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and 
                approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I 
                know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous 
                or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre: 
                in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect 
                in each protest against bigotry- that parent of crime- an insult 
                to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such 
                doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of 
                certain simple truths. </p>
              <p>Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. 
                To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask 
                from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand 
                to the Crown of Thorns. </p>
              <p>These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as 
                distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: 
                they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken 
                for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and 
                magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming 
                creed of Christ. There is- I repeat it- a difference; and it is 
                a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line 
                of separation between them. </p>
              <p>The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it 
                has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make 
                external show pass for sterling worth- to let white-washed walls 
                vouch for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise 
                and expose- to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it- 
                to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate 
                as it will, it is indebted to him. </p>
              <p>Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning 
                him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaanah 
                better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but 
                stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel. 
              </p>
              <p>There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to 
                tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great 
                ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned 
                Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with 
                a power as prophet-like and as vital- a mien as dauntless and 
                as daring. Is the satirist of Vanity Fair admired in high places? 
                I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls 
                the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand 
                of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time- they or 
                their seed might yet escape a fatal Ramoth-Gilead. </p>
              <p>Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, 
                because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more 
                unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I 
                regard him as the first social regenerator of the day- as the 
                very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude 
                the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on 
                his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the 
                terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like 
                Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles 
                Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, 
                but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attractive, 
                but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the 
                mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud 
                does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have 
                alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him- if he will accept the 
                tribute of a total stranger- I have dedicated this second edition 
                of Jane Eyre. </p>

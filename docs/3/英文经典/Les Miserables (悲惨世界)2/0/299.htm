              <p> 　　A DRINKER IS A BABBLER </p>
              <p> 　　What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the 
                insurrections of the soul?</p>
              <p> 　　Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean 
                at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every 
                sort of gulf had opened again within him.</p>
              <p> 　　He also was trembling, like Paris, on the brink of an obscure 
                and formidable revolution. A few hours had sufficed to bring this 
                about.</p>
              <p> 　　His destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with 
                gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　Of him also, as well as of Paris, it might have been said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Two principles are face to face.</p>
              <p> 　　The white angel and the black angel are about to seize each 
                other on the bridge of the abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　Which of the two will hurl the other over?</p>
              <p> 　　Who will carry the day?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean, 
                accompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in 
                the Rue de l'Homme Arme.</p>
              <p> 　　A change awaited him there.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort 
                at resistance.</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time since they had lived side by side, Cosette's 
                will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct, and 
                had been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There 
                had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. 
                The abrupt advice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave your house,&quot; hurled at Jean Valjean by a 
                stranger, had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. 
                He thought that he had been traced and followed.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had been obliged to give way.</p>
              <p> 　　Both had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme without opening 
                their lips, and without uttering a word, each being absorbed in 
                his own personal preoccupation; Jean Valjean so uneasy that he 
                did not notice Cosette's sadness, Cosette so sad that she did 
                not notice Jean Valjean's uneasiness.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he 
                had never done in his previous absences.</p>
              <p> 　　He perceived the possibility of not returning to the Rue Plumet, 
                and he could neither leave Toussaint behind nor confide his secret 
                to her.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy.</p>
              <p> 　　Treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　Now Toussaint, as though she had been destined to be Jean 
                Valjean's servant, was not curious. She stammered in her peasant 
                dialect of Barneville:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no affair of 
                mine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost 
                a flight, Jean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little 
                embalmed valise, baptized by Cosette &quot;the inseparable.&quot; 
                Full trunks would have required porters, and porters are witnesses. 
                A fiacre had been summoned to the door on the Rue de Babylone, 
                and they had taken their departure.</p>
              <p> 　　It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission 
                to pack up a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. 
                Cosette had taken only her portfolio and her blotting-book.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the 
                mystery of this departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of 
                the Rue Plumet only at dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to 
                write her note to Marius. They had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme 
                Arme after night had fully fallen.</p>
              <p> 　　They had gone to bed in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　The lodgings in the Rue de l'Homme Arme were situated on a 
                back court, on the second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, 
                a dining-room and a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a 
                garret where there was a folding-bed, and which fell to Toussaint's 
                share. The dining-room was an antechamber as well, and separated 
                the two bedrooms.</p>
              <p> 　　The apartment was provided with all necessary utensils.</p>
              <p> 　　People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; 
                human nature is so constituted.</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'Homme Arme when 
                his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There are 
                soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　An obscure street, peaceable inhabitants.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity 
                in that alley of ancient Paris, which is so narrow that it is 
                barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts, 
                which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city, dimly 
                lighted at mid-day, and is, so to speak, incapable of emotions 
                between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold their 
                peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant 
                oblivion in that street.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there.</p>
              <p> 　　How could he be found there?</p>
              <p> 　　His first care was to place the inseparable beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　He slept well.</p>
              <p> 　　Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the following 
                morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought the 
                dining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an 
                old round table, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, 
                a dilapidated arm-chair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered 
                with Toussaint's packages.</p>
              <p> 　　In one of these packages Jean Valjean's uniform of a National 
                Guard was visible through a rent.</p>
              <p> 　　As for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her 
                room, and did not make her appearance until evening.</p>
              <p> 　　About five o'clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and 
                busying herself with the tiny establishment, set on the table 
                a cold chicken, which Cosette, out of deference to her father, 
                consented to glance at.</p>
              <p> 　　That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick 
                headache, had bade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself 
                up in her chamber. Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken 
                with a good appetite, and with his elbows on the table, having 
                gradually recovered his serenity, had regained possession of his 
                sense of security.</p>
              <p> 　　While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice 
                or thrice, noticed in a confused way, Toussaint's stammering words 
                as she said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting 
                in Paris.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid 
                no heed to it.</p>
              <p> 　　To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began 
                to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the 
                door, growing ever more serene.</p>
              <p> 　　With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his 
                thoughts. Not that he was troubled by this headache, a little 
                nervous crisis, a young girl's fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, 
                there would be nothing left of it in a day or two; but he meditated 
                on the future, and, as was his habit, he thought of it with pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　After all, he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming 
                its course. At certain hours, everything seems impossible, at 
                others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in the midst 
                of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the bad ones, 
                as day follows night, by virtue of that law of succession and 
                of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, and which 
                superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where 
                he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had been 
                troubling him for some time past. This very fact, that he had 
                seen many shadows, made him begin to perceive a little azure.</p>
              <p> 　　To have quitted the Rue Plumet without complications or incidents 
                was one good step already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wise 
                to go abroad, if only for a few months, and to set out for London.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, they would go.</p>
              <p> 　　What difference did it make to him whether he was in France 
                or in England, provided he had Cosette beside him?</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was his nation.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette sufficed for his happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, 
                did not suffice for Cosette's happiness, that idea which had formerly 
                been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness, did not even present 
                itself to his mind. He was in a state of collapse from all his 
                past sufferings, and he was fully entered on optimism.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was by his side, she seemed to be his; an optical 
                illusion which every one has experienced. He arranged in his own 
                mind, with all sorts of felicitous devices, his departure for 
                England with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity reconstituted 
                wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his revery.</p>
              <p> 　　As he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly 
                encountered something strange.</p>
              <p> 　　In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, 
                he saw the four lines which follow:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out 
                immediately. We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, 
                No. 7. In a week we shall be in England.</p>
              <p> 　　COSETTE.</p>
              <p> 　　June 4th.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the 
                sideboard in front of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her 
                agony of grief, had forgotten it and left it there, without even 
                observing that she had left it wide open, and open at precisely 
                the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she 
                had penned, and which she had given in charge of the young workman 
                in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been printed off on the blotter.</p>
              <p> 　　The mirror reflected the writing.</p>
              <p> 　　The result was, what is called in geometry, the symmetrical 
                image; so that the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted 
                in the mirror and presented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean 
                had beneath his eyes the letter written by Cosette to Marius on 
                the preceding evening.</p>
              <p> 　　It was simple and withering.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　He read the four lines again, but he did not believe them.</p>
              <p> 　　They produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of 
                lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a hallucination, it was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not so.</p>
              <p> 　　Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he 
                looked at Cosette's blotting-book, and the consciousness of the 
                reality returned to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He caught up the blotter and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It comes from there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, 
                the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and 
                he saw no sense in it.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he said to himself: &quot;But this signifies nothing; 
                there is nothing written here.&quot; And he drew a long breath 
                with inexpressible relief.</p>
              <p> 　　Who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants?</p>
              <p> 　　The soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted 
                all illusions.</p>
              <p> 　　He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid 
                delight, almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he 
                had been the dupe.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again 
                he beheld the vision.</p>
              <p> 　　There were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness.</p>
              <p> 　　This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is 
                a reality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the 
                mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　He understood.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into 
                the old arm-chair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy 
                eyes, in utter bewilderment.</p>
              <p> 　　He told himself that it was plain, that the light of the world 
                had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written that to 
                some one.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible once more, 
                give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect of 
                taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!</p>
              <p> 　　Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not 
                yet received Cosette's letter; chance had treacherously carried 
                it <br>
                to Jean Valjean before delivering it to Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Up to that day, Jean Valjean had not been vanquished by trial.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been subjected to fearful proofs; no violence of bad 
                fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed with 
                all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her 
                prey and had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity 
                when it had been necessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability 
                as a reformed man, had yielded up his liberty, risked his head, 
                lost everything, suffered everything, and he had remained disinterested 
                and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to 
                be absent from himself like a martyr. His conscience inured to 
                every assault of destiny, might have appeared to be forever impregnable.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have 
                been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment.</p>
              <p> 　　It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergone 
                in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed 
                him, this was the most terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Never had such pincers seized him hitherto.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt the plucking at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme 
                trial, let us say rather, the only trial, is the loss of the beloved 
                being.</p>
              <p> 　　Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise 
                than as a father; but we have already remarked, above, that into 
                this paternity the widowhood of his life had introduced all the 
                shades of love; he loved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved 
                her as his mother, and he loved her as his sister; and, as he 
                had never had either a woman to love or a wife, as nature is a 
                creditor who accepts no protest, that sentiment also, the most 
                impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest, vague, ignorant, 
                pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious, celestial, angelic, 
                divine; less like a sentiment than like an instinct, less like 
                an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real 
                attraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his immense tenderness 
                for Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed 
                and virgin.</p>
              <p> 　　Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have 
                already indicated.</p>
              <p> 　　No marriage was possible between them; not even that of souls; 
                and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded.</p>
              <p> 　　With the exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception 
                of a childhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long 
                life, known anything of that which may be loved. The passions 
                and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those 
                successive green growths, tender green or dark green, which can 
                be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men 
                who pass fifty.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, and we have insisted on it more than once, all this 
                interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum total was a 
                lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to Cosette. 
                A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother, 
                and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom 
                there was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and 
                adored her, and who held that child as his light, his home, his 
                family, his country, his paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she 
                was escaping from him, that she was slipping from his hands, that 
                she was gliding from him, like a cloud, like water, when he had 
                before his eyes this crushing proof:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;another is the goal of her heart, another is the wish 
                of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but 
                her father, I no longer exist&quot;; when he could no longer doubt, 
                when he said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is going away from me!&quot; the grief which he 
                felt surpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that 
                he had done for the purpose of ending like this! And the very 
                idea of being nothing!</p>
              <p> 　　Then, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through 
                him from head to foot.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the immense reawakening 
                of egotism, and the _I_ in this man's abyss howled.</p>
              <p> 　　There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward 
                subsoil. A despairing certainty does not make its way into a man 
                without thrusting aside and breaking certain profound elements 
                which, in some cases, are the very man himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong flight of 
                all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises.</p>
              <p> 　　Few among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm 
                in duty.</p>
              <p> 　　When the limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable 
                virtue is disconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and 
                convinced himself afresh; he remained bowed and as though petrified 
                and with staring eyes, over those four unobjectionable lines; 
                and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought 
                that everything in this soul was crumbling away.</p>
              <p> 　　He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of 
                revery, with an apparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a 
                fearful thing when a man's calmness reaches the coldness of the 
                statue.</p>
              <p> 　　He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken 
                without his having a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears 
                of the preceding summer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized 
                the precipice, it was still the same; only, Jean Valjean was no 
                longer on the brink, he was at the bottom of it.</p>
              <p> 　　The unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that 
                he had fallen without perceiving it.</p>
              <p> 　　All the light of his life had departed, while he still fancied 
                that he beheld the sun.</p>
              <p> 　　His instinct did not hesitate.</p>
              <p> 　　He put together certain circumstances, certain dates, certain 
                blushes and certain pallors on Cosette's part, and he said to 
                himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is he.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which 
                never misses its aim.</p>
              <p> 　　He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know 
                the name, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, 
                in the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories, 
                the unknown prowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of 
                love adventures, that idler of romance, that idiot, that coward, 
                for it is cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have 
                beside them a father who loves them.</p>
              <p> 　　After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young 
                man was at the bottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded 
                from that quarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the 
                man who had so labored over his soul, the man who had made so 
                many efforts to resolve all life, all misery, and all unhappiness 
                into love, looked into his own breast and there beheld a spectre, 
                Hate.</p>
              <p> 　　Great griefs contain something of dejection.</p>
              <p> 　　They discourage one with existence.</p>
              <p> 　　The man into whom they enter feels something within him withdraw 
                from him.</p>
              <p> 　　In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later on they are 
                sinister.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is hot, 
                when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like 
                the flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains 
                its full thickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still 
                possesses beats which can be returned to it, when one has time 
                for redress, when all women and all smiles and all the future 
                and all the horizon are before one, when the force of life is 
                complete, what is it in old age, when the years hasten on, growing 
                ever paler, to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the 
                stars of the tomb?</p>
              <p> 　　While he was meditating, Toussaint entered.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean rose and asked her:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In what quarter is it?</p>
              <p> 　　Do you know?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Toussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it, sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean began again:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Did you not tell me that just now that there is fighting 
                going on?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! yes, sir,&quot; replied Toussaint.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is in the direction of Saint-Merry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, 
                from the most profound depths of our thought.</p>
              <p> 　　It was, no doubt, under the impulse of a movement of this 
                sort, and of which he was hardly conscious, that Jean Valjean, 
                five minutes later, found himself in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his 
                house. He seemed to be listening.</p>
              <p> 　　Night had come.</p>

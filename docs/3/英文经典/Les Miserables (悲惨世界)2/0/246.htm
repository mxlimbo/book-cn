              <p> 　　SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED </p>
              <p> 　　Cosette's grief, which had been so poignant and lively four 
                or five months previously, had, without her being conscious of 
                the fact, entered upon its convalescence.</p>
              <p> 　　Nature, spring, youth, love for her father, the gayety of 
                the birds and flowers, caused something almost resembling forgetfulness 
                to filter gradually, drop by drop, into that soul, which was so 
                virgin and so young.</p>
              <p> 　　Was the fire wholly extinct there?</p>
              <p> 　　Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed? The truth 
                is, that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer.</p>
              <p> 　　One day she suddenly thought of Marius:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why!&quot; said she, &quot;I no longer think of him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, 
                with a wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young 
                girl, a sword under his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka, 
                passing the gate.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round 
                face, was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of 
                Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a cigar in his mouth.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the 
                regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day, she saw him pass again.</p>
              <p> 　　She took note of the hour.</p>
              <p> 　　From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly 
                every day.</p>
              <p> 　　The officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that &quot;badly 
                kept&quot; garden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very 
                pretty creature, who was almost always there when the handsome 
                lieutenant,--who is not unknown to the reader, and whose name 
                was Theodule Gillenormand,-- passed by.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;See here!&quot; they said to him, &quot;there's a little 
                creature there who is making eyes at you, look.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have I the time,&quot; replied the lancer, &quot;to 
                look at all the girls who look at me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending 
                heavily towards agony, and was saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I could but see her before I die!&quot;-- Had his 
                wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment gazing 
                at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and 
                he would have expired with grief.</p>
              <p> 　　Whose fault was it?</p>
              <p> 　　No one's.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves 
                in sorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who 
                plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, 
                the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which 
                the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the 
                vine which cling, as chance directs, to the capital of a marble 
                column or to the post of a wine-shop: A rapid and decisive moment, 
                critical for every orphan, be she rich or poor, for wealth does 
                not prevent a bad choice; misalliances are made in very high circles, 
                real misalliance is that of souls; and as many an unknown young 
                man, without name, without birth, without fortune, is a marble 
                column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas, 
                so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, who 
                has polished boots and varnished words, if looked at not outside, 
                but inside, a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing 
                more than a block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous 
                passions; the post of a drinking-shop.</p>
              <p> 　　What did Cosette's soul contain?</p>
              <p> 　　Passion calmed or lulled to sleep; something limpid, brilliant, 
                troubled to a certain depth, and gloomy lower down.</p>
              <p> 　　The image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface.</p>
              <p> 　　Did a souvenir linger in the depths?-- Quite at the bottom?--Possibly.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette did not know.</p>
              <p> 　　A singular incident supervened.</p>

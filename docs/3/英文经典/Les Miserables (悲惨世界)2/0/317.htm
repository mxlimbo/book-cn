              <p> 　　HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER</p>
              <p> 　　 At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for 
                the gaze of the drama must be everywhere present,--two children 
                were holding each other by the hand.</p>
              <p> 　　One might have been seven years old, the other five.</p>
              <p> 　　The rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths 
                on the sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were 
                pale and ragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of 
                them said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am very hungry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading 
                his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small 
                stick.</p>
              <p> 　　They were alone in the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　The garden was deserted, the gates had been closed by order 
                of the police, on account of the insurrection. The troops who 
                had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of 
                combat.</p>
              <p> 　　How did those children come there?</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps they had escaped from some guard-house which stood 
                ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at the Barriere d'Enfer; 
                or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the neighboring carrefour, 
                dominated by the pediment on which could be read:</p>
              <p> 　　Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum, some mountebank's booth 
                from which they had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, 
                escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of 
                closing, and had passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes 
                where people read the papers? The fact is, they were stray lambs 
                and they seemed free.</p>
              <p> 　　To be astray and to seem free is to be lost.</p>
              <p> 　　These poor little creatures were, in fact, lost.</p>
              <p> 　　These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been 
                put to some trouble, as the reader will recollect.</p>
              <p> 　　Children of the Thenardiers, leased out to Magnon, attributed 
                to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves fallen from all these rootless 
                branches, and swept over the ground by the wind.</p>
              <p> 　　Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day, and 
                which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had 
                been converted into rags.</p>
              <p> 　　Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as &quot;Abandoned 
                children,&quot; whom the police take note of, collect, mislay 
                and find again on the pavements of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　It required the disturbance of a day like that to account 
                for these miserable little creatures being in that garden.</p>
              <p> 　　If the superintendents had caught sight of them, they would 
                have driven such rags forth. Poor little things do not enter public 
                gardens; still, people should reflect that, as children, they 
                have a right to flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　These children were there, thanks to the locked gates.</p>
              <p> 　　They were there contrary to the regulations.</p>
              <p> 　　They had slipped into the garden and there they remained.</p>
              <p> 　　Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight is supposed 
                to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the inspectors, 
                moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside 
                than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not 
                seen the two delinquents.</p>
              <p> 　　It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. 
                But in June, showers do not count for much.</p>
              <p> 　　An hour after a storm, it can hardly be seen that the beautiful 
                blonde day has wept. The earth, in summer, is as quickly dried 
                as the cheek of a child. At that period of the solstice, the light 
                of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant.</p>
              <p> 　　It takes everything.</p>
              <p> 　　It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself with 
                a sort of suction.</p>
              <p> 　　One would say that the sun was thirsty.</p>
              <p> 　　A shower is but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly 
                drunk up.</p>
              <p> 　　In the morning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything 
                is powdered over.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the 
                rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness.</p>
              <p> 　　The gardens and meadows, having water at their roots, and 
                sun in their flowers, become perfuming-pans of incense, and smoke 
                with all their odors at once.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything smiles, sings and offers itself.</p>
              <p> 　　One feels gently intoxicated.</p>
              <p> 　　The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps man 
                to have patience.</p>
              <p> 　　There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, 
                having the azure of heaven, say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is enough!&quot; dreamers absorbed in the wonderful, 
                dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and evil, 
                contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do 
                not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger 
                of these, and the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor 
                in winter, with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, 
                with the pallet, the attic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering 
                young girls, when they can dream beneath the trees; peaceful and 
                terrible spirits they, and pitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, 
                the infinite suffices them.</p>
              <p> 　　That great need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, 
                they ignore.</p>
              <p> 　　The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they 
                do not think about. The indefinite, which is born from the human 
                and divine combination of the infinite and the finite, escapes 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　Provided that they are face to face with immensity, they smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Joy never, ecstasy forever. Their life lies in surrendering 
                their personality in contemplation. The history of humanity is 
                for them only a detailed plan.</p>
              <p> 　　All is not there; the true All remains without; what is the 
                use of busying oneself over that detail, man?</p>
              <p> 　　Man suffers, that is quite possible; but look at Aldebaran 
                rising!</p>
              <p> 　　The mother has no more milk, the new-born babe is dying.</p>
              <p> 　　I know nothing about that, but just look at this wonderful 
                rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents under 
                the microscope!</p>
              <p> 　　Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if you can!</p>
              <p> 　　These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them 
                to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child.</p>
              <p> 　　God eclipses their souls. This is a family of minds which 
                are, at once, great and petty. Horace was one of them; so was 
                Goethe.</p>
              <p> 　　La Fontaine perhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, 
                tranquil spectators of sorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather 
                be fair, for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile, who would 
                look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an 
                effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor the 
                death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, 
                since there is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds 
                of purple and gold above their heads, declare themselves content, 
                and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars 
                and the songs of the birds are exhausted.</p>
              <p> 　　These are dark radiances.</p>
              <p> 　　They have no suspicion that they are to be pitied.</p>
              <p> 　　Certainly they are so.</p>
              <p> 　　He who does not weep does not see.</p>
              <p> 　　They are to be admired and pitied, as one would both pity 
                and admire a being at once night and day, without eyes beneath 
                his lashes but with a star on his brow.</p>
              <p> 　　The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, 
                a superior philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　That may be; but in this superiority there is some infirmity.</p>
              <p> 　　One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan.</p>
              <p> 　　One may be more than man and less than man. There is incomplete 
                immensity in nature.</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?</p>
              <p> 　　But then, what?</p>
              <p> 　　In whom can we trust?</p>
              <p> 　　Solem quis dicere falsum audeat? Who shall dare to say that 
                the sun is false?</p>
              <p> 　　Thus certain geniuses, themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, 
                man-stars, may be mistaken? That which is on high at the summit, 
                at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light 
                on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all?</p>
              <p> 　　Is not this a desperate state of things? No. But what is there, 
                then, above the sun?</p>
              <p> 　　The god.</p>
              <p> 　　On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning, 
                the Luxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes 
                and flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight.</p>
              <p> 　　The branches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed 
                endeavoring to embrace.</p>
              <p> 　　In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows 
                triumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering 
                little pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate 
                royalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which 
                emanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was 
                perceptible.</p>
              <p> 　　The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall 
                trees.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the 
                tulips, which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made 
                into flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　All around the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these 
                flame-flowers, hummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending 
                rain; this relapse, by which the lilies of the valley and the 
                honeysuckles were destined to profit, had nothing disturbing about 
                it; the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low.</p>
              <p> 　　He who was there aspired to happiness; life smelled good; 
                all nature exhaled candor, help, assistance, paternity, caress, 
                dawn.</p>
              <p> 　　The thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny 
                hand of a baby when one kisses it.</p>
              <p> 　　The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of 
                shadow pierced with light; these goddesses were all tattered with 
                sunlight; rays hung from them on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Around the great fountain, the earth was already dried up 
                to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze to raise 
                little insurrections of dust here and there.</p>
              <p> 　　A few yellow leaves, left over from the autumn, chased each 
                other merrily, and seemed to be playing tricks on each other.</p>
              <p> 　　This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring 
                about it.</p>
              <p> 　　Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath 
                creation, of the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths 
                permeated with love, in this interchange of reverberations and 
                reflections, in this marvellous expenditure of rays, in this infinite 
                outpouring of liquid gold, one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible; 
                and, behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame, one caught 
                a glimpse of God, that millionaire of stars.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to 
                the rain, there was not a grain of ashes.</p>
              <p> 　　The clumps of blossoms had just been bathed; every sort of 
                velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs from the earth 
                in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This magnificence 
                was cleanly.</p>
              <p> 　　The grand silence of happy nature filled the garden.</p>
              <p> 　　A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts 
                of music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings 
                of the breeze.</p>
              <p> 　　All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious 
                whole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper 
                order; the lilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were 
                tardy, some insects in advance of their time; the van-guard of 
                the red June butterflies fraternized with the rear-guard of the 
                white butterflies of May.</p>
              <p> 　　The plantain trees were getting their new skins.</p>
              <p> 　　The breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity 
                of the chestnut-trees. It was splendid. A veteran from the neighboring 
                barracks, who was gazing through the fence, said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here is the Spring presenting arms and in full uniform.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was 
                its hour; the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the 
                great green cloth on earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly.</p>
              <p> 　　God was serving the universal repast.</p>
              <p> 　　Each creature had his pasture or his mess. The ring-dove found 
                his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the goldfinch found 
                chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch found flies, 
                the fly found infusoriae, the bee found flowers. They ate each 
                other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed 
                with good; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.</p>
              <p> 　　The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity 
                of the grand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, 
                they tried to hide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the 
                weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence; and they 
                kept behind the swans' hutch.</p>
              <p> 　　Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, 
                clamor, a sort of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, 
                and dull blows, which were discharges of cannon, struck the ear 
                confusedly. Smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the 
                Halles.</p>
              <p> 　　A bell, which had the air of an appeal, was ringing in the 
                distance.</p>
              <p> 　　These children did not appear to notice these noises.</p>
              <p> 　　The little one repeated from time to time:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am hungry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple 
                approached the great basin.</p>
              <p> 　　They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age, who 
                was leading by the hand a little fellow of six.</p>
              <p> 　　No doubt, a father and his son.</p>
              <p> 　　The little man of six had a big brioche.</p>
              <p> 　　At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the 
                Rues Madame and d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of 
                which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a 
                privilege which was suppressed later on.</p>
              <p> 　　This father and son came from one of these houses, no doubt.</p>
              <p> 　　The two poor little creatures watched &quot;that gentleman&quot; 
                approaching, and hid themselves a little more thoroughly.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one day heard, through 
                his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling his son 
                &quot;to avoid excesses.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had an affable and haughty air, and a mouth which was always 
                smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanical smile, produced 
                by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth rather than 
                the soul.</p>
              <p> 　　The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten into but 
                had not finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was dressed 
                as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the father 
                had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.</p>
              <p> 　　Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were 
                sporting. This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration 
                for the swans. He resembled them in this sense, that he walked 
                like them.</p>
              <p> 　　For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal 
                talent, and they were superb.</p>
              <p> 　　If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had 
                been of an age to understand, they might have gathered the words 
                of this grave man.</p>
              <p> 　　The father was saying to his son:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The sage lives content with little.</p>
              <p> 　　Look at me, my son.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not love pomp.</p>
              <p> 　　I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; 
                I leave that false splendor to badly organized souls.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of 
                the Halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is that?&quot; inquired the child.</p>
              <p> 　　The father replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the Saturnalia.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys 
                behind the green swan-hutch.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is the beginning,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　And, after a pause, he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anarchy is entering this garden.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit 
                it out, and, suddenly burst out crying.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What are you crying about?&quot; demanded his father.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not hungry any more,&quot; said the child.</p>
              <p> 　　The father's smile became more accentuated.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My cake tires me.</p>
              <p> 　　It is stale.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you want any more of it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The father pointed to the swans.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Throw it to those palmipeds.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The child hesitated.</p>
              <p> 　　A person may not want any more of his cake; but that is no 
                reason for giving it away.</p>
              <p> 　　The father went on:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Be humane.</p>
              <p> 　　You must have compassion on animals.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.</p>
              <p> 　　The cake fell very near the edge.</p>
              <p> 　　The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy 
                with some prey.</p>
              <p> 　　They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being 
                wasted, and moved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic 
                agitation, which finally attracted the attention of the swans.</p>
              <p> 　　They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like 
                ships, as they are, and slowly directed their course toward the 
                brioche, with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The swans [cygnes] understand signs [signes],&quot; 
                said the bourgeois, delighted to make a jest.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another 
                sudden increase.</p>
              <p> 　　This time it was sinister.</p>
              <p> 　　There are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than 
                others.</p>
              <p> 　　The one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined 
                drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, and the dismal replies of 
                the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with a black cloud which 
                suddenly veiled the sun.</p>
              <p> 　　The swans had not yet reached the brioche.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us return home,&quot; said the father, &quot;they 
                are attacking the Tuileries.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He grasped his son's hand again.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the 
                distance which separates Royalty from the peerage; that is not 
                far. Shots will soon rain down.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He glanced at the cloud.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; 
                the sky is joining in; the younger branch is condemned.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us return home quickly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should like to see the swans eat the brioche,&quot; 
                said the child.</p>
              <p> 　　The father replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That would be imprudent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he led his little bourgeois away.</p>
              <p> 　　The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward 
                the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the 
                brioche at the same time as the swans.</p>
              <p> 　　It was floating on the water. The smaller of them stared at 
                the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads 
                to the grand flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side 
                of the Rue Madame.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child 
                hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb 
                of the basin, and clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning 
                over the water, on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his 
                right hand with his stick towards the cake.</p>
              <p> 　　The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in so doing, 
                they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service 
                to the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, 
                and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated 
                the brioche towards the child's wand.</p>
              <p> 　　Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake.</p>
              <p> 　　The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened 
                away the swans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　The cake was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty. The elder 
                broke the cake into two portions, a large one and a small one, 
                took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his brother, 
                and said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ram that into your muzzle.&quot;</p>

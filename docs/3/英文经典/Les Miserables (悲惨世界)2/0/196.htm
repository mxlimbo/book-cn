              <p> 　　 Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, 
                the taste of nature, the absence of daily and material activity, 
                the life within himself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent 
                ecstasy towards all creation, had prepared Marius for this possession 
                which is called passion.</p>
              <p> 　　His worship of his father had gradually become a religion, 
                and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his 
                soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Something was required in the foreground.</p>
              <p> 　　Love came.</p>
              <p> 　　A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to 
                the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.--&quot;He 
                is on duty,&quot; said Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius lived in a state of delight.</p>
              <p> 　　It is certain that the young girl did look at him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, he did not pass in front of it any more, in obedience 
                to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common 
                to lovers. He considered it better not to attract &quot;the attention 
                of the father.&quot; He combined his stations behind the trees 
                and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy, so 
                that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and 
                as little as possible by the old gentleman.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, he remained motionless by the half-hour together 
                in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand 
                a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful 
                girl, and she, on her side, turned her charming profile towards 
                him with a vague smile.</p>
              <p> 　　While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in 
                the world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all 
                the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored 
                manoeuvre which Eve understood from the very first day of the 
                world, and which every woman understands from the very first day 
                of her life! her mouth replied to one, and her glance replied 
                to another.</p>
              <p> 　　It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, 
                for often, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. 
                He had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench 
                by the Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with 
                the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. 
                Marius did not understand, and committed this error.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The father&quot; began to grow inexact, and no longer 
                brought &quot;his daughter&quot; every day.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, he came alone.</p>
              <p> 　　Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius paid no heed to these symptoms.</p>
              <p> 　　From the phase of timidity, he had passed, by a natural and 
                fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.</p>
              <p> 　　His love increased.</p>
              <p> 　　He dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpected bliss 
                had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of the shadows 
                over his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　One evening, at dusk, he had found, on the bench which &quot;M. 
                Leblanc and his daughter&quot; had just quitted, a handkerchief, 
                a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white, and 
                fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume.</p>
              <p> 　　He seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with 
                the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,--neither 
                her family name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters 
                were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of, 
                adorable initials, upon which he immediately began to construct 
                his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian name.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ursule!&quot; he thought, &quot;what a delicious name!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on his 
                heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath 
                his lips that he might fall asleep on it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I feel that her whole soul lies within it!&quot; he 
                exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply 
                let it fall from his pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he 
                only displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing 
                the handkerchief and laying it on his heart.</p>
              <p> 　　The beautiful child understood nothing of all this, and signified 
                it to him by imperceptible signs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;O modesty!&quot; said Marius.</p>

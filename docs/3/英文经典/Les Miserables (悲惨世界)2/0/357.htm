              <p> 　　The days that follow weddings are solitary.</p>
              <p> 　　People respect the meditations of the happy pair.</p>
              <p> 　　And also, their tardy slumbers, to some degree.</p>
              <p> 　　The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later 
                on.</p>
              <p> 　　On the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past 
                midday when Basque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, 
                busy in setting his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at 
                the door.</p>
              <p> 　　There had been no ring, which was discreet on such a day. 
                Basque opened the door, and beheld M. Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　He introduced him into the drawing-room, still encumbered 
                and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battle after 
                the joys of the preceding evening.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Dame, sir,&quot; remarked Basque, &quot;we all woke 
                up late.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is your master up?&quot; asked Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is Monsieur's arm?&quot; replied Basque.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Better.</p>
              <p> 　　Is your master up?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which one? the old one or the new one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Pontmercy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Baron,&quot; said Basque, drawing himself 
                up.</p>
              <p> 　　A man is a Baron most of all to his servants.</p>
              <p> 　　He counts for something with them; they are what a philosopher 
                would call, bespattered with the title, and that flatters them.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, be it said in passing, a militant republican as he 
                had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself.</p>
              <p> 　　A small revolution had taken place in the family in connection 
                with this title.</p>
              <p> 　　It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who 
                detached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My son will bear my title.&quot; Marius obeyed.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning to dawn, 
                was delighted to be a Baroness.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Baron?&quot; repeated Basque.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will go and see. I will tell him that M. Fauchelevent 
                is here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some 
                one wishes to speak to him in private, and mention no name.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; ejaculated Basque.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I wish to surprise him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his 
                second &quot;ah!&quot; as an explanation of the first.</p>
              <p> 　　And he left the room.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean remained alone.</p>
              <p> 　　The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. 
                It seemed as though, by lending an air, one might still hear the 
                vague noise of the wedding.</p>
              <p> 　　On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen 
                from garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burned to stumps, 
                added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the corners, 
                three or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle, had 
                the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect 
                was cheerful.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast.</p>
              <p> 　　It has been a happy thing.</p>
              <p> 　　On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers, beneath 
                those extinct lights, people have thought of joy.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun had succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way 
                gayly into the drawing-room.</p>
              <p> 　　Several minutes elapsed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot where Basque had 
                left him.</p>
              <p> 　　He was very pale.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were hollow, and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness 
                that they nearly disappeared in their orbits.</p>
              <p> 　　His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has 
                been up all night.</p>
              <p> 　　The elbows were whitened with the down which the friction 
                of cloth against linen leaves behind it.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished 
                floor at his feet by the sun.</p>
              <p> 　　There came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable 
                light on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. 
                He had not slept either.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is you, father!&quot; he exclaimed, on catching sight 
                of Jean Valjean; &quot;that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious 
                air!</p>
              <p> 　　But you have come too early.</p>
              <p> 　　It is only half past twelve.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette is asleep.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That word:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father,&quot; said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified: 
                supreme felicity.</p>
              <p> 　　There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty wall, 
                a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken 
                or melted.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall 
                was lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent 
                was to him, as to Cosette, a father.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued:</p>
              <p> 　　his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms 
                of joy.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How glad I am to see you!</p>
              <p> 　　If you only knew how we missed you yesterday! Good morning, 
                father.</p>
              <p> 　　How is your hand?</p>
              <p> 　　Better, is it not?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made 
                to himself, he pursued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have both been talking about you.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette loves you so dearly! You must not forget that you 
                have a chamber here, We want nothing more to do with the Rue de 
                l'Homme Arme.</p>
              <p> 　　We will have no more of it at all. How could you go to live 
                in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, 
                which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, 
                and into which one cannot enter?</p>
              <p> 　　You are to come and install yourself here.</p>
              <p> 　　And this very day.</p>
              <p> 　　Or you will have to deal with Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have 
                your own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; 
                the trouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, 
                it is all ready, you have only to take possession of it. Near 
                your bed Cosette has placed a huge, old, easy-chair covered with 
                Utrecht velvet and she has said to it:</p>
              <p> 　　`Stretch out your arms to him.'</p>
              <p> 　　A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your 
                windows, every spring.</p>
              <p> 　　In two months more you will have it. You will have its nest 
                on your left and ours on your right.</p>
              <p> 　　By night it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle.</p>
              <p> 　　Your chamber faces due South.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette will arrange your books for you, your Voyages of Captain 
                Cook and the other,--Vancouver's and all your affairs. I believe 
                that there is a little valise to which you are attached, I have 
                fixed upon a corner of honor for that.</p>
              <p> 　　You have conquered my grandfather, you suit him.</p>
              <p> 　　We will live together.</p>
              <p> 　　Do you play whist? you will overwhelm my grandfather with 
                delight if you play whist.</p>
              <p> 　　It is you who shall take Cosette to walk on the days when 
                I am at the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, as 
                you used to, in the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　We are absolutely resolved to be happy.</p>
              <p> 　　And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you 
                hear, father?</p>
              <p> 　　Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir,&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;I have something 
                to say to you. I am an ex-convict.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, 
                as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear.</p>
              <p> 　　These words: &quot;I am an ex-convict,&quot; proceeding from 
                the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the ear of Marius overshot 
                the possible.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that something had just been said to him; 
                but he did not know what. He stood with his mouth wide open.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was 
                frightful. Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, 
                up to that moment, observed the other man's terrible pallor.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right 
                arm, unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb 
                and showed it to Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is nothing the matter with my hand,&quot; said 
                he.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius looked at the thumb.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There has not been anything the matter with it,&quot; 
                went on Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　There was, in fact, no trace of any injury.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. 
                I absented myself as much as was in my power.</p>
              <p> 　　So I invented this injury in order that I might not commit 
                a forgery, that I might not introduce a flaw into the marriage 
                documents, in order that I might escape from signing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius stammered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The meaning of it is,&quot; replied Jean Valjean, &quot;that 
                I have been in the galleys.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are driving me mad!&quot; exclaimed Marius in terror.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Pontmercy,&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;I 
                was nineteen years in the galleys.</p>
              <p> 　　For theft.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a second offence.</p>
              <p> 　　At the present moment, I have broken my ban.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, 
                resist the evidence, he was forced to give way.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to understand, and, as always happens in such cases, 
                he understood too much. An inward shudder of hideous enlightenment 
                flashed through him; an idea which made him quiver traversed his 
                mind.</p>
              <p> 　　He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the 
                future.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Say all, say all!&quot; he cried.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are Cosette's father!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable 
                horror.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude 
                that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; 
                although our oath to others may not be received in law . . .&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral 
                authority, he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the 
                syllables:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;. . . You will believe me.</p>
              <p> 　　I the father of Cosette! before God, no. Monsieur le Baron 
                Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned my living by 
                pruning trees.</p>
              <p> 　　My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　I am not related to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Reassure yourself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius stammered:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who will prove that to me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I. Since I tell you so.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius looked at the man.</p>
              <p> 　　He was melancholy yet tranquil.</p>
              <p> 　　No lie could proceed from such a calm.</p>
              <p> 　　That which is icy is sincere. The truth could be felt in that 
                chill of the tomb.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, 
                and continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What am I to Cosette?</p>
              <p> 　　A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that she was in 
                existence.</p>
              <p> 　　I love her, it is true.</p>
              <p> 　　One loves a child whom one has seen when very young, being 
                old oneself.</p>
              <p> 　　When one is old, one feels oneself a grandfather towards all 
                little children. You may, it seems to me, suppose that I have 
                something which resembles a heart.</p>
              <p> 　　She was an orphan.</p>
              <p> 　　Without either father or mother. She needed me.</p>
              <p> 　　That is why I began to love her.</p>
              <p> 　　Children are so weak that the first comer, even a man like 
                me, can become their protector.</p>
              <p> 　　I have fulfilled this duty towards Cosette. I do not think 
                that so slight a thing can be called a good action; but if it 
                be a good action, well, say that I have done it. Register this 
                attenuating circumstance.</p>
              <p> 　　To-day, Cosette passes out of my life; our two roads part.</p>
              <p> 　　Henceforth, I can do nothing for her.</p>
              <p> 　　She is Madame Pontmercy.</p>
              <p> 　　Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the change.</p>
              <p> 　　All is well.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not mention 
                them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit.</p>
              <p> 　　How did that deposit come into my hands?</p>
              <p> 　　What does that matter?</p>
              <p> 　　I restore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me.</p>
              <p> 　　I complete the restitution by announcing my true name.</p>
              <p> 　　That concerns me.</p>
              <p> 　　I have a reason for desiring that you should know who I am.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.</p>
              <p> 　　All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. 
                Certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls.</p>
              <p> 　　We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything 
                within us is dispersed; we say the first things that occur to 
                us, which are not always precisely those which should be said. 
                There are sudden revelations which one cannot bear, and which 
                intoxicate like baleful wine.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented 
                itself to him, to the point of addressing that man almost like 
                a person who was angry with him for this avowal.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But why,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;do you tell me all 
                this?</p>
              <p> 　　Who forces you to do so?</p>
              <p> 　　You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither 
                denounced, nor tracked nor pursued.</p>
              <p> 　　You have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation.</p>
              <p> 　　Conclude.</p>
              <p> 　　There is something more.</p>
              <p> 　　In what connection do you make this confession? What is your 
                motive?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My motive?&quot; replied Jean Valjean in a voice so 
                low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself 
                rather than to Marius. &quot;From what motive, in fact, has this 
                convict just said `I am a convict'? Well, yes! the motive is strange.</p>
              <p> 　　It is out of honesty. Stay, the unfortunate point is that 
                I have a thread in my heart, which keeps me fast.</p>
              <p> 　　It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly 
                solid.</p>
              <p> 　　All life falls in ruin around one; one resists.</p>
              <p> 　　Had I been able to tear out that thread, to break it, to undo 
                the knot or to cut it, to go far away, I should have been safe. 
                I had only to go away; there are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; 
                you are happy; I am going.</p>
              <p> 　　I have tried to break that thread, I have jerked at it, it 
                would not break, I tore my heart with it. Then I said:</p>
              <p> 　　`I cannot live anywhere else than here.'</p>
              <p> 　　I must stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not 
                simply remain here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame 
                Pontmercy is sincerely attached to me, she said to the arm-chair: 
                `Stretch out your arms to him,' your grandfather demands nothing 
                better than to have me, I suit him, we shall live together, and 
                take our meals in common, I shall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame 
                Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a habit, we shall have but one roof, 
                one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner in winter, the same 
                promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness, that is everything.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall live as one family. One family!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that word, Jean Valjean became wild.</p>
              <p> 　　He folded his arms, glared at the floor beneath his feet as 
                though he would have excavated an abyss therein, and his voice 
                suddenly rose in thundering tones:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As one family!</p>
              <p> 　　No. I belong to no family.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not belong to yours. I do not belong to any family of 
                men.</p>
              <p> 　　In houses where people are among themselves, I am superfluous.</p>
              <p> 　　There are families, but there is nothing of the sort for me.</p>
              <p> 　　I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside.</p>
              <p> 　　Did I have a father and mother?</p>
              <p> 　　I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave that child in marriage, 
                all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and that she is with 
                a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old man, 
                a household of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that 
                it was well, I said to myself: `Enter thou not.'</p>
              <p> 　　I could have lied, it is true, have deceived you all, and 
                remained Monsieur Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　So long as it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be 
                for myself, and I must not.</p>
              <p> 　　It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, and 
                all would go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very 
                odd thing; my conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however.</p>
              <p> 　　I passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it; you 
                questioned me, and what I have just said to you is so extraordinary 
                that you have the right to do it; well, yes, I have passed the 
                night in alleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself very good 
                reasons, I have done what I could. But there are two things in 
                which I have not succeeded; in breaking the thread that holds 
                me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or in silencing 
                some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. That is why 
                I have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything 
                or nearly everything.</p>
              <p> 　　It is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself; 
                I keep that to myself.</p>
              <p> 　　You know the essential points.</p>
              <p> 　　So I have taken my mystery and have brought it to you.</p>
              <p> 　　And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. It was 
                not a resolution that was easy to take.</p>
              <p> 　　I struggled all night long.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! you think that I did not tell myself that this was no 
                Champmathieu affair, that by concealing my name I was doing no 
                one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given to 
                me by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for a service rendered 
                to him, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should 
                be happy in that chamber which you offer me, that I should not 
                be in any one's way, that I should be in my own little corner, 
                and that, while you would have Cosette, I should have the idea 
                that I was in the same house with her.</p>
              <p> 　　Each one of us would have had his share of happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　If I continued to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange 
                everything.</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, with the exception of my soul. There was joy everywhere 
                upon my surface, but the bottom of my soul remained black.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not enough to be happy, one must be content. Thus I 
                should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have 
                concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, 
                I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full noonday, 
                I should have had shadows, thus, without crying `'ware,' I should 
                have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should 
                have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you 
                knew who I was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed 
                myself to be served by domestics who, had they known, would have 
                said: `How horrible!'</p>
              <p> 　　I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have a 
                right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand!</p>
              <p> 　　There would have existed in your house a division of respect 
                between venerable white locks and tainted white locks; at your 
                most intimate hours, when all hearts thought themselves open to 
                the very bottom to all the rest, when we four were together, your 
                grandfather, you two and myself, a stranger would have been present! 
                I should have been side by side with you in your existence, having 
                for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit. 
                Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself upon you who are 
                living beings.</p>
              <p> 　　I should have condemned her to myself forever. You and Cosette 
                and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap!</p>
              <p> 　　Does it not make you shudder?</p>
              <p> 　　I am only the most crushed of men; I should have been the 
                most monstrous of men. And I should have committed that crime 
                every day!</p>
              <p> 　　And I should have had that face of night upon my visage every 
                day! every day! And I should have communicated to you a share 
                in my taint every day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved, my 
                children, to you, my innocent creatures!</p>
              <p> 　　Is it nothing to hold one's peace? is it a simple matter to 
                keep silence?</p>
              <p> 　　No, it is not simple.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a silence which lies.</p>
              <p> 　　And my lie, and my fraud and my indignity, and my cowardice 
                and my treason and my crime, I should have drained drop by drop, 
                I should have spit it out, then swallowed it again, I should have 
                finished at midnight and have begun again at midday, and my `good 
                morning' would have lied, and my `good night' would have lied, 
                and I should have slept on it, I should have eaten it, with my 
                bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I should 
                have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned 
                soul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why should 
                I do it? in order to be happy.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to be happy. Have I the right to be happy?</p>
              <p> 　　I stand outside of life, Sir.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean paused.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius listened.</p>
              <p> 　　Such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean lowered his voice once more, but it was no longer 
                a dull voice--it was a sinister voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You ask why I speak?</p>
              <p> 　　I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked, you say.</p>
              <p> 　　Yes!</p>
              <p> 　　I am denounced! yes!</p>
              <p> 　　I am tracked!</p>
              <p> 　　By whom? By myself.</p>
              <p> 　　It is I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, 
                and I push myself, and I arrest myself, and I execute myself, 
                and when one holds oneself, one is firmly held.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the 
                neck and extending it towards Marius:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you see that fist?&quot; he continued.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you think that <br>
                it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! 
                conscience is another grasp!</p>
              <p> 　　If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never understand 
                duty; for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it is implacable.</p>
              <p> 　　One would say that it punished you for comprehending it; but 
                no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where you feel 
                God beside you.</p>
              <p> 　　One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at 
                peace with himself.&quot;</p>

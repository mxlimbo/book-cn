              <p> 　　THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES</p>
              <p> 　　Night was fully come, nothing made its appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　All that they heard was confused noises, and at intervals, 
                fusillades; but these were rare, badly sustained and distant.</p>
              <p> 　　This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a sign that the 
                Government was taking its time, and collecting its forces.</p>
              <p> 　　These fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on 
                strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events.</p>
              <p> 　　He went in search of Gavroche, who had set to making cartridges 
                in the tap-room, by the dubious light of two candles placed on 
                the counter by way of precaution, on account of the powder which 
                was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no gleam outside.</p>
              <p> 　　The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have any 
                light in the upper stories.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely 
                with his cartridges.</p>
              <p> 　　The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the tap-room 
                and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted.</p>
              <p> 　　A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held 
                it between his legs.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment, distracted by a 
                hundred &quot;amusing&quot; things, had not even seen this man.</p>
              <p> 　　When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his 
                eyes, admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, 
                the street urchin sprang to his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment, would 
                have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and 
                in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but, from 
                the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a 
                sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that 
                was going on.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to 
                step around him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person 
                whom one is afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish 
                countenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so 
                giddy and so profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all 
                those grimaces of an old man which signify: Ah bah! impossible!</p>
              <p> 　　My sight is bad!</p>
              <p> 　　I am dreaming! can this be? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! 
                etc.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched both fists in his 
                pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic 
                pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, 
                incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the mien of the chief 
                of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering a Venus among the 
                blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizing a Raphael 
                in a heap of daubs.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole being was at work, the instinct which scents out, 
                and the intelligence which combines.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that a great event had happened in Gavroche's 
                life.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that 
                Enjolras accosted him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are small,&quot; said Enjolras, &quot;you will not 
                be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Go out of the barricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish 
                about a bit in the streets, and come back and tell me what is 
                going on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche raised himself on his haunches.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So the little chaps are good for something! that's very 
                lucky! I'll go!</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust 
                the big ones.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, 
                as he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: &quot;Do you 
                see that big fellow there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's a police spy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you sure of it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice 
                of the Port Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words 
                in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced 
                to be at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　The man left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied 
                by three others.</p>
              <p> 　　The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, went and 
                placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention, 
                behind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was 
                leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves 
                upon him.</p>
              <p> 　　Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At this abrupt query, the man started.</p>
              <p> 　　He plunged his gaze deep into Enjolras' clear eyes and appeared 
                to grasp the latter's meaning. He smiled with a smile than which 
                nothing more disdainful, more energetic, and more resolute could 
                be seen in the world, and replied with haughty gravity:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I see what it is.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, yes!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are a police spy?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am an agent of the authorities.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And your name?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Javert.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras made a sign to the four men.</p>
              <p> 　　In the twinkling of an eye, before Javert had time to turn 
                round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned and searched.</p>
              <p> 　　They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces 
                of glass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, 
                and with this motto:</p>
              <p> 　　Supervision and vigilance, and on the other this note: &quot;JAVERT, 
                inspector of police, aged fifty-two,&quot; and the signature of 
                the Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained 
                several gold pieces.</p>
              <p> 　　They left him his purse and his watch.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the watch, at the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized 
                a paper in an envelope, which Enjolras unfolded, and on which 
                he read these five lines, written in the very hand of the Prefect 
                of Police:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector 
                Javert will make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true 
                that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank 
                of the Seine, near the Jena bridge.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his 
                arms behind his back, and fastened him to that celebrated post 
                in the middle of the room which had formerly given the wine-shop 
                its name.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and 
                had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped 
                up to Javert and said to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's the mouse who has caught the cat.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when 
                those about the wine-shop noticed it.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert had not uttered a single cry.</p>
              <p> 　　At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, 
                Joly, Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades 
                came running up.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with 
                ropes that he could not make a movement, raised his head with 
                the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a police spy,&quot; said Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　And turning to Javert:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is 
                taken.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert replied in his most imperious tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not at once?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are saving our powder.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then finish the business with a blow from a knife.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Spy,&quot; said the handsome Enjolras, &quot;we are 
                judges and not assassins.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he called Gavroche:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here you! go about your business!</p>
              <p> 　　Do what I told you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I'm going!&quot; cried Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　And halting as he was on the point of setting out:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way, you will give me his gun!&quot; and he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I leave you the musician, but I want the clarionet.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through 
                the opening in the large barricade.</p>

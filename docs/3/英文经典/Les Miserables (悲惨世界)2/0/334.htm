              <p> 　　THE &quot;SPUN&quot; MAN</p>
              <p> 　　 This justice must be rendered to the police of that period, 
                that even in the most serious public junctures, it imperturbably 
                fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers and surveillance. 
                A revolt was, in its eyes, no pretext for allowing malefactors 
                to take the bit in their own mouths, and for neglecting society 
                for the reason that the government was in peril.</p>
              <p> 　　The ordinary service was performed correctly in company with 
                the extraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of an incalculable political event already begun, 
                under the pressure of a possible revolution, a police agent, &quot;spun&quot; 
                a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection 
                and barricades.</p>
              <p> 　　It was something precisely parallel which took place on the 
                afternoon of the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the 
                slope of the right shore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no longer any bank there now.</p>
              <p> 　　The aspect of the locality has changed.</p>
              <p> 　　On that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed 
                to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other.</p>
              <p> 　　The one who was in advance was trying to get away, the one 
                in the rear was trying to overtake the other.</p>
              <p> 　　It was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in 
                silence. Neither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, 
                as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner 
                redouble his pace.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that it was an appetite following its 
                prey, and purposely without wearing the air of doing so.</p>
              <p> 　　The prey was crafty and on its guard.</p>
              <p> 　　The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting 
                dog were observed.</p>
              <p> 　　The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien 
                and not an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seize 
                him was rude of aspect, and must have been rude to encounter.</p>
              <p> 　　The first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided 
                the second; but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; 
                any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his 
                eyes the sombre hostility of flight, and all the menace that fear 
                contains.</p>
              <p> 　　The shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even 
                a boatman nor a lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored 
                here and there.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay 
                opposite, and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, 
                the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling, 
                tattered, and equivocal being, who was uneasy and trembling beneath 
                a ragged blouse, and the other like a classic and official personage, 
                wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin.</p>
              <p> 　　Perchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he 
                were to see them closer at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　What was the object of the second man?</p>
              <p> 　　Probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.</p>
              <p> 　　When a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it 
                is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, the whole question lies in the color.</p>
              <p> 　　To be dressed in blue is glorious; to be dressed in red is 
                disagreeable.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a purple from below.</p>
              <p> 　　It is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this 
                sort which the first man is desirous of shirking.</p>
              <p> 　　If the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him 
                as yet, it was, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing 
                him lead up to some significant meeting-place and to some group 
                worth catching. This delicate operation is called &quot;spinning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the 
                buttoned-up man, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach 
                on the quay as it was passing along empty, made a sign to the 
                driver; the driver understood, evidently recognized the person 
                with whom he had to deal, turned about and began to follow the 
                two men at the top of the quay, at a foot-pace. This was not observed 
                by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance.</p>
              <p> 　　The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Elysees. 
                The bust of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along 
                above the parapet.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to 
                their agents contains this article:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Always have on hand a hackney-coach, in case of emergency.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While these two men were manoeuvring, each on his own side, 
                with irreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane 
                on the quay which descended to the shore, and which permitted 
                cab-drivers arriving from Passy to come to the river and water 
                their horses. This inclined plane was suppressed later on, for 
                the sake of symmetry; horses may die of thirst, but the eye is 
                gratified.</p>
              <p> 　　It is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to 
                ascend this inclined plane, with a view to making his escape into 
                the Champs-Elysees, a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, 
                much infested with policemen, and where the other could easily 
                exercise violence.</p>
              <p> 　　This point on the quay is not very far distant from the house 
                brought to Paris from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated 
                as &quot;the house of Francois I.&quot; A guard house is situated 
                close at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　To the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being 
                tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to advance along the quay on the shore.</p>
              <p> 　　His position was visibly becoming critical.</p>
              <p> 　　What was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into 
                the Seine?</p>
              <p> 　　Henceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; 
                there was no other inclined plane, no staircase; and they were 
                near the spot, marked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont 
                de Jena, where the bank, growing constantly narrower, ended in 
                a slender tongue, and was lost in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　There he would inevitably find himself blocked between the 
                perpendicular wall on his right, the river on his left and in 
                front of him, and the authorities on his heels.</p>
              <p> 　　It is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from 
                sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height, produced 
                by some demolition or other.</p>
              <p> 　　But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind 
                that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt? The expedient 
                would have been puerile.</p>
              <p> 　　He certainly was not dreaming of such a thing.</p>
              <p> 　　The innocence of thieves does not extend to that point.</p>
              <p> 　　The pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's 
                edge, which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of 
                the quay.</p>
              <p> 　　The man who was being followed arrived at this little mound 
                and went round it, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.</p>
              <p> 　　The latter, as he did not see, could not be seen; he took 
                advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk 
                very rapidly. In a few moments, he had reached the rubbish heap 
                and passed round it. There he halted in sheer amazement.</p>
              <p> 　　The man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　Total eclipse of the man in the blouse.</p>
              <p> 　　The shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about 
                thirty paces long, then it plunged into the water which beat against 
                the wall of the quay.</p>
              <p> 　　The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine 
                without being seen by the man who was following him. What had 
                become of him?</p>
              <p> 　　The man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of 
                the shore, and remained there in thought for a moment, his fists 
                clenched, his eyes searching.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once he smote his brow.</p>
              <p> 　　He had just perceived, at the point where the land came to 
                an end and the water began, a large iron grating, low, arched, 
                garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges.</p>
              <p> 　　This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay, 
                opened on the river as well as on the shore.</p>
              <p> 　　A blackish stream passed under it. This stream discharged 
                into the Seine.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted 
                corridor could be descried.</p>
              <p> 　　The man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an 
                air of reproach.</p>
              <p> 　　As this gaze did not suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; 
                he shook it, it resisted solidly.</p>
              <p> 　　It is probable that it had just been opened, although no sound 
                had been heard, a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating; 
                but it is certain that it had been closed again. This indicated 
                that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook 
                but a key.</p>
              <p> 　　This evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who 
                was trying to move the grating, and evoked from him this indignant 
                ejaculation:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is too much!</p>
              <p> 　　A government key!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a 
                whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables 
                accented almost ironically:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come!</p>
              <p> 　　Come!</p>
              <p> 　　Come!</p>
              <p> 　　Come!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That said, and in the hope of something or other, either that 
                he should see the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself 
                on the watch behind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of 
                a pointer.</p>
              <p> 　　The hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, 
                had, in its turn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. 
                The coachman, foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' 
                muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom, and which 
                is so familiar to Parisians, to whom, be it said in parenthesis, 
                the Government sometimes applies it.</p>
              <p> 　　The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jena turned their heads, 
                before they pursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these 
                two motionless items in the landscape, the man on the shore, the 
                carriage on the quay.</p>

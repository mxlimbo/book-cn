              <p> 　　THE LARK'S MEADOW </p>
              <p> 　　Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush 
                upon whose track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted 
                the building, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, 
                than Marius also glided out of the house.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer 
                the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone 
                to live in the Rue de la Verrerie &quot;for political reasons&quot;; 
                this quarter was one where, at that epoch, insurrection liked 
                to install itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius said to Courfeyrac: &quot;I have come to sleep with 
                you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed, which was furnished 
                with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned 
                to the hovel, paid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, 
                had his books, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs 
                loaded on a hand-cart and went off without leaving his address, 
                so that when Javert returned in the course of the morning, for 
                the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding 
                evening, he found only Ma'am Bougon, who answered: &quot;Moved 
                away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ma'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent 
                an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before. 
                &quot;Who would ever have said it?&quot; she exclaimed to the 
                portresses of the quarter, &quot;a young man like that, who had 
                the air of a girl!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. 
                The first was, that he now had a horror of that house, where he 
                had beheld, so close at hand, and in its most repulsive and most 
                ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even 
                more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The 
                second was, that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which 
                would insue in all probability, and be brought in to testify against 
                Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, 
                was afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home 
                at the time of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, 
                but without success.</p>
              <p> 　　A month passed, then another.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had learned from a young 
                licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, that 
                Thenardier was in close confinement.</p>
              <p> 　　Every Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's 
                office of La Force for Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs 
                from Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed 
                money.</p>
              <p> 　　These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac 
                who lent and to Thenardier who received them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To whom can they go?&quot; thought Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whence can this come to me?&quot; Thenardier asked himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged 
                through a trap-door once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again buried 
                in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld 
                very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he 
                loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown 
                beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; 
                and, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of 
                grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a 
                spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most 
                terrible of collisions.</p>
              <p> 　　No conjecture was possible.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew.</p>
              <p> 　　It certainly was not Ursule.</p>
              <p> 　　And the Lark was a nickname.</p>
              <p> 　　And what was he to think of the old man?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he actually in hiding from the police? The white-haired 
                workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides 
                recurred to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc 
                were one and the same person.</p>
              <p> 　　So he disguised himself?</p>
              <p> 　　That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he 
                not called for help?</p>
              <p> 　　Why had he fled?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he, in short, the man whom Thenardier thought that he 
                recognized?</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier might have been mistaken.</p>
              <p> 　　These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, 
                detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of 
                the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, 
                and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and 
                he could not stir. All had vanished, save love.</p>
              <p> 　　Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations.</p>
              <p> 　　Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, 
                and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even 
                heard these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What if I were to go to such a place? What if I were 
                to try such and such a thing?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule was evidently 
                somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole life was now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty 
                within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still aspired 
                to this, but he no longer expected it.</p>
              <p> 　　To crown all, his poverty had returned.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that icy breath close to him, on his heels.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had 
                discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued 
                work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy to get 
                rid of, and difficult to take up again.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet 
                doses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which 
                are sometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh 
                vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, 
                fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the 
                angles of the ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker 
                who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery!</p>
              <p> 　　He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells 
                himself that, after all, it is the same thing.</p>
              <p> 　　Error!</p>
              <p> 　　Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. 
                To replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a 
                food.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. 
                Passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating 
                him into chimaeras without object or bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　One no longer emerges from one's self except for the purpose 
                of going off to dream. Idle production.</p>
              <p> 　　Tumultuous and stagnant gulf.</p>
              <p> 　　And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.</p>
              <p> 　　This is a law.</p>
              <p> 　　Man, in a state of revery, is generally prodigal and slack; 
                the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.</p>
              <p> 　　There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for 
                if enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But 
                the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, 
                is lost.</p>
              <p> 　　Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.</p>
              <p> 　　Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest 
                as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which 
                ends in one of two holds, suicide or crime.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one 
                goes out to throw one's self in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Excess of revery breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with 
                his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw.</p>
              <p> 　　What we have just written seems strange, and yet it is true.</p>
              <p> 　　The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the 
                heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy 
                and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon; the star of 
                the inner night.</p>
              <p> 　　She--that was Marius' whole thought.</p>
              <p> 　　He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious 
                that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat, and that his 
                new coat was growing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that 
                his hat was wearing out, that his boots were giving out, and he 
                said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I could but see her once again before I die!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, 
                that her glance had told him so, that she did not know his name, 
                but that she did know his soul, and that, wherever she was, however 
                mysterious the place, she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether 
                she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her?</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced 
                by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons for anything 
                but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to 
                himself: &quot;It is her thoughts that are coming to me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he added: &quot;Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, 
                was sufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled 
                hope, into his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, especially at that evening hour which is 
                the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, 
                the most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled 
                his brain, to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else.</p>
              <p> 　　He called this &quot;writing to her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite 
                the contrary.</p>
              <p> 　　He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards 
                any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness 
                and rectitude than ever.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, 
                what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and 
                men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort 
                of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness.</p>
              <p> 　　His judgment, which was almost wholly disassociated from hope, 
                held itself aloof and soared on high.</p>
              <p> 　　In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived 
                him, and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life, 
                of humanity, and of destiny.</p>
              <p> 　　Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has 
                given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not 
                viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this 
                double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.</p>
              <p> 　　The soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.</p>
              <p> 　　However, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. 
                It merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained 
                to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. 
                He thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the 
                bottomless abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!&quot; he repeated to himself, &quot;shall I not 
                see her again before then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier 
                on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, 
                you reach the Rue de la Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little 
                while before arriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you 
                come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and 
                monotonous chain of the boulevards of Paris, where Ruysdeel would 
                be tempted to sit down.</p>
              <p> 　　There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, 
                a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which 
                flutter rags drying in the wind, and an old market-gardener's 
                house, built in the time of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly 
                pierced with dormer windows, dilapidated palisades, a little water 
                amid poplar-trees, women, voices, laughter; on the horizon the 
                Pantheon, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grace, black, 
                squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, and in the background, 
                the severe square crests of the towers of Notre Dame.</p>
              <p> 　　As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither.</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.</p>
              <p> 　　It chanced that Marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot 
                of ground, near the water.</p>
              <p> 　　That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, a passer-by. 
                Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the 
                place, asked this passer-by:--&quot;What is the name of this spot?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The person replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the Lark's meadow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But after the word &quot;Lark&quot; Marius heard nothing more.</p>
              <p> 　　These sudden congealments in the state of revery, which a 
                single word suffices to evoke, do occur.</p>
              <p> 　　The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea, and 
                it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.</p>
              <p> 　　The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in 
                the depths of Marius' melancholy.--&quot;Stop,&quot; said he with 
                a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides, 
                &quot;this is her meadow. I shall know where she lives now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was absurd, but irresistible.</p>
              <p> 　　And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.</p>
            　　THE LARK'S MEADOW 
              <p> 　　Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush 
                upon whose track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted 
                the building, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, 
                than Marius also glided out of the house.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer 
                the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone 
                to live in the Rue de la Verrerie &quot;for political reasons&quot;; 
                this quarter was one where, at that epoch, insurrection liked 
                to install itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius said to Courfeyrac: &quot;I have come to sleep with 
                you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed, which was furnished 
                with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned 
                to the hovel, paid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, 
                had his books, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs 
                loaded on a hand-cart and went off without leaving his address, 
                so that when Javert returned in the course of the morning, for 
                the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding 
                evening, he found only Ma'am Bougon, who answered: &quot;Moved 
                away!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Ma'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent 
                an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before. 
                &quot;Who would ever have said it?&quot; she exclaimed to the 
                portresses of the quarter, &quot;a young man like that, who had 
                the air of a girl!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. 
                The first was, that he now had a horror of that house, where he 
                had beheld, so close at hand, and in its most repulsive and most 
                ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even 
                more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The 
                second was, that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which 
                would insue in all probability, and be brought in to testify against 
                Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, 
                was afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home 
                at the time of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, 
                but without success.</p>
              <p> 　　A month passed, then another.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had learned from a young 
                licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, that 
                Thenardier was in close confinement.</p>
              <p> 　　Every Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's 
                office of La Force for Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs 
                from Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed 
                money.</p>
              <p> 　　These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac 
                who lent and to Thenardier who received them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To whom can they go?&quot; thought Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whence can this come to me?&quot; Thenardier asked himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged 
                through a trap-door once more.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again buried 
                in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld 
                very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he 
                loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown 
                beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; 
                and, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of 
                grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a 
                spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most 
                terrible of collisions.</p>
              <p> 　　No conjecture was possible.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew.</p>
              <p> 　　It certainly was not Ursule.</p>
              <p> 　　And the Lark was a nickname.</p>
              <p> 　　And what was he to think of the old man?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he actually in hiding from the police? The white-haired 
                workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides 
                recurred to his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc 
                were one and the same person.</p>
              <p> 　　So he disguised himself?</p>
              <p> 　　That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he 
                not called for help?</p>
              <p> 　　Why had he fled?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he, in short, the man whom Thenardier thought that he 
                recognized?</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier might have been mistaken.</p>
              <p> 　　These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, 
                detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of 
                the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, 
                and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and 
                he could not stir. All had vanished, save love.</p>
              <p> 　　Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations.</p>
              <p> 　　Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, 
                and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even 
                heard these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What if I were to go to such a place? What if I were 
                to try such and such a thing?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule was evidently 
                somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　His whole life was now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty 
                within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still aspired 
                to this, but he no longer expected it.</p>
              <p> 　　To crown all, his poverty had returned.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that icy breath close to him, on his heels.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had 
                discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued 
                work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy to get 
                rid of, and difficult to take up again.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet 
                doses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which 
                are sometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh 
                vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, 
                fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the 
                angles of the ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker 
                who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery!</p>
              <p> 　　He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells 
                himself that, after all, it is the same thing.</p>
              <p> 　　Error!</p>
              <p> 　　Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. 
                To replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a 
                food.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. 
                Passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating 
                him into chimaeras without object or bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　One no longer emerges from one's self except for the purpose 
                of going off to dream. Idle production.</p>
              <p> 　　Tumultuous and stagnant gulf.</p>
              <p> 　　And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.</p>
              <p> 　　This is a law.</p>
              <p> 　　Man, in a state of revery, is generally prodigal and slack; 
                the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.</p>
              <p> 　　There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for 
                if enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But 
                the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, 
                is lost.</p>
              <p> 　　Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.</p>
              <p> 　　Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest 
                as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which 
                ends in one of two holds, suicide or crime.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one 
                goes out to throw one's self in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Excess of revery breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with 
                his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw.</p>
              <p> 　　What we have just written seems strange, and yet it is true.</p>
              <p> 　　The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the 
                heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy 
                and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon; the star of 
                the inner night.</p>
              <p> 　　She--that was Marius' whole thought.</p>
              <p> 　　He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious 
                that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat, and that his 
                new coat was growing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that 
                his hat was wearing out, that his boots were giving out, and he 
                said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If I could but see her once again before I die!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, 
                that her glance had told him so, that she did not know his name, 
                but that she did know his soul, and that, wherever she was, however 
                mysterious the place, she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether 
                she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her?</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced 
                by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons for anything 
                but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to 
                himself: &quot;It is her thoughts that are coming to me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he added: &quot;Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, 
                was sufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled 
                hope, into his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, especially at that evening hour which is 
                the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, 
                the most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled 
                his brain, to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else.</p>
              <p> 　　He called this &quot;writing to her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite 
                the contrary.</p>
              <p> 　　He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards 
                any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness 
                and rectitude than ever.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, 
                what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and 
                men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort 
                of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness.</p>
              <p> 　　His judgment, which was almost wholly disassociated from hope, 
                held itself aloof and soared on high.</p>
              <p> 　　In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived 
                him, and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life, 
                of humanity, and of destiny.</p>
              <p> 　　Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has 
                given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not 
                viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this 
                double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.</p>
              <p> 　　The soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.</p>
              <p> 　　However, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. 
                It merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained 
                to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. 
                He thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the 
                bottomless abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!&quot; he repeated to himself, &quot;shall I not 
                see her again before then!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier 
                on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, 
                you reach the Rue de la Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little 
                while before arriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you 
                come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and 
                monotonous chain of the boulevards of Paris, where Ruysdeel would 
                be tempted to sit down.</p>
              <p> 　　There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, 
                a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which 
                flutter rags drying in the wind, and an old market-gardener's 
                house, built in the time of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly 
                pierced with dormer windows, dilapidated palisades, a little water 
                amid poplar-trees, women, voices, laughter; on the horizon the 
                Pantheon, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grace, black, 
                squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, and in the background, 
                the severe square crests of the towers of Notre Dame.</p>
              <p> 　　As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither.</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.</p>
              <p> 　　It chanced that Marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot 
                of ground, near the water.</p>
              <p> 　　That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, a passer-by. 
                Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the 
                place, asked this passer-by:--&quot;What is the name of this spot?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The person replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is the Lark's meadow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But after the word &quot;Lark&quot; Marius heard nothing more.</p>
              <p> 　　These sudden congealments in the state of revery, which a 
                single word suffices to evoke, do occur.</p>
              <p> 　　The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea, and 
                it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.</p>
              <p> 　　The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in 
                the depths of Marius' melancholy.--&quot;Stop,&quot; said he with 
                a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides, 
                &quot;this is her meadow. I shall know where she lives now.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was absurd, but irresistible.</p>
              <p> 　　And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.</p>

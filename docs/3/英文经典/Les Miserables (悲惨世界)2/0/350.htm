              <p> 　　THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION, 
                TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY</p>
              <p> 　　 Everything was made ready for the wedding.</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor, on being consulted, declared that it might take 
                place in February. It was then December.</p>
              <p> 　　A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.</p>
              <p> 　　The grandfather was not the least happy of them all.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The wonderful, beautiful girl!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And she has so sweet and good an air! she is, without 
                exception, the most charming girl that I have ever seen in my 
                life.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, she'll have virtues with an odor of violets.</p>
              <p> 　　How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such 
                a creature.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don't go to 
                pettifogging, I beg of you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre 
                to paradise. The transition had not been softened, and they would 
                have been stunned, had they not been dazzled by it.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you understand anything about it?&quot; said Marius 
                to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Cosette, &quot;but it seems to me 
                that the good God is caring for us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, 
                arranged everything, made everything easy.</p>
              <p> 　　He hastened towards Cosette's happiness with as much ardor, 
                and, apparently with as much joy, as Cosette herself.</p>
              <p> 　　As he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate 
                problem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette's 
                civil status.</p>
              <p> 　　If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it might prevent 
                the marriage, who knows?</p>
              <p> 　　He extricated Cosette from all difficulties.</p>
              <p> 　　He concocted for her a family of dead people, a sure means 
                of not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion 
                of an extinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the 
                daughter of the other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent 
                had been gardeners to the convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry 
                was made at that convent; the very best information and the most 
                respectable references abounded; the good nuns, not very apt and 
                but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity, and not 
                attaching any importance to the matter, had never understood exactly 
                of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the daughter. They 
                said what was wanted and they said it with zeal.</p>
              <p> 　　An acte de notoriete was drawn up.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette became in the eyes of the law, Mademoiselle Euphrasie 
                Fauchelevent.</p>
              <p> 　　She was declared an orphan, both father and mother being dead.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean so arranged it that he was appointed, under the 
                name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's guardian, with M. Gillenormand 
                as supervising guardian over him.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted 
                a legacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to 
                remain unknown.</p>
              <p> 　　The original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety-four 
                thousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expended on 
                the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs 
                of that amount having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited 
                in the hands of a third party, was to be turned over to Cosette 
                at her majority, or at the date of her marriage. This, taken as 
                a whole, was very acceptable, as the reader will perceive, especially 
                when the sum due was half a million.</p>
              <p> 　　There were some peculiarities here and there, it is true, 
                but they were not noticed; one of the interested parties had his 
                eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousand 
                francs.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old 
                man whom she had so long called father.</p>
              <p> 　　He was merely a kinsman; another Fauchelevent was her real 
                father.</p>
              <p> 　　At any other time this would have broken her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　But at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through, 
                it cast but a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full 
                of joy that the cloud did not last long. She had Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The young man arrived, the old man was effaced; such is life.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to 
                seeing enigmas around her; every being who has had a mysterious 
                childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean:</p>
              <p> 　　Father.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father 
                Gillenormand. It is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant 
                compliments and presents.</p>
              <p> 　　While Jean Valjean was building up for Cosette a normal situation 
                in society and an unassailable status, M. Gillenormand was superintending 
                the basket of wedding gifts.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing so amused him as being magnificent.</p>
              <p> 　　He had given to Cosette a robe of Binche guipure which had 
                descended to him from his own grandmother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;These fashions come up again,&quot; said he, &quot;ancient 
                things are the rage, and the young women of my old age dress like 
                the old women of my childhood.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel 
                lacquer, with swelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.--&quot;Let 
                us hear the confession of these dowagers,&quot; he said, &quot;let 
                us see what they have in their paunches.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all his wives, 
                of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins, damasks, 
                lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros de Tours, India kerchiefs 
                embroidered in gold that could be washed, dauphines without a 
                right or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alencon point lace, 
                parures in antique goldsmith's work, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented 
                with microscopic battles, gewgaws and ribbons-- he lavished everything 
                on Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild 
                with gratitude towards M. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness 
                without limit clothed in satin and velvet. Her wedding basket 
                seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim. Her soul flew out into 
                the azure depths, with wings of Mechlin lace.</p>
              <p> 　　The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have 
                already said, by the ecstasy of the grandfather.</p>
              <p> 　　A sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.</p>
              <p> 　　Every morning, a fresh offering of bric-a-brac from the grandfather 
                to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　All possible knickknacks glittered around her.</p>
              <p> 　　One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst 
                of his bliss, said, apropos of I know not what incident:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The men of the revolution are so great, that they have 
                the prestige of the ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each 
                one of them seems to me an antique memory.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Moire antique!&quot; exclaimed the old gentleman.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Thanks, Marius. That is precisely the idea of which 
                I was in search.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose 
                colored moire antique was added to Cosette's wedding presents.</p>
              <p> 　　From these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of 
                wisdom.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Love is all very well; but there must be something else 
                to go with it.</p>
              <p> 　　The useless must be mingled with happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　Happiness is only the necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　Season that enormously with the superfluous for me.</p>
              <p> 　　A palace and her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand waterworks 
                of Versailles.</p>
              <p> 　　Give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess.</p>
              <p> 　　Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundred 
                thousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far 
                as you can see, beneath a marble colonnade.</p>
              <p> 　　I consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of 
                marble and gold.</p>
              <p> 　　Dry happiness resembles dry bread. One eats, but one does 
                not dine.</p>
              <p> 　　I want the superfluous, the useless, the extravagant, excess, 
                that which serves no purpose. I remember to have seen, in the 
                Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall as a three-story house 
                which marked the hours, which had the kindness to indicate the 
                hour, but which had not the air of being made for that; and which, 
                after having struck midday, or midnight,-- midday, the hour of 
                the sun, or midnight, the hour of love,-- or any other hour that 
                you like, gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, 
                birds and fishes, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a host of things which 
                emerged from a niche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor 
                Charles the Fifth, and Eponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little 
                gilded goodmen, who played on the trumpet to boot.</p>
              <p> 　　Without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through 
                the air, on every occasion, without any one's knowing why. Is 
                a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that? 
                For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, 
                and I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, 
                and all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell 
                through his dithyrambs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are ignorant of the art of festivals.</p>
              <p> 　　You do not know how to organize a day of enjoyment in this 
                age,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Your nineteenth century is weak.</p>
              <p> 　　It lacks excess.</p>
              <p> 　　It ignores the rich, it ignores the noble.</p>
              <p> 　　In everything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid, 
                colorless, odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your bourgeois 
                who set up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, 
                violet, ebony and calico. Make way!</p>
              <p> 　　Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying Mademoiselle Clutch-penny. 
                Sumptuousness and splendor.</p>
              <p> 　　A louis d'or has been stuck to a candle.</p>
              <p> 　　There's the epoch for you.</p>
              <p> 　　My demand is that I may flee from it beyond the Sarmatians.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! in 1787, I predict that all was lost, from the day when 
                I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Leon, Duc de Chabot, Duc 
                de Montbazon, Marquis de Sonbise, Vicomte de Thouars, peer of 
                France, go to Longchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits.</p>
              <p> 　　In this century, men attend to business, they gamble on 'Change, 
                they win money, they are stingy.</p>
              <p> 　　People take care of their surfaces and varnish them; every 
                one is dressed as though just out of a band-box, washed, soaped, 
                scraped, shaved, combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned 
                on the outside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, 
                neat, and at the same time, death of my life, in the depths of 
                their consciences they have dung-heaps and cesspools that are 
                enough to make a cow-herd who blows his nose in his fingers, recoil.</p>
              <p> 　　I grant to this age the device: `Dirty Cleanliness.'</p>
              <p> 　　Don't be vexed, Marius, give me permission to speak; I say 
                no evil of the people as you see, I am always harping on your 
                people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to 
                the bourgeoisie.</p>
              <p> 　　I belong to it.</p>
              <p> 　　He who loves well lashes well.</p>
              <p> 　　Thereupon, I say plainly, that now-a-days people marry, but 
                that they no longer know how to marry.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the ancient manners.</p>
              <p> 　　I regret everything about them, their elegance, their chivalry, 
                those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous luxury which every 
                one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphony above 
                stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyous 
                faces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, the 
                songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, the devil's own row, 
                the huge knots of ribbon.</p>
              <p> 　　I regret the bride's garter.</p>
              <p> 　　The bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of Venus. On what 
                does the war of Troy turn?</p>
              <p> 　　On Helen's garter, parbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed 
                the divine break over the head of Meriones that great brazen helmet 
                of ten points? why did Achilles and Hector hew each other up with 
                vast blows of their lances? Because Helen allowed Paris to take 
                her garter.</p>
              <p> 　　With Cosette's garter, Homer would construct the Iliad.</p>
              <p> 　　He would put in his poem, a loquacious old fellow, like me, 
                and he would call him Nestor. My friends, in bygone days, in those 
                amiable days of yore, people married wisely; they had a good contract, 
                and then they had a good carouse.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Cujas had taken his departure, Gamacho entered.</p>
              <p> 　　But, in sooth! the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands 
                its due, and which wants to have its wedding also. People supped 
                well, and had at table a beautiful neighbor without a guimpe so 
                that her throat was only moderately concealed. Oh! the large laughing 
                mouths, and how gay we were in those days! youth was a bouquet; 
                every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft of 
                roses; whether he was a shepherd or a warrior; and if, by chance, 
                one was a captain of dragoons, one found means to call oneself 
                Florian.</p>
              <p> 　　People thought much of looking well. They embroidered and 
                tinted themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the air 
                of a precious stone.</p>
              <p> 　　People had no straps to their boots, they had no boots.</p>
              <p> 　　They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty, 
                coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords 
                by their sides.</p>
              <p> 　　The humming-bird has beak and claws.</p>
              <p> 　　That was the day of the Galland Indies.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the sides of that century was delicate, the other was 
                magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　To-day, people are serious.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude; your 
                century is unfortunate.</p>
              <p> 　　People would drive away the Graces as being too low in the 
                neck.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas! beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness.</p>
              <p> 　　Since the revolution, everything, including the ballet-dancers, 
                has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave; your 
                rigadoons are doctrinarian.</p>
              <p> 　　It is necessary to be majestic. People would be greatly annoyed 
                if they did not carry their chins in their cravats.</p>
              <p> 　　The ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries, is to resemble 
                M. Royer-Collard. And do you know what one arrives at with that 
                majesty? at being petty.</p>
              <p> 　　Learn this: joy is not only joyous; it is great.</p>
              <p> 　　But be in love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you 
                marry, with fever and giddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of 
                happiness!</p>
              <p> 　　Be grave in church, well and good.</p>
              <p> 　　But, as soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must make 
                a dream whirl around the bride.</p>
              <p> 　　A marriage should be royal and chimerical; it should promenade 
                its ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup.</p>
              <p> 　　I have a horror of a paltry wedding.</p>
              <p> 　　Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one day, at least.</p>
              <p> 　　Be one of the gods.</p>
              <p> 　　Ah! people might be sylphs. Games and Laughter, argiraspides; 
                they are stupids.</p>
              <p> 　　My friends, every recently made bridegroom ought to be Prince 
                Aldobrandini. Profit by that unique minute in life to soar away 
                to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles, even if you do 
                have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prune them of their 
                splendors; don't scrimp on the day when you beam.</p>
              <p> 　　The wedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry 
                out my fancy, it would be gallant, violins would be heard under 
                the trees.</p>
              <p> 　　Here is my programme:</p>
              <p> 　　sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival the 
                rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids.</p>
              <p> 　　The nuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well 
                dressed locks and entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains 
                to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine monsters. &quot;Triton 
                trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque Des sons si ravissants 
                qu'il ravissait quiconque!&quot;[65]</p>
              <p> 　　--there's a festive programme, there's a good one, or else 
                I know nothing of such matters, deuce take it!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 [65] &quot;Triton trotted on before, and drew from his conch-shell 
                sounds so ravishing that he delighted everyone!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 While the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening 
                to himself, Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed 
                freely at each other.</p>
              <p> 　　Aunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable 
                placidity. Within the last five or six months she had experienced 
                a certain amount of emotions.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, Marius brought 
                back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Marius reconciled, 
                Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius wedding a 
                millionairess.</p>
              <p> 　　The six hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, her indifference of a girl taking her first communion 
                returned to her.</p>
              <p> 　　She went regularly to service, told her beads, read her euchology, 
                mumbled Aves in one corner of the house, while I love you was 
                being whispered in the other, and she beheld Marius and Cosette 
                in a vague way, like two shadows. The shadow was herself.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the 
                soul, neutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated 
                as the business of living, receives no impressions, either human, 
                or pleasant or painful, with the exception of earthquakes and 
                catastrophes. This devotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his 
                daughter, corresponds to a cold in the head.</p>
              <p> 　　You smell nothing of life. Neither any bad, nor any good odor.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the 
                elderly spinster's indecision.</p>
              <p> 　　Her father had acquired the habit of taking her so little 
                into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter of consent 
                to Marius' marriage.</p>
              <p> 　　He had acted impetuously, according to his wont, having, a 
                despot-turned slave, but a single thought,--to satisfy Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the aunt,--it had not even occurred to him that the 
                aunt existed, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and, 
                sheep as she was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her 
                inmost soul, but impassible externally, she had said to herself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My father has settled the question of the marriage without 
                reference to me; I shall settle the question of the inheritance 
                without consulting him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She was rich, in fact, and her father was not.</p>
              <p> 　　She had reserved her decision on this point. It is probable 
                that, had the match been a poor one, she would have left him poor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a beggar, 
                let him be a beggar himself!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　But Cosette's half-million pleased the aunt, and altered her 
                inward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned.</p>
              <p> 　　One owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs, 
                and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave 
                her fortune to these young people, since they did not need it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather-- 
                M. Gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the 
                finest in the house.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That will make me young again,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
                an old plan of mine.</p>
              <p> 　　I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in 
                my chamber.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. 
                He had the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, 
                which he had by him in the piece, and which he believed to have 
                emanated from Utrecht with a buttercup-colored satin ground, covered 
                with velvet auricula blossoms.--&quot;It was with that stuff,&quot; 
                said he, &quot;that the bed of the Duchesse d'Anville at la Roche-Guyon 
                was draped.&quot;-- On the chimney-piece, he set a little figure 
                in Saxe porcelain, carrying a muff against her nude stomach.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study, which 
                Marius needed; a study, it will be remembered, being required 
                by the council of the order.</p>

              <p> 　　 The visit took place.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle against pestilence 
                and suffocation.</p>
              <p> 　　It was, at the same time, a voyage of discovery.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligent workingman, 
                who was very young at the time, related curious details with regard 
                to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself obliged 
                to omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of 
                official style.</p>
              <p> 　　The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch, extremely 
                rudimentary.</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that 
                subterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refused 
                to go any further.</p>
              <p> 　　The operation was complicated; the visit entailed the necessity 
                of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same 
                time, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the 
                gratings and the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to 
                indicate the currents at the point where they parted, to define 
                the respective bounds of the divers basins, to sound the small 
                sewers grafted on the principal sewer, to measure the height under 
                the key-stone of each drain, and the width, at the spring of the 
                vaults as well as at the bottom, in order to determine the arrangements 
                with regard to the level of each water-entrance, either of the 
                bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　They advanced with toil.</p>
              <p> 　　The lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, a fainting sewerman was carried out.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain points, there were precipices. The soil had given 
                away, the pavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a 
                bottomless well; they found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; 
                they had great difficulty in getting him out again.</p>
              <p> 　　On the advice of Fourcroy, they lighted large cages filled 
                with tow steeped in resin, from time to time, in spots which had 
                been sufficiently disinfected.</p>
              <p> 　　In some places, the wall was covered with misshapen fungi,--one 
                would have said tumors; the very stone seemed diseased within 
                this unbreathable atmosphere.</p>
              <p> 　　Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill.</p>
              <p> 　　At the point of separation of the two water-conduits of the 
                Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date 
                of 1550; this stone indicated the limits where Philibert Delorme, 
                charged by Henri II. with visiting the subterranean drains of 
                Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century 
                on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth 
                century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue Vielle-du-Temple, 
                vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of the eighteenth 
                in the western section of the collecting canal, walled and vaulted 
                in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that of 
                1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt 
                sewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh 
                water of Menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand 
                Sewer of Paris, an advancement analogous to that of a peasant 
                who should become first valet de chambre to the King; something 
                like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.</p>
              <p> 　　Here and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they 
                thought they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated 
                in the very sewer itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Hideous in-pace. An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of 
                these cells.</p>
              <p> 　　They walled them all up.</p>
              <p> 　　Some of their finds were singular; among others, the skeleton 
                of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from the Jardin des Plantes 
                in 1800, a disappearance probably connected with the famous and 
                indisputable apparition of the devil in the Rue des Bernardins, 
                in the last year of the eighteenth century.</p>
              <p> 　　The poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, 
                a perfectly preserved rag-picker's basket excited the admiration 
                of all connoisseurs.</p>
              <p> 　　Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle with 
                intrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold and 
                silver, precious stones, coins.</p>
              <p> 　　If a giant had filtered this cesspool, he would have had the 
                riches of centuries in his lair. At the point where the two branches 
                of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye separate, they 
                picked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing on one 
                side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat, and on the other, a 
                wolf with a tiara on his head.</p>
              <p> 　　The most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the 
                Grand Sewer. This entrance had formerly been closed by a grating 
                of which nothing but the hinges remained.</p>
              <p> 　　From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which, 
                arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated there in 
                the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart.</p>
              <p> 　　Bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was of very fine batiste, and in one of the corners, less 
                frayed than the rest, they made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered 
                above these seven letters:</p>
              <p> 　　LAVBESP.</p>
              <p> 　　The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the seven letters 
                signified Laubespine. They recognized the fact, that what they 
                had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat.</p>
              <p> 　　Marat in his youth had had amorous intrigues.</p>
              <p> 　　This was when he was a member of the household of the Comte 
                d'Artois, in the capacity of physician to the Stables. From these 
                love affairs, historically proved, with a great lady, he had retained 
                this sheet.</p>
              <p> 　　As a waif or a souvenir.</p>
              <p> 　　At his death, as this was the only linen of any fineness which 
                he had in his house, they buried him in it.</p>
              <p> 　　Some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling-band 
                in which the tragic Friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness.</p>
              <p> 　　Bruneseau passed on.</p>
              <p> 　　They left that rag where it hung; they did not put the finishing 
                touch to it. Did this arise from scorn or from respect?</p>
              <p> 　　Marat deserved both. And then, destiny was there sufficiently 
                stamped to make them hesitate to touch it.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot 
                which they select.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, the relic was a strange one.</p>
              <p> 　　A Marquise had slept in it; Marat had rotted in it; it had 
                traversed the Pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer. This 
                chamber rag, of which Watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched 
                every fold, had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed gaze of 
                Dante.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris 
                lasted seven years, from 1805 to 1812.</p>
              <p> 　　As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew, directed, and completed considerable 
                works; in 1808 he lowered the arch of the Ponceau, and, everywhere 
                creating new lines, he pushed the sewer, in 1809, under the Rue 
                Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of the Innocents; in 1810, 
                under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the Salpetriere; in 1811 
                under the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Peres, under the Rue du Mail, under 
                the Rue de l'Echarpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812, under the 
                Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussee d'Antin. At the same time, 
                he had the whole net-work disinfected and rendered healthful.</p>
              <p> 　　In the second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance 
                of his son-in-law Nargaud.</p>
              <p> 　　It was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient 
                society cleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of 
                its sewer. There was that much clean, at all events.</p>
              <p> 　　Tortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected 
                by gullies, jolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending 
                illogically, fetid, wild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with 
                cicatrices on its pavements and scars on its walls, terrible,--such 
                was, retrospectively viewed, the antique sewer of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Ramifications in every direction, crossings, of trenches, 
                branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, coecum, blind 
                alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby 
                sweats, on the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness; 
                nothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive 
                apparatus of Babylon, a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, 
                a titanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous 
                blind mole, the past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth 
                which has been splendor.</p>
              <p> 　　This, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.</p>

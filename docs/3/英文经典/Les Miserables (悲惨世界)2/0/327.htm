              <p> 　　ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER</p>
              <p> 　　 Let the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the 
                subterranean net-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will 
                outline on the banks a species of large branch grafted on the 
                river.</p>
              <p> 　　On the right bank, the belt sewer will form the trunk of this 
                branch, the secondary ducts will form the branches, and those 
                without exit the twigs.</p>
              <p> 　　This figure is but a summary one and half exact, the right 
                angle, which is the customary angle of this species of subterranean 
                ramifications, being very rare in vegetation.</p>
              <p> 　　A more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can 
                be formed by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental 
                alphabet, as intricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, 
                and the misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent 
                confusion, and as at haphazard, now by their angles, again by 
                their extremities.</p>
              <p> 　　Sinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in 
                the Lower Empire and in the Orient of old.</p>
              <p> 　　The masses regarded these beds of decomposition, these monstrous 
                cradles of death, with a fear that was almost religious.</p>
              <p> 　　The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive to giddiness 
                than the lions' ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according 
                to the rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh.</p>
              <p> 　　It was from the sewer of Munster that John of Leyden produced 
                his false moon, and it was from the cess-pool of Kekscheb that 
                oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the veiled prophet of Khorassan, 
                caused his false sun to emerge.</p>
              <p> 　　The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. 
                The Germoniae[58] narrated Rome.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and formidable thing.</p>
              <p> 　　It has been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum.</p>
              <p> 　　Crime, intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, 
                thought, theft, all that human laws persecute or have persecuted, 
                is hidden in that hole; the maillotins in the fourteenth century, 
                the tire-laine of the fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, 
                Morin's illuminated in the seventeenth, the chauffeurs [brigands] 
                in the eighteenth.</p>
              <p> 　　A hundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged 
                thence, the pickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had 
                its cave, Paris had its sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic picareria, 
                accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and 
                at evening, it returned thither, fierce and sly, through the Maubuee 
                outlet, as into a bed-chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　 [58] Steps on the Aventine Hill, leading to the Tiber, to 
                which the bodies of executed criminals were dragged by hooks to 
                be thrown into the Tiber.</p>
              <p> 　　 It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley 
                Vide-Gousset, [Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], 
                for the scene of their daily labor, should have for their domicile 
                by night the culvert of the Chemin-Vert, or the catch basin of 
                Hurepoix. Hence a throng of souvenirs.</p>
              <p> 　　All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitary corridors; 
                everywhere is putrescence and miasma; here and there are breathing-holes, 
                where Villon within converses with Rabelais without.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions 
                and of all attempts.</p>
              <p> 　　Political economy therein spies a detritus, social philosophy 
                there beholds a residuum.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer is the conscience of the city.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything there converges and confronts everything else.</p>
              <p> 　　In that livid spot there are shades, but there are no longer 
                any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at least, its 
                definitive form. The mass of filth has this in its favor, that 
                it is not a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there.</p>
              <p> 　　The mask of Basil is to be found there, but one beholds its 
                cardboard and its strings and the inside as well as the outside, 
                and it is accentuated by honest mud. Scapin's false nose is its 
                next-door neighbor.</p>
              <p> 　　All the uncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, 
                fall into this trench of truth, where the immense social sliding 
                ends.</p>
              <p> 　　They are there engulfed, but they display themselves there.</p>
              <p> 　　This mixture is a confession. There, no more false appearances, 
                no plastering over is possible, filth removes its shirt, absolute 
                denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages, there is 
                nothing more except what really exists, presenting the sinister 
                form of that which is coming to an end. There, the bottom of a 
                bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handle tells a tale of 
                domesticity; there the core of an apple which has entertained 
                literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; the effigy 
                on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas' 
                spittle meets Falstaff's puking, the louis-d'or which comes from 
                the gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope's end 
                of the suicide.</p>
              <p> 　　a livid foetus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles which 
                danced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronounced 
                judgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was 
                formerly Margoton's petticoat; it is more than fraternization, 
                it is equivalent to addressing each other as thou.</p>
              <p> 　　All which was formerly rouged, is washed free.</p>
              <p> 　　The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic.</p>
              <p> 　　It tells everything.</p>
              <p> 　　The sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul.</p>
              <p> 　　When one has passed one's time in enduring upon earth the 
                spectacle of the great airs which reasons of state, the oath, 
                political sagacity, human justice, professional probity, the austerities 
                of situation, incorruptible robes all assume, it solaces one to 
                enter a sewer and to behold the mire which befits it.</p>
              <p> 　　This is instructive at the same time.</p>
              <p> 　　We have just said that history passes through the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　The Saint-Barthelemys filter through there, drop by drop, 
                between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations, political 
                and religious butcheries, traverse this underground passage of 
                civilization, and thrust their corpses there.</p>
              <p> 　　For the eye of the thinker, all historic murderers are to 
                be found there, in that hideous penumbra, on their knees, with 
                a scrap of their winding-sheet for an apron, dismally sponging 
                out their work. Louis XI.</p>
              <p> 　　is there with Tristan, Francois I. with Duprat, Charles IX. 
                is there with his mother, Richelieu is there with Louis XIII., 
                Louvois is there, Letellier is there, Hebert and Maillard are 
                there, scratching the stones, and trying to make the traces of 
                their actions disappear.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath these vaults one hears the brooms of spectres. One 
                there breathes the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes. 
                One beholds reddish reflections in the corners.</p>
              <p> 　　There flows a terrible stream, in which bloody hands have 
                been washed.</p>
              <p> 　　The social observer should enter these shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　They form a part of his laboratory.</p>
              <p> 　　Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everything desires 
                to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation is useless.</p>
              <p> 　　What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the shameful 
                side.</p>
              <p> 　　Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and does 
                not permit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration 
                of things which disappear, in the watching of things which vanish, 
                it recognizes all.</p>
              <p> 　　It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman from 
                the scrap of her dress. From the cess-pool, it re-constitutes 
                the city; from mud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd 
                it infers the amphora or the jug.</p>
              <p> 　　By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, it 
                recognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse 
                from the Jewry of the Ghetto.</p>
              <p> 　　It re-discovers in what remains that which has been, good, 
                evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace, the ink-blot of 
                the cavern, the drop of sweat from the brothel, trials undergone, 
                temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, the turn which characters 
                have taken as they became abased, the trace of prostitution in 
                souls of which their grossness rendered them capable, and on the 
                vesture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina's elbowing.</p>

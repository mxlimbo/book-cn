              <p> 　　LUX FACTA EST</p>
              <p> 　　 During the second year, precisely at the point in this history 
                which the reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of 
                the Luxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite 
                aware why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did 
                not set foot in the alley.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a 
                serene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is 
                when the weather is fine.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of 
                the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky 
                of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.</p>
              <p> 　　He went straight to &quot;his alley,&quot; and when he reached 
                the end of it he perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known 
                couple. Only, when he approached, it certainly was the same man; 
                but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl.</p>
              <p> 　　The person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature, 
                possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise 
                moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous 
                graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be 
                expressed only by these two words,-- &quot;fifteen years.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, 
                a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of 
                rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, 
                whence smiles darted like sunbeams, and words like music, a head 
                such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set upon a neck that 
                Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus.</p>
              <p> 　　And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching 
                face, her nose was not handsome-- it was pretty; neither straight 
                nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, 
                that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,--which drives 
                painters to despair, and charms poets.</p>
              <p> 　　When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which 
                were constantly lowered.</p>
              <p> 　　He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated with shadow 
                and modesty.</p>
              <p> 　　This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she 
                listened to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and 
                nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined 
                with those drooping eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter 
                of the same man, a sister of the former, no doubt.</p>
              <p> 　　But when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him, for 
                the second time, near the bench, and he had examined her attentively, 
                he recognized her as the same. In six months the little girl had 
                become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more frequent 
                than this phenomenon.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling 
                of an eye, and become roses all at once.</p>
              <p> 　　One left them children but yesterday; today, one finds them 
                disquieting to the feelings.</p>
              <p> 　　This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As 
                three days in April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, 
                six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty.</p>
              <p> 　　Her April had arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake 
                up, pass suddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures 
                of all sorts, and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all 
                of a sudden.</p>
              <p> 　　That is the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell 
                due yesterday.</p>
              <p> 　　The young girl had received her quarterly income.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt 
                hat, her merino gown, her scholar's shoes, and red hands; taste 
                had come to her with beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad 
                with a sort of rich and simple elegance, and without affectation. 
                She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same material, 
                and a bonnet of white crape.</p>
              <p> 　　Her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which 
                toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and 
                her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot. When one passed 
                near her, her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating 
                perfume.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the man, he was the same as usual.</p>
              <p> 　　The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl 
                raised her eyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but 
                in that veiled azure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance 
                of a child. She looked at Marius indifferently, as she would have 
                stared at the brat running beneath the sycamores, or the marble 
                vase which cast a shadow on the bench, and Marius, on his side, 
                continued his promenade, and thought about something else.</p>
              <p> 　　He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or 
                six times, but without even turning his eyes in her direction.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the 
                Luxembourg; as usual, he found there &quot;the father and daughter;&quot; 
                but he paid no further attention to them.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful 
                than he had when she was homely. He passed very near the bench 
                where she sat, because such was his habit.</p>

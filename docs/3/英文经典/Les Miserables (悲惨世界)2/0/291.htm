              <p> 　　THE EXTREME EDGE</p>
              <p> 　　 Marius had reached the Halles.</p>
              <p> 　　There everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless 
                than in the neighboring streets.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre 
                had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background 
                the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
                on the Saint-Eustache side.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the 
                Corinthe barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius directed his steps towards that red light.</p>
              <p> 　　It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees, and he caught 
                a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Precheurs. He entered 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding the other end, 
                did not see him.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that he was very close to that which he had come in 
                search of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached 
                the elbow of that short section of the Rue Mondetour which was, 
                as the reader will remember, the only communication which Enjolras 
                had preserved with the outside world. At the corner of the last 
                house, on his left, he thrust his head forward, and looked into 
                the fragment of the Rue Mondetour.</p>
              <p> 　　A little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
                which cast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself 
                engulfed, he perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the 
                wine-shop, and beyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless 
                wall, and men crouching down with guns on their knees.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was ten fathoms distant from him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the interior of the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed 
                the rest of the wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had but a step more to take.</p>
              <p> 　　Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded 
                his arms, and fell to thinking about his father.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been 
                so proud a soldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under 
                the Republic, and had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, 
                who had beheld Genoa, Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, 
                Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who had left on all the victorious battle-fields 
                of Europe drops of that same blood, which he, Marius, had in his 
                veins, who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command, 
                who had lived with his sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling 
                on his breast, his cockade blackened with powder, his brow furrowed 
                with his helmet, in barracks, in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, 
                and who, at the expiration of twenty years, had returned from 
                the great wars with a scarred cheek, a smiling countenance, tranquil, 
                admirable, pure as a child, having done everything for France 
                and nothing against her.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his 
                hour had struck, that following his father, he too was about to 
                show himself brave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, 
                to offer his breast to bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the 
                enemy, to seek death, that he was about to wage war in his turn 
                and descend to the field of battle, and that the field of battle 
                upon which he was to descend was the street, and that the war 
                in which he was about to engage was civil war!</p>
              <p> 　　He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and 
                into this he was about to fall.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought of his father's sword, which his grandfather had 
                sold to a second-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. 
                He said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done 
                well to escape from him, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; 
                that if it had thus fled, it was because it was intelligent and 
                because it had foreseen the future; that it had had a presentiment 
                of this rebellion, the war of the gutters, the war of the pavements, 
                fusillades through cellar-windows, blows given and received in 
                the rear; it was because, coming from Marengo and Friedland, it 
                did not wish to go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie; it was because, 
                after what it had done with the father, it did not wish to do 
                this for the son! He told himself that if that sword were there, 
                if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow, he had 
                dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness 
                between Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched 
                his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword 
                of the angel! He told himself that it was fortunate that it was 
                not there and that it had disappeared, that that was well, that 
                that was just, that his grandfather had been the true guardian 
                of his father's glory, and that it was far better that the colonel's 
                sword should be sold at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, 
                thrown among the old junk, than that it should, to-day, wound 
                the side of his country.</p>
              <p> 　　And then he fell to weeping bitterly.</p>
              <p> 　　This was horrible.</p>
              <p> 　　But what was he to do?</p>
              <p> 　　Live without Cosette he could not.</p>
              <p> 　　Since she was gone, he must needs die.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he not given her his word of honor that he would die?</p>
              <p> 　　She had gone knowing that; this meant that it pleased her 
                that Marius should die.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, it was clear that she no longer loved him, since 
                she had departed thus without warning, without a word, without 
                a letter, although she knew his address!</p>
              <p> 　　What was the good of living, and why should he live now? And 
                then, what! should he retreat after going so far? should he flee 
                from danger after having approached it? should he slip away after 
                having come and peeped into the barricade? slip away, all in a 
                tremble, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;After all, I have had enough of it as it is. I have 
                seen it, that suffices, this is civil war, and I shall take my 
                leave!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him? Who 
                were in need of him possibly! who were a mere handful against 
                an army!</p>
              <p> 　　Should he be untrue at once to his love, to country, to his 
                word?</p>
              <p> 　　Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism? 
                But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his father was 
                there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him 
                on the loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;March on, you poltroon!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, 
                he dropped his head.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once he raised it.</p>
              <p> 　　A sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in 
                his mind.</p>
              <p> 　　There is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar 
                to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to be near 
                death.</p>
              <p> 　　The vision of the action into which he felt that he was, perhaps, 
                on the point of entering, appeared to him no more as lamentable, 
                but as superb.</p>
              <p> 　　The war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable 
                inward working of his soul, before the eye of his thought. All 
                the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him 
                in throngs, but without troubling him.</p>
              <p> 　　He left none of them unanswered.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us see, why should his father be indignant?</p>
              <p> 　　Are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity 
                of duty? What was there that was degrading for the son of Colonel 
                Pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin?</p>
              <p> 　　It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is something 
                quite different.</p>
              <p> 　　The question is no longer one of sacred territory,--but of 
                a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds.</p>
              <p> 　　But is it true that the country does wail?</p>
              <p> 　　France bleeds, but liberty smiles; and in the presence of 
                liberty's smile, France forgets her wound. And then if we look 
                at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak 
                of civil war?</p>
              <p> 　　Civil war--what does that mean?</p>
              <p> 　　Is there a foreign war? Is not all war between men war between 
                brothers?</p>
              <p> 　　War is qualified only by its object.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only 
                just and unjust war.</p>
              <p> 　　Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded, 
                war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is 
                hastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may 
                be necessary.</p>
              <p> 　　What have we to reproach that war with?</p>
              <p> 　　War does not become a disgrace, the sword does not become 
                a disgrace, except when it is used for assassinating the right, 
                progress, reason, civilization, truth.</p>
              <p> 　　Then war, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called 
                crime. Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right 
                does one form of man despise another?</p>
              <p> 　　By what right should the sword of Washington disown the pike 
                of Camille Desmoulins?</p>
              <p> 　　Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, 
                which is the greater? the one is the defender, the other the liberator.</p>
              <p> 　　Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city's limits 
                without taking the object into a consideration?</p>
              <p> 　　Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von Blankenheim, 
                Coligny, Hedgerow war?</p>
              <p> 　　War of the streets? Why not?</p>
              <p> 　　That was the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of 
                Pelagius.</p>
              <p> 　　But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, 
                Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against 
                the foreigner.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; 
                the right divine is a stranger.</p>
              <p> 　　Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates 
                the geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out 
                the English, in both cases, regaining possession of one's own 
                territory.</p>
              <p> 　　There comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; 
                after philosophy, action is required; live force finishes what 
                the idea has sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton 
                ends; the encyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　After AEschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton.</p>
              <p> 　　Multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. Their mass 
                bears witness to apathy.</p>
              <p> 　　A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience.</p>
              <p> 　　Men must be stirred up, pushed on, treated roughly by the 
                very benefit of their deliverance, their eyes must be wounded 
                by the true, light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls. 
                They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being; 
                this dazzling awakens them.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars. Great combatants 
                must rise, must enlighten nations with audacity, and shake up 
                that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine, 
                Caesarian glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, and absolute 
                majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation, in their 
                twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs of the night. Down 
                with the tyrant!</p>
              <p> 　　Of whom are you speaking?</p>
              <p> 　　Do you call Louis Philippe the tyrant?</p>
              <p> 　　No; no more than Louis XVI. Both of them are what history 
                is in the habit of calling good kings; but principles are not 
                to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, the 
                peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no concessions, 
                then; all encroachments on man should be repressed. There is a 
                divine right in Louis XVI., there is because a Bourbon in Louis 
                Philippe; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation 
                of right, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection, 
                they must be combated; it must be done, France being always the 
                one to begin. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, what cause is more just, and consequently, what 
                war is greater, than that which re-establishes social truth, restores 
                her throne to liberty, restores the people to the people, restores 
                sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of France, 
                restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every 
                germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates 
                the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal 
                concord, and places the human race once more on a level with the 
                right?</p>
              <p> 　　These wars build up peace. An enormous fortress of prejudices, 
                privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences, 
                iniquities, and darkness still stands erect in this world, with 
                its towers of hatred. It must be cast down.</p>
              <p> 　　This monstrous mass must be made to crumble. To conquer at 
                Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no one who has not noticed it in his own case--the 
                soul,-- and therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with 
                ubiquity, has a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in 
                the most violent extremities, and it often happens that heartbroken 
                passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest 
                monologues, treat subjects and discuss theses.</p>
              <p> 　　Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the thread of the syllogism 
                floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm of thought.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the situation of Marius' mind.</p>
              <p> 　　As he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in 
                every direction, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about 
                to do, his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The 
                insurgents were here conversing in a low voice, without moving, 
                and there was perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last 
                stage of expectation.</p>
              <p> 　　Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius descried 
                a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc.</p>
              <p> 　　Below, by the lights of the torch, which was thrust between 
                the paving-stones, this head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing 
                could be stranger, in that sombre and uncertain gleam, than that 
                livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristling hair, its 
                eyes fixed and staring, and its yawning mouth, bent over the street 
                in an attitude of curiosity.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that the man who was dead was surveying 
                those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed 
                from that head, descended in reddish threads from the window to 
                the height of the first floor, where it stopped.</p>

              <p> 　　 Marius kept his promise.</p>
              <p> 　　He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where the icy perspiration 
                stood in beads.</p>
              <p> 　　This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive 
                farewell to an unhappy soul.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which 
                Eponine had given him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight.</p>
              <p> 　　He was impatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted 
                that the unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when Marius 
                began to think of unfolding this paper.</p>
              <p> 　　He laid her gently on the ground, and went away.</p>
              <p> 　　Something told him that he could not peruse that letter in 
                the presence of that body.</p>
              <p> 　　He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, 
                folded and sealed with a woman's elegant care.</p>
              <p> 　　The address was in a woman's hand and ran:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac's, 
                Rue de la Verrerie, No. 16.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He broke the seal and read:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out 
                immediately. We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, 
                No. 7. In a week we shall be in England.</p>
              <p> 　　COSETTE.</p>
              <p> 　　June 4th.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even 
                acquainted with Cosette's handwriting.</p>
              <p> 　　What had taken place may be related in a few words.</p>
              <p> 　　Eponine had been the cause of everything.</p>
              <p> 　　After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a double 
                idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on 
                the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came 
                across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while 
                Eponine disguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed 
                to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Leave your house.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to 
                Cosette:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme 
                Arme with Toussaint. Next week, we shall be in London.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had 
                hastily penned a couple of lines to Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　But how was she to get the letter to the post? She never went 
                out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission, would 
                certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma, 
                Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine in man's 
                clothes, who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette 
                had called to &quot;this young workman&quot; and had handed him 
                five francs and the letter, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Carry this letter immediately to its address.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Eponine had put the letter in her pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to Courfeyrac's 
                quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of delivering 
                the letter, but,--a thing which every jealous and loving soul 
                will comprehend,--&quot;to see.&quot; There she had waited for 
                Marius, or at least for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of seeing.</p>
              <p> 　　When Courfeyrac had told her: &quot;We are going to the barricades,&quot; 
                an idea flashed through her mind, to fling herself into that death, 
                as she would have done into any other, and to thrust Marius into 
                it also.</p>
              <p> 　　She had followed Courfeyrac, had made sure of the locality 
                where the barricade was in process of construction; and, quite 
                certain, since Marius had received no warning, and since she had 
                intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to his trysting 
                place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the Rue Plumet, 
                had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of his 
                friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the 
                barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　She reckoned on Marius' despair when he should fail to find 
                Cosette; she was not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de 
                la Chanvrerie herself.</p>
              <p> 　　What she did there the reader has just seen.</p>
              <p> 　　She died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the 
                beloved being into their own death, and who say: &quot;No one 
                shall have him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses.</p>
              <p> 　　So she loved him! For one moment the idea occurred to him 
                that he ought not to die now. Then he said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is going away.</p>
              <p> 　　Her father is taking her to England, and my grandfather refuses 
                his consent to the marriage. Nothing is changed in our fates.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Dreamers like Marius are subject to supreme attacks of dejection, 
                and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigue of living is 
                insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then he reflected that 
                he had still two duties to fulfil:</p>
              <p> 　　to inform Cosette of his death and send her a final farewell, 
                and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation, 
                that poor child, Eponine's brother and Thenardier's son.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained 
                the note-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love 
                for Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Our marriage was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　I asked my grandfather, he refused; I have no fortune, neither 
                hast thou.</p>
              <p> 　　I hastened to thee, thou wert no longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it.</p>
              <p> 　　I die.</p>
              <p> 　　I love thee.</p>
              <p> 　　When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, and thou 
                wilt smile.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented 
                himself with folding the paper in four, and added the address:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent's, 
                Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Having folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, 
                drew out his pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the 
                same pencil, these four lines on the first page:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is Marius Pontmercy.</p>
              <p> 　　Carry my body to my grandfather, M. Gillenormand, Rue des 
                Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　The gamin, at the sound of Marius' voice, ran up to him with 
                his merry and devoted air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you do something for me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Anything,&quot; said Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good God! if it had not been for you, I should have 
                been done for.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you see this letter?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take it.</p>
              <p> 　　Leave the barricade instantly&quot; (Gavroche began to scratch 
                his ear uneasily) &quot;and to-morrow morning, you will deliver 
                it at its address to Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent's, 
                Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The heroic child replied</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, 
                and I shall not be there.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The barricade will not be attacked until daybreak, according 
                to all appearances, and will not be taken before to-morrow noon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the 
                barricade had, in fact, been prolonged.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in 
                nocturnal combats, which are always followed by an increase of 
                rage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Gavroche, &quot;what if I were to go 
                and carry your letter to-morrow?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It will be too late.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade will probably be blockaded, all the streets 
                will be guarded, and you will not be able to get out. Go at once.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there 
                in indecision, scratching his ear sadly.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike 
                movements which were common with him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;All right,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　And he started off at a run through Mondetour lane.</p>
              <p> 　　An idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to 
                a decision, but he had not mentioned it for fear that Marius might 
                offer some objection to it.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the idea:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is barely midnight, the Rue de l'Homme Arme is not 
                far off; I will go and deliver the letter at once, and I shall 
                get back in time.&quot;</p>

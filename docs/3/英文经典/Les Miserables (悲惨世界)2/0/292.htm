              <p> 　　As yet, nothing had come.</p>
              <p> 　　Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry. Enjolras and Combeferre 
                had gone and seated themselves, carbines in hand, near the outlet 
                of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed each other, they 
                listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant 
                sound of marching.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young 
                voice, which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and 
                began to sing distinctly, to the old popular air of &quot;By the 
                Light of the Moon,&quot; this bit of poetry, terminated by a cry 
                like the crow of a cock:--</p>

              <p> 　　 [54] My nose is in tears, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thy 
                gendarmes that I may say a word to them.</p>
              <p> 　　With a blue capote and a chicken in his shako, here's the 
                banlieue, co-cocorico.</p>
              <p> 　　 They pressed each other's hands.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is Gavroche,&quot; said Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is warning us,&quot; said Combeferre.</p>
              <p> 　　A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being 
                more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded 
                into the barricade, all breathless, saying:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My gun!</p>
              <p> 　　Here they are!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the 
                sound of hands seeking their guns became audible.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would you like my carbine?&quot; said Enjolras to the 
                lad.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I want a big gun,&quot; replied Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　And he seized Javert's gun.</p>
              <p> 　　Two sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the 
                same moment as Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and the 
                vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the 
                Lane des Precheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that 
                nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and 
                Halles.</p>
              <p> 　　The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone 
                were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on 
                the flag, offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black 
                door vaguely opened into a smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　Each man had taken up his position for the conflict.</p>
              <p> 　　Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre, 
                Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling 
                inside the large barricade, with their heads on a level with the 
                crest of the barrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed 
                on the stones as though at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready 
                to fire.</p>
              <p> 　　Six, commanded by Feuilly, had installed themselves, with 
                their guns levelled at their shoulders, at the windows of the 
                two stories of Corinthe.</p>
              <p> 　　Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, 
                heavy, and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction 
                of Saint-Leu. This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy 
                and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, 
                with a tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard 
                but this.</p>
              <p> 　　It was that combined silence and sound, of the statue of the 
                commander, but this stony step had something indescribably enormous 
                and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, 
                at the same time, the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard 
                the terrible statue Legion marching onward. This tread drew near; 
                it drew still nearer, and stopped.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard 
                at the end of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that 
                dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic 
                threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved 
                about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees 
                beneath one's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at 
                the moment when one is dropping off to sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminated 
                by the distant reflection of the torch.</p>
              <p> 　　A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, from the depths of this darkness, a voice, which 
                was all the more sinister, since no one was visible, and which 
                appeared to be the gloom itself speaking, shouted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who goes there?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered 
                into position, was heard.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The French Revolution!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fire!&quot; shouted the voice.</p>
              <p> 　　A flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though 
                the door of a furnace had been flung open, and hastily closed 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　The red flag fell. The discharge had been so violent and so 
                dense that it had cut the staff, that is to say, the very tip 
                of the omnibus pole.</p>
              <p> 　　Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses 
                penetrated the barricade and wounded several men.</p>
              <p> 　　The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. 
                The attack had been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection 
                in the boldest.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment 
                at the very least.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Comrades!&quot; shouted Courfeyrac, &quot;let us not 
                waste our powder. Let us wait until they are in the street before 
                replying.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And, above all,&quot; said Enjolras, &quot;let us raise 
                the flag again.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; 
                the troops were re-loading their arms.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is there here with a bold heart?</p>
              <p> 　　Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Not a man responded.</p>
              <p> 　　To mount on the barricade at the very moment when, without 
                any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply death.</p>
              <p> 　　The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras himself felt a thrill.</p>
              <p> 　　He repeated:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Does no one volunteer?&quot;</p>

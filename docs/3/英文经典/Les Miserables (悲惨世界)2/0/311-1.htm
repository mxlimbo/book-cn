              <p> 　　DAWN</p>
              <p> 　　 At that moment, Cosette awoke.</p>
              <p> 　　Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window, 
                facing the East on the back court-yard of the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　She had not been there on the preceding evening, and she had 
                already retired to her chamber when Toussaint had said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It appears that there is a row.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly.</p>
              <p> 　　She had had sweet dreams, which possibly arose from the fact 
                that her little bed was very white.</p>
              <p> 　　Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light.</p>
              <p> 　　She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced 
                on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first 
                thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette 
                felt herself thoroughly reassured.</p>
              <p> 　　Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours previously, passed 
                through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear 
                of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all her might, 
                without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart.</p>
              <p> 　　It was three days since she had seen Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　But she said to herself that he must have received her letter, 
                that he knew where she was, and that he was so clever that he 
                would find means of reaching her.--And that certainly to-day, 
                and perhaps that very morning.--It was broad daylight, but the 
                rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was very 
                early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive 
                Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that, 
                consequently, that was sufficient and that Marius would come. 
                No objection was valid.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was certain.</p>
              <p> 　　It was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three 
                days.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius absent three days, this was horrible on the part of 
                the good God.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through 
                with.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was about to arrive, and he would bring good news.</p>
              <p> 　　Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow 
                useless and does not accept it.</p>
              <p> 　　Youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown 
                quantity, which is itself.</p>
              <p> 　　It is natural to it to be happy. It seems as though its respiration 
                were made of hope.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said 
                to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one 
                day, and what explanation of it he had given her.</p>
              <p> 　　Every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one 
                has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides, and with what 
                art it renders itself undiscoverable. There are thoughts which 
                play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of our brain; 
                that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to lay 
                the memory on them.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made 
                by her memory.</p>
              <p> 　　She told herself, that it was very naughty and very wicked 
                of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of 
                soul and body, her prayers and her toilet.</p>
              <p> 　　One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into 
                a nuptial chamber, not into a virginal chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　Verse would hardly venture it, prose must not.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it 
                is whiteness in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, 
                which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not 
                gazed upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　Woman in the bud is sacred.</p>
              <p> 　　That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nudity which 
                is afraid of itself, that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper, 
                that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror 
                were an eye, that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal 
                the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle, 
                those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those 
                tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite affright 
                in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there is 
                no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming 
                as the clouds of dawn,-- it is not fitting that all this should 
                be narrated, and it is too much to have even called attention 
                to it.</p>
              <p> 　　The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the 
                rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a 
                star. The possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation 
                of respect. The down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the 
                radiated crystal of <br>
                the snow, the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are 
                coarse compared to that chastity which does not even know that 
                it is chaste. The young girl is only the flash of a dream, and 
                is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part 
                of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this 
                vague penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter 
                of Cosette's rising.</p>
              <p> 　　An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, 
                but that Adam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she 
                was ashamed and turned crimson.</p>
              <p> 　　We are of the number who fall speechless in the presence of 
                young girls and flowers, since we think them worthy of veneration.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her 
                hair, which was a very simple matter in those days, when women 
                did not swell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, 
                and did not put crinoline in their locks.</p>
              <p> 　　Then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her in 
                every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street, an angle 
                of the house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able to 
                watch for Marius there.</p>
              <p> 　　But no view of the outside was to be had.</p>
              <p> 　　The back court was surrounded by tolerably high walls, and 
                the outlook was only on several gardens. Cosette pronounced these 
                gardens hideous:</p>
              <p> 　　for the first time in her life, she found flowers ugly.</p>
              <p> 　　The smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have 
                met her wishes better.</p>
              <p> 　　She decided to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that 
                Marius might come from that quarter.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, she burst into tears.</p>
              <p> 　　Not that this was fickleness of soul; but hopes cut in twain 
                by dejection--that was her case. She had a confused consciousness 
                of something horrible.</p>
              <p> 　　Thoughts were rife in the air, in fact.</p>
              <p> 　　She told herself that she was not sure of anything, that to 
                withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that 
                Marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer 
                charming but mournful.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, 
                and hope and a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated 
                trust in God.</p>
              <p> 　　Every one in the house was still asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　A country-like silence reigned. Not a shutter had been opened.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter's lodge was closed. Toussaint had not risen, and 
                Cosette, naturally, thought that her father was asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　She must have suffered much, and she must have still been 
                suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had 
                been unkind; but she counted on Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The eclipse of such a light was decidedly impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the distance, and 
                she said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is odd that people should be opening and shutting 
                their carriage gates so early.&quot; They were the reports of 
                the cannon battering the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectly 
                black cornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve 
                of this nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice, so 
                that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise. 
                The mother was there, spreading her wings like a fan over her 
                brood; the father fluttered about, flew away, then came back, 
                bearing in his beak food and kisses.</p>
              <p> 　　The dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, &quot;Multiply,&quot; 
                lay there smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded 
                in the glory of the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul absorbed 
                in chimeras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn without, 
                bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to herself 
                that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze 
                at these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that 
                mother and her little ones, with the profound trouble which a 
                nest produces on a virgin.</p>

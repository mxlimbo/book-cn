              <p> 　　 Marius was, in fact, a prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　The hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp 
                he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness 
                was that of Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to 
                expose himself in it.</p>
              <p> 　　Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme phase of 
                agony, would have thought of the wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to him, everywhere present in the carnage, like a providence, 
                those who fell were picked up, transported to the tap-room, and 
                cared for. In the intervals, he reappeared on the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　But nothing which could resemble a blow, an attack or even 
                personal defence proceeded from his hands.</p>
              <p> 　　He held his peace and lent succor. Moreover he had received 
                only a few scratches.</p>
              <p> 　　The bullets would have none of him.</p>
              <p> 　　If suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming 
                to this sepulchre, to that spot, he had not succeeded. But we 
                doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an irreligious act.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear 
                to see Marius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from 
                the latter. When a shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward 
                with the agility of a tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and 
                bore him off.</p>
              <p> 　　The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently 
                concentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, 
                that no one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in 
                his arms, traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear 
                behind the angle of the Corinthe building.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape 
                on the street; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, 
                and all eyes, and a few square feet of space.</p>
              <p> 　　There is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst 
                of a conflagration, and in the midst of raging seas, beyond a 
                promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals, a tranquil 
                nook.</p>
              <p> 　　It was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the 
                barricade, that Eponine had breathed her last.</p>
              <p> 　　There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, 
                placed his back against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.</p>
              <p> 　　The situation was alarming.</p>
              <p> 　　For an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall 
                was a shelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre?</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau 
                eight years before, and in what manner he had contrived to make 
                his escape; it was difficult then, to-day it was impossible.</p>
              <p> 　　He had before him that deaf and implacable house, six stories 
                in height, which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning 
                out of his window; he had on his right the rather low barricade, 
                which shut off the Rue de la Petite Truanderie; to pass this obstacle 
                seemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets 
                was visible. The troops of the line were posted on the watch behind 
                that barricade. It was evident, that to pass the barricade was 
                to go in quest of the fire of the platoon, and that any head which 
                should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall 
                of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots.</p>
              <p> 　　On his left he had the field of battle. Death lurked round 
                the corner of that wall.</p>
              <p> 　　What was to be done?</p>
              <p> 　　Only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.</p>
              <p> 　　And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some 
                expedient, to come to some decision.</p>
              <p> 　　Fighting was going on a few paces away; fortunately, all were 
                raging around a single point, the door of the wine-shop; but if 
                it should occur to one soldier, to one single soldier, to turn 
                the corner of the house, or to attack him on the flank, all was 
                over.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the 
                barricade at one side of him, then he looked at the ground, with 
                the violence of the last extremity, bewildered, and as though 
                he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an 
                agony began to assume form and outline at his feet, as though 
                it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold. 
                A few paces distant he perceived, at the base of the small barrier 
                so pitilessly guarded and watched on the exterior, beneath a disordered 
                mass of paving-stones which partly concealed it, an iron grating, 
                placed flat and on a level with the soil.</p>
              <p> 　　This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was about two 
                feet square. The frame of paving-stones which supported it had 
                been torn up, and it was, as it were, unfastened.</p>
              <p> 　　Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something 
                like the flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean 
                darted forward.</p>
              <p> 　　His old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination.</p>
              <p> 　　To thrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift 
                Marius, who was as inert as a dead body, upon his shoulders, to 
                descend, with this burden on his loins, and with the aid of his 
                elbows and knees into that sort of well, fortunately not very 
                deep, to let the heavy trap, upon which the loosened stones rolled 
                down afresh, fall into its place behind him, to gain his footing 
                on a flagged surface three metres below the surface,--all this 
                was executed like that which one does in dreams, with the strength 
                of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took only a few 
                minutes.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, 
                in a sort of long, subterranean corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　There reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.</p>
              <p> 　　The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling 
                from the wall into the convent recurred to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, what he was carrying to-day was not Cosette; it was 
                Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　He could barely hear the formidable tumult in the wine-shop, 
                taken by assault, like a vague murmur overhead.</p>

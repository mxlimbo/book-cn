              <p> 　　DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER</p>
              <p> 　　 Bossuet muttered in Combeferre's ear:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He did not answer my question.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a man who does good by gun-shots,&quot; said Combeferre.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant 
                epoch know that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant 
                against insurrections.</p>
              <p> 　　It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of June, 
                1832.</p>
              <p> 　　A certain good dram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus or la 
                Cunette, whose &quot;establishment&quot; had been closed by the 
                riots, became leonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, 
                and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a 
                tea-garden. In that bourgeois and heroic time, in the presence 
                of ideas which had their knights, interests had their paladins. 
                The prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery 
                of the movement.</p>
              <p> 　　The diminution of a pile of crowns made bankers sing the Marseillaise.</p>
              <p> 　　They shed their blood lyrically for the counting-house; and 
                they defended the shop, that immense diminutive of the fatherland, 
                with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm.</p>
              <p> 　　At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this 
                that was not extremely serious.</p>
              <p> 　　It was social elements entering into strife, while awaiting 
                the day when they should enter into equilibrium.</p>
              <p> 　　Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism 
                [the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order 
                in combination with lack of discipline.</p>
              <p> 　　The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of 
                such or such a Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a 
                captain went into action through inspiration; such and such National 
                Guardsmen fought, &quot;for an idea,&quot; and on their own account.</p>
              <p> 　　At critical moments, on &quot;days&quot; they took counsel 
                less of their leaders than of their instincts. There existed in 
                the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword, like 
                Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrede.</p>
              <p> 　　Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather 
                by an aggregation of interests than by a group of principles, 
                was or thought itself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, 
                constituting himself a centre, defended it, succored it, and protected 
                it with his own head; and the first comer took it upon himself 
                to save society.</p>
              <p> 　　Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination.</p>
              <p> 　　A platoon of the National Guard would constitute itself on 
                its own authority a private council of war, and judge and execute 
                a captured insurgent in five minutes. It was an improvisation 
                of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. Fierce Lynch law, 
                with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest, for 
                it has been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by 
                the monarchy in Europe.</p>
              <p> 　　This Lynch law was complicated with mistakes.</p>
              <p> 　　On one day of rioting, a young poet, named Paul Aime Garnier, 
                was pursued in the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, 
                and only escaped by taking refuge under the porte-cochere of No. 
                6.</p>
              <p> 　　They shouted:--&quot;There's another of those Saint-Simonians!&quot; 
                and they wanted to kill him.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc 
                de Saint-Simon. A National Guard had read the words Saint-Simon 
                on the book, and had shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Death!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards 
                from the suburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, 
                had itself decimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice 
                and its own good pleasure.</p>
              <p> 　　This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at the 
                judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection 
                of 1832.</p>
              <p> 　　Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort of 
                condottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized, 
                a fanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not resist 
                the temptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing 
                the barricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company.</p>
              <p> 　　Exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and 
                the old coat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed 
                the generals and chiefs of the corps, who were holding council 
                and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had 
                arrived, and who were allowing &quot;the insurrection to fry in 
                its own fat,&quot; to use the celebrated expression of one of 
                them. For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as that 
                which is ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.</p>
              <p> 　　He commanded men as resolute as himself, &quot;raging fellows,&quot; 
                as a witness said.</p>
              <p> 　　His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, 
                was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. 
                At the moment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched 
                his men against the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　This movement, executed with more good will than strategy, 
                cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed two thirds 
                of the street it was received by a general discharge from the 
                barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front, were 
                mown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and this 
                courageous throng of National Guards, very brave men but lacking 
                in military tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation, 
                leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation 
                gave the insurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second 
                and very destructive discharge struck the company before it could 
                regain the corner of the street, its shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment more, and it was caught between two fires, and it 
                received the volley from the battery piece which, not having received 
                the order, had not discontinued its firing.</p>
              <p> 　　The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from 
                this grape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, 
                by order.</p>
              <p> 　　This attack, which was more furious than serious, irritated 
                Enjolras.--&quot;The fools!&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are getting their own men killed and they are using 
                up our ammunition for nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which 
                he was. Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons. 
                Insurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain 
                number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to 
                expend. An empty cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced.</p>
              <p> 　　As repression has the army, it does not count its men, and, 
                as it has Vincennes, it does not count its shots.</p>
              <p> 　　Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men, 
                and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus 
                they are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end 
                in crushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly, 
                flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. This does 
                happen sometimes.</p>
              <p> 　　Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe, popular 
                redoubts abound.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris quivers supremely, the quid divinum is given forth, 
                a 10th of August is in the air, a 29th of July is in the air, 
                a wonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force draws back, 
                and the army, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that 
                prophet, France.</p>

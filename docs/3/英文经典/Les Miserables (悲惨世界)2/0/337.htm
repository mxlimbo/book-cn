              <p> 　　THE FONTIS</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.</p>
              <p> 　　This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil 
                of the Champs-Elysees, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works 
                and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions, on account 
                of its excessive fluidity.</p>
              <p> 　　This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands 
                of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by 
                a stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey 
                strata, infected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which 
                are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was effected 
                under the gallery des Martyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe.</p>
              <p> 　　When, in 1836, the old stone sewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honore, 
                in which we now see Jean Valjean, was demolished for the purpose 
                of reconstructing it, the quicksand, which forms the subsoil of 
                the Champs-Elysees as far as the Seine, presented such an obstacle, 
                that the operation lasted nearly six months, to the great clamor 
                of the dwellers on the riverside, particularly those who had hotels 
                and carriages.</p>
              <p> 　　The work was more than unhealthy; it was dangerous.</p>
              <p> 　　It is true that they had four months and a half of rain, and 
                three floods of the Seine.</p>
              <p> 　　The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by 
                the downpour of the preceding day.</p>
              <p> 　　The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent sand, had given 
                way and had produced a stoppage of the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Infiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated 
                bottom had sunk into the ooze.</p>
              <p> 　　To what extent? Impossible to say.</p>
              <p> 　　The obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere. It was 
                a pit of mire in a cavern of night.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. 
                He entered this slime.</p>
              <p> 　　There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　He must pass it.</p>
              <p> 　　To retrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and 
                Jean Valjean exhausted.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, where was he to go?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean advanced.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to 
                be very deep.</p>
              <p> 　　But in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon he had the slime up to his calves and water above his 
                knees.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked on, raising Marius in his arms, as far above the 
                water as he could. The mire now reached to his knees, and the 
                water to his waist. He could no longer retreat.</p>
              <p> 　　This mud, dense enough for one man, could not, obviously, 
                uphold two.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance of extricating 
                themselves singly.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean continued to advance, supporting the dying man, 
                who was, perhaps, a corpse.</p>
              <p> 　　The water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; 
                it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of 
                ooze which he had now reached.</p>
              <p> 　　The density, which was his support, was also an obstacle.</p>
              <p> 　　He still held Marius on high, and with an unheard-of expenditure 
                of force, he advanced still; but he was sinking. He had only his 
                head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　In the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding 
                her child thus.</p>
              <p> 　　He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape 
                the water, and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone 
                who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he 
                beheld was a mask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint glimpse 
                above him of the drooping head and livid face of Marius; he made 
                a desperate effort and launched his foot forward; his foot struck 
                something solid; a point of support.</p>
              <p> 　　It was high time.</p>
              <p> 　　He straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point 
                of support with a sort of fury.</p>
              <p> 　　This produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase 
                leading back to life.</p>
              <p> 　　The point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the 
                supreme moment, was the beginning of the other water-shed of the 
                pavement, which had bent but had not given way, and which had 
                curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece.</p>
              <p> 　　Well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of 
                firmness.</p>
              <p> 　　This fragment of the vaulting, partly submerged, but solid, 
                was a veritable inclined plane, and, once on this plane, he was 
                safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other 
                side of the quagmire.</p>
              <p> 　　As he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone 
                and fell upon his knees.</p>
              <p> 　　He reflected that this was but just, and he remained there 
                for some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.</p>
              <p> 　　He rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed 
                beneath the dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping 
                with slime, and his soul filled with a strange light.</p>

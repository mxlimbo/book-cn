              <p> 　　 Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike 
                firmly and choose well.</p>
              <p> 　　Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the 
                state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they 
                nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent 
                them from falling amiss.</p>
              <p> 　　Their eclipse is never an abdication.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also 
                may be deceived, and grave errors have been seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us return to 1830.</p>
              <p> 　　1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the establishment 
                which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut 
                short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe 
                was a rare man.</p>
              <p> 　　The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating 
                circumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had 
                been of blame; possessing all private virtues and many public 
                virtues; careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, 
                of his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the 
                value of a year; sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man 
                and a good prince; sleeping with his wife, and having in his palace 
                lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the 
                bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which 
                had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the 
                elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and, what is 
                more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking them; 
                an admirable representative of the &quot;middle class,&quot; but 
                outstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing 
                excellent sense, while appreciating the blood from which he had 
                sprung, counting most of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the 
                question of his race, very particular, declaring himself Orleans 
                and not Bourbon; thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal 
                while he was still only a Serene Highness, but a frank bourgeois 
                from the day he became king; diffuse in public, concise in private; 
                reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at bottom, one of those 
                economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty; 
                lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman, but 
                not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family 
                and his household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, 
                inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing 
                at the shortest range, incapable of rancor and of gratitude, making 
                use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever in getting 
                parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious 
                unanimities which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved, sometimes 
                imprudent in his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address 
                in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in countenances, in 
                masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably 
                fond of his country, but preferring his family; assuming more 
                domination than authority and more authority than dignity, a disposition 
                which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns everything 
                to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate 
                baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it preserves 
                politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society 
                from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, 
                indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself 
                the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England 
                in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing 
                the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, 
                to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal, to 
                daring generosity, to Utopia, to chimeras, to wrath, to vanity, 
                to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a general 
                at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked eight times by regicides 
                and always smiling.</p>
              <p> 　　brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only 
                in the face of the chances of a European shaking up, and unfitted 
                for great political adventures; always ready to risk his life, 
                never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order that 
                he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king; endowed 
                with observation and not with divination; not very attentive to 
                minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order 
                to judge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, 
                easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, 
                his only point of resemblance with Caesar, Alexander, and Napoleon; 
                knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of 
                tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior 
                aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls, in a word, 
                all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences; 
                accepted by the surface, but little in accord with France lower 
                down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing too much 
                and not enough; his own first minister; excellent at creating 
                out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity 
                of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, 
                of order and organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings 
                and chicanery, the founder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something 
                of Charlemagne and something of an attorney; in short, a lofty 
                and original figure, a prince who understood how to create authority 
                in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite of the 
                jealousy of Europe.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his 
                century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors 
                of history had he loved glory but a little, and if he had had 
                the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling 
                for what is useful.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained 
                graceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so 
                by the masses; he pleased.</p>
              <p> 　　He had that gift of charming.</p>
              <p> 　　He lacked majesty; he wore no crown, although a king, and 
                no white hair, although an old man; his manners belonged to the 
                old regime and his habits to the new; a mixture of the noble and 
                the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe was transition 
                reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient 
                orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern; 
                he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote les Polonois, and he 
                pronounced les Hongrais.</p>
              <p> 　　He wore the uniform of the national guard, like Charles X., 
                and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never 
                to the opera. Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by 
                ballet-dancers; this made a part of his bourgeois popularity.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no heart. He went out with his umbrella under his arm, 
                and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, something of 
                a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; 
                Louis Philippe no more went about without his lancet, than did 
                Henri IV.</p>
              <p> 　　without his poniard.</p>
              <p> 　　The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, the first who 
                had ever shed blood with the object of healing.</p>
              <p> 　　For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction 
                to be made; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses 
                the reign, that which accuses the King; three columns which all 
                give different totals.</p>
              <p> 　　Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a matter of 
                secondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed, 
                military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by 
                arms, the Rue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption 
                of the real country by the legal country, on half shares with 
                three hundred thousand privileged persons,-- these are the deeds 
                of royalty; Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, 
                as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than 
                civilization, the breach of faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz 
                bought, Pritchard paid,--these are the doings of the reign; the 
                policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of 
                the King.</p>
              <p> 　　As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the 
                King's charge is decreased.</p>
              <p> 　　This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.</p>
              <p> 　　Whence arises this fault?</p>
              <p> 　　We will state it.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that 
                incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is 
                afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed; hence 
                excessive timidity, which is displeasing to the people, who have 
                the 14th of July in their civil and Austerlitz in their military 
                tradition.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to 
                be fulfilled first of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe 
                towards his family was deserved by the family.</p>
              <p> 　　That domestic group was worthy of admiration.</p>
              <p> 　　Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis 
                Philippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name of her 
                race among artists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it among poets.</p>
              <p> 　　She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne d'Arc. 
                Two of Louis Philippe's daughters elicited from Metternich this 
                eulogium:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are young people such as are rarely seen, and princes 
                such as are never seen.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, 
                is the truth about Louis Philippe.</p>
              <p> 　　To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction 
                of the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting 
                side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing 
                power, therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never 
                was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event; the 
                one entered into the other, and the incarnation took place. Louis 
                Philippe is 1830 made man.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had in his favor that great recommendation to 
                the throne, exile.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor.</p>
              <p> 　　He had lived by his own labor.</p>
              <p> 　　In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains 
                in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread.</p>
              <p> 　　At Reichenau, he gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister 
                Adelaide did wool work and sewed. These souvenirs connected with 
                a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic.</p>
              <p> 　　He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel, 
                built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was the companion 
                of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged 
                to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; 
                Danton had said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Young man!&quot; At the age of four and twenty, in '93, 
                being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of 
                a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so well named that poor tyrant.</p>
              <p> 　　The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty 
                in the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing 
                the man in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of 
                the Assembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capet not 
                knowing what to reply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by 
                that royal head beneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence 
                of all in that catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as 
                of the man condemned,--he had looked on those things, he had contemplated 
                that giddiness; he had seen the centuries appear before the bar 
                of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind Louis XVI., 
                that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the terrible 
                culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows; and there had 
                lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices 
                of the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice 
                of God.</p>
              <p> 　　The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious.</p>
              <p> 　　Its memory was like a living imprint of those great years, 
                minute by minute. One day, in the presence of a witness whom we 
                are not permitted to doubt, he rectified from memory the whole 
                of the letter A in the alphabetical list of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　While he reigned the press was free, the tribune was free, 
                conscience and speech were free.</p>
              <p> 　　The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware 
                of the gnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne 
                exposed to the light.</p>
              <p> 　　History will do justice to him for this loyalty.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from 
                the scene, is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience.</p>
              <p> 　　His case is, as yet, only in the lower court.</p>
              <p> 　　The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, 
                has not yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce 
                a definite judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious 
                historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his first 
                verdict; Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which 
                are called the 221 and 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, 
                and a half-revolution; and in any case, from the superior point 
                of view where philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him 
                here, as the reader has seen above, except with certain reservations 
                in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in the eyes 
                of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in 
                the first place, the right of the people in the second, all is 
                usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, that 
                after making these reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and 
                in whatever manner he is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in 
                himself, and from the point of view of human goodness, will remain, 
                to use the antique language of ancient history, one of the best 
                princes who ever sat on a throne.</p>
              <p> 　　What is there against him?</p>
              <p> 　　That throne.</p>
              <p> 　　Take away Louis Philippe the king, there remains the man.</p>
              <p> 　　And the man is good.</p>
              <p> 　　He is good at times even to the point of being admirable.</p>
              <p> 　　Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day 
                of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned 
                at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, 
                overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a death sentence 
                and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering 
                it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a 
                still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He 
                obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; 
                he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against 
                the crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law, as he called 
                them. Sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table; he examined 
                them all; it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned 
                heads. One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have recently 
                referred: &quot;I won seven last night.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　During the early years of his reign, the death penalty was 
                as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence 
                committed against the King.</p>
              <p> 　　The Greve having disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois 
                place of execution was instituted under the name of the Barriere-Saint-Jacques; 
                &quot;practical men&quot; felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate 
                guillotine; and this was one of the victories of Casimir Perier, 
                who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis 
                Philippe, who represented its liberal sides.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand.</p>
              <p> 　　After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: &quot;What a pity 
                that I was not wounded!</p>
              <p> 　　Then I might have pardoned!&quot; On another occasion, alluding 
                to the resistance offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection 
                with a political criminal, who is one of the most generous figures 
                of our day:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His pardon is granted; it only remains for me to obtain 
                it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as 
                Henri IV.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest 
                of pearls, the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the 
                man who is great.</p>
              <p> 　　Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, 
                perhaps, by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a 
                phantom at the present day, who knew that king, should come and 
                testify in his favor before history; this deposition, whatever 
                else it may be, is evidently and above all things, entirely disinterested; 
                an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console 
                another shade; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right 
                to praise it; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever 
                be said of two tombs in exile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This one flattered the other.&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　BADLY SEWED</p>
              <p> 　　 But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men 
                is another. The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make 
                haste to prepare the shipwreck.</p>
              <p> 　　The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the 
                title of Statesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by 
                becoming somewhat of a slang word.</p>
              <p> 　　It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there is 
                nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say &quot;the 
                skilful&quot; amounts to saying &quot;the mediocre.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the same way, to say &quot;statesmen&quot; is sometimes 
                equivalent to saying &quot;traitors.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like 
                the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature 
                is indispensable.</p>
              <p> 　　The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right 
                once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once 
                assured, attention must be directed to power.</p>
              <p> 　　Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, 
                but they begin to be distrustful.</p>
              <p> 　　Power, very good.</p>
              <p> 　　But, in the first place, what is power?</p>
              <p> 　　In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to 
                hear the murmured objection, and they continue their manoeuvres.</p>
              <p> 　　According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting 
                the mask of necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement 
                of a people after a revolution, when this people forms part of 
                a monarchical continent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In 
                this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time to dress our wounds, 
                and to repair the house, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty 
                conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is 
                not always easy to procure a dynasty.</p>
              <p> 　　If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or 
                even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the 
                manufacturing of a king.</p>
              <p> 　　You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.</p>
              <p> 　　But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to 
                make a dynasty.</p>
              <p> 　　There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity 
                in a race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.</p>
              <p> 　　If we place ourselves at the point of view of the &quot;statesmen,&quot; 
                after making all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what 
                are the qualities of the king which result from it?</p>
              <p> 　　He may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary; 
                that is to say, a participant in his own person in that revolution, 
                that he should have lent a hand to it, that he should have either 
                compromised or distinguished himself therein, that he should have 
                touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.</p>
              <p> 　　What are the qualities of a dynasty?</p>
              <p> 　　It should be national; that is to say, revolutionary at a 
                distance, not through acts committed, but by reason of ideas accepted.</p>
              <p> 　　It should be composed of past and be historic; be composed 
                of future and be sympathetic.</p>
              <p> 　　All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves 
                with finding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely 
                insisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House 
                of Orleans.</p>
              <p> 　　Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch 
                of which, bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a 
                fig-tree itself. Each branch may become a dynasty.</p>
              <p> 　　On the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is the theory of the skilful.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, then, lies the great art:</p>
              <p> 　　to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe 
                in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it also, 
                to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment the curve 
                of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull 
                that aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, 
                to cut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, 
                to envelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very 
                speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules 
                on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the 
                expedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar 
                thinned out with a potion, to take one's precautions against too 
                much success, to garnish the revolution with a shade.</p>
              <p> 　　1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 
                1688.</p>
              <p> 　　1830 is a revolution arrested midway.</p>
              <p> 　　Half of progress, quasi-right. Now, logic knows not the &quot;almost,&quot; 
                absolutely as the sun knows not the candle.</p>
              <p> 　　Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction. 
                Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it 
                will be satiety.</p>
              <p> 　　The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 
                after Charles X.</p>
              <p> 　　The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of 
                the bourgeoisie.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair 
                is not a caste.</p>
              <p> 　　But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest 
                the very march of the human race.</p>
              <p> 　　This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.</p>
              <p> 　　One is not a class because one has committed a fault.</p>
              <p> 　　Selfishness is not one of the divisions of the social order.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, we must be just to selfishness.</p>
              <p> 　　The state to which that part of the nation which is called 
                the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of 1830 was not the inertia 
                which is complicated with indifference and laziness, and which 
                contains a little shame; it was not the slumber which presupposes 
                a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was the halt.</p>
              <p> 　　The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost 
                contradictory sense:</p>
              <p> 　　a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that 
                is to say, repose.</p>
              <p> 　　The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed 
                and on the alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels 
                and holds itself on its guard.</p>
              <p> 　　The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat 
                of to-morrow.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.</p>
              <p> 　　What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.</p>
              <p> 　　The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a 
                man who should express this word Halt.</p>
              <p> 　　An Although-Because. A composite individuality, signifying 
                revolution and signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening 
                the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the 
                future.</p>
              <p> 　　This man was &quot;already found.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His name was Louis Philippe d'Orleans.</p>
              <p> 　　The 221 made Louis Philippe King.</p>
              <p> 　　Lafayette undertook the coronation.</p>
              <p> 　　He called it the best of republics.</p>
              <p> 　　The town-hall of Paris took the place of the Cathedral of 
                Rheims.</p>
              <p> 　　This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was 
                &quot;the work of 1830.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution 
                became apparent.</p>
              <p> 　　All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute 
                right.</p>
              <p> 　　Absolute right cried: &quot;I protest!&quot; then, terrible 
                to say, it retired into the darkness.</p>

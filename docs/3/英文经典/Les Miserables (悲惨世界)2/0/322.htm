              <p> 　　THE HEROES</p>
              <p> 　　 All at once, the drum beat the charge.</p>
              <p> 　　The attack was a hurricane.</p>
              <p> 　　On the evening before, in the darkness, the barricade had 
                been approached silently, as by a boa.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, in broad daylight, in that widening street, surprise 
                was decidedly impossible, rude force had, moreover, been unmasked, 
                the cannon had begun the roar, the army hurled itself on the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Fury now became skill. A powerful detachment of infantry of 
                the line, broken at regular intervals, by the National Guard and 
                the Municipal Guard on foot, and supported by serried masses which 
                could be heard though not seen, debauched into the street at a 
                run, with drums beating, trumpets braying, bayonets levelled, 
                the sappers at their head, and, imperturbable under the projectiles, 
                charged straight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen 
                beam against a wall.</p>
              <p> 　　The wall held firm.</p>
              <p> 　　The insurgents fired impetuously.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade once scaled had a mane of lightning flashes.</p>
              <p> 　　The assault was so furious, that for one moment, it was inundated 
                with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes 
                off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff 
                is covered with foam, to re-appear, a moment later, beetling, 
                black and formidable.</p>
              <p> 　　The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street, 
                unprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible 
                discharge of musketry.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who has seen fireworks will recall the sheaf formed 
                of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. Let the reader 
                picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical but horizontal, 
                bearing a bullet, buck-shot or a biscaien at the tip of each one 
                of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men one after another 
                from its clusters of lightning.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade was underneath it.</p>
              <p> 　　On both sides, the resolution was equal.</p>
              <p> 　　The bravery exhibited there was almost barbarous and was complicated 
                with a sort of heroic ferocity which began by the sacrifice of 
                self.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a 
                Zouave. The troop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was 
                desirous of fighting.</p>
              <p> 　　The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and 
                in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this 
                fray, each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. 
                The street was strewn with corpses.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius 
                at the other.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved 
                and sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, 
                under his embrasure, without having even seen him; Marius fought 
                unprotected.</p>
              <p> 　　He made himself a target.</p>
              <p> 　　He stood with more than half his body above the breastworks.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious man 
                who takes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible 
                in action than a dreamer. Marius was formidable and pensive.</p>
              <p> 　　In battle he was as in a dream. One would have pronounced 
                him a phantom engaged in firing a gun.</p>
              <p> 　　The insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their 
                sarcasms. In this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, 
                they laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac was bare-headed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have you done with your hat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet asked him.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Or they uttered haughty comments.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Can any one understand,&quot; exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, 
                &quot;those men,--[and he cited names, well-known names, even 
                celebrated names, some belonging to the old army]--who had promised 
                to join us, and taken an oath to aid us, and who had pledged their 
                honor to it, and who are our generals, and who abandon us!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave 
                smile.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are people who observe the rules of honor as one 
                observes the stars, from a great distance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges 
                that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm.</p>
              <p> 　　The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents 
                had position. They were at the top of a wall, and they thundered 
                point-blank upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded 
                and entangled in the escarpment.</p>
              <p> 　　This barricade, constructed as it was and admirably buttressed, 
                was really one of those situations where a handful of men hold 
                a legion in check.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantly recruited and 
                enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorably nearer, 
                and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the army 
                closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.</p>
              <p> 　　One assault followed another.</p>
              <p> 　　The horror of the situation kept increasing.</p>
              <p> 　　Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that 
                Rue de la Chanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. These 
                haggard, ragged, exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for 
                four and twenty hours, who had not slept, who had but a few more 
                rounds to fire, who were fumbling in their pockets which had been 
                emptied of cartridges, nearly all of whom were wounded, with head 
                or arm bandaged with black and blood-stained linen, with holes 
                in their clothes from which the blood trickled, and who were hardly 
                armed with poor guns and notched swords, became Titans. The barricade 
                was ten times attacked, approached, assailed, scaled, and never 
                captured.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary 
                to imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then 
                to gaze at the conflagration.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace; there 
                mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.</p>
              <p> 　　The human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed 
                forth there, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming 
                in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray.</p>
              <p> 　　The successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter 
                we renounce all attempts at depicting.</p>
              <p> 　　The epic alone has the right to fill twelve thousand verses 
                with a battle.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the 
                most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls 
                the Forest of Swords.</p>
              <p> 　　They fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, 
                with blows of the sword, with their fists, at a distance, close 
                at hand, from above, from below, from everywhere, from the roofs 
                of the houses, from the windows of the wine-shop, from the cellar 
                windows, whither some had crawled.</p>
              <p> 　　They were one against sixty.</p>
              <p> 　　The facade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous.</p>
              <p> 　　The window, tattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass and frame 
                and was nothing now but a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked 
                with paving-stones.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed; 
                Combeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast 
                at the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only 
                time to cast a glance to heaven when he expired.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly 
                in the head, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, 
                and one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras alone was not struck.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had no longer any weapon, he reached out his hands 
                to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm or other into 
                his fist.</p>
              <p> 　　All he had left was the stumps of four swords; one more than 
                Francois I. at Marignan.</p>
              <p> 　　Homer says: &quot;Diomedes cuts the throat of Axylus, son 
                of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy Arisba; Euryalus, son of Mecistaeus, 
                exterminates Dresos and Opheltios, Esepius, and that Pedasus whom 
                the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless Bucolion; Ulysses overthrows 
                Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypaetes, Astyalus; 
                Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon.</p>
              <p> 　　Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike.</p>
              <p> 　　Agamemnon, king of the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born 
                in the rocky city which is laved by the sounding river Satnois.&quot; 
                In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks the giant marquis 
                Swantibore with a cobbler's shoulder-stick of fire, and the latter 
                defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks 
                up by the roots.</p>
              <p> 　　Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne 
                and Bourbon, armed, emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, 
                on horseback and approaching each other, their battle-axes in 
                hand, masked with iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the 
                one caparisoned in ermine, the other draped in azure:</p>
              <p> 　　Bretagne with his lion between the two horns of his crown, 
                Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor.</p>
              <p> 　　But, in order to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like 
                Yvon, the ducal morion, to have in the fist, like Esplandian, 
                a living flame, or, like Phyles, father of Polydamas, to have 
                brought back from Ephyra a good suit of mail, a present from the 
                king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to give one's life for a conviction 
                or a loyalty.</p>
              <p> 　　This ingenuous little soldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce 
                or Limousin, who prowls with his clasp-knife by his side, around 
                the children's nurses in the Luxembourg garden, this pale young 
                student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book, a blond youth 
                who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them, breathe 
                upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in the 
                Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and 
                let the one fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and 
                let both of them imagine that they are fighting for their country; 
                the struggle will be colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit 
                and this sawbones in conflict will produce in that grand epic 
                field where humanity is striving, will equal the shadow cast by 
                Megaryon, King of Lycia, tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace 
                the immense body of Ajax, equal to the gods.</p>

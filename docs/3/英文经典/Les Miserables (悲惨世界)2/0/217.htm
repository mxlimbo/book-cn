              <p> 　　JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES</p>
              <p> 　　A few moments later, about three o'clock, Courfeyrac chanced 
                to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. 
                The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that 
                there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the 
                street towards the barrier with a peculiar air.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hold!&quot; said Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's Marius.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I saw him,&quot; said Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't let's speak to him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is busy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With what?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you see his air?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What air?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has the air of a man who is following some one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's true,&quot; said Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Just see the eyes he is making!&quot; said Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But who the deuce is he following?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Some fine, flowery bonneted wench!</p>
              <p> 　　He's in love.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But,&quot; observed Bossuet, &quot;I don't see any wench 
                nor any flowery bonnet in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　There's not a woman round.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's following a man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could 
                be distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking 
                along about twenty paces in advance of Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new 
                and too large for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all 
                hanging in rags and black with mud.</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet burst out laughing.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is that man?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He?&quot; retorted Courfeyrac, &quot;he's a poet.</p>
              <p> 　　Poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in 
                rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of France.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let's see where Marius will go,&quot; said Bossuet; 
                &quot;let's see where the man is going, let's follow them, hey?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bossuet!&quot; exclaimed Courfeyrac, &quot;eagle of 
                Meaux!</p>
              <p> 　　You are a prodigious brute.</p>
              <p> 　　Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They retraced their steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue 
                Mouffetard, and was spying on his proceedings.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that 
                he was already held by a glance.</p>
              <p> 　　He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one 
                of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained 
                there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. 
                He halted at an ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner 
                of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw 
                him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel 
                with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. 
                At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and 
                proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; 
                the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. 
                Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue 
                du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow 
                Jondrette into it.</p>
              <p> 　　It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity 
                of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the 
                bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that 
                no one was following him, did not see him, then sprang across 
                the wall and disappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the 
                back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had 
                failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under 
                his sheds.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette's 
                absence to return home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, 
                Ma'am Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town, had 
                a habit of locking the door, which was always closed at dusk. 
                Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it was important, 
                therefore, that he should make haste.</p>
              <p> 　　Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon 
                and in the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated 
                by the sun, and that was the moon.</p>
              <p> 　　It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides.</p>
              <p> 　　The door was still open when he arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall 
                of the corridor to his chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　This corridor, as the reader will remember, was bordered on 
                both sides by attics, all of which were, for the moment, empty 
                and to let.</p>
              <p> 　　Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open.</p>
              <p> 　　As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceived 
                in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely 
                lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer 
                window,</p>
              <p> 　　Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. 
                He succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without 
                making any noise.</p>
              <p> 　　It was high time.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later he heard Ma'am Bougon take her departure, locking 
                the door of the house behind her.</p>

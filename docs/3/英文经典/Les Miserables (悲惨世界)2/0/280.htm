              <p> 　　 The band augmented every moment.</p>
              <p> 　　Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of lofty stature, whose 
                hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daring mien was remarked 
                by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whom none of them 
                knew, joined them.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, who was occupied in singing, whistling, humming, 
                running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with 
                the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to this 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in 
                front of Courfeyrac's door.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This happens just right,&quot; said Courfeyrac, &quot;I 
                have forgotten my purse, and I have lost my hat.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed. 
                He seized an old hat and his purse.</p>
              <p> 　　He also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions of 
                a large valise, which was concealed under his soiled linen.</p>
              <p> 　　As he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur de Courfeyrac!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What's your name, portress?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The portress stood bewildered.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why, you know perfectly well, I'm the concierge; my 
                name is Mother Veuvain.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, if you call me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I 
                shall call you Mother de Veuvain.</p>
              <p> 　　Now speak, what's the matter?</p>
              <p> 　　What do you want?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is some one who wants to speak with you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In my lodge.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The devil!&quot; ejaculated Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But the person has been waiting your return for over 
                an hour,&quot; said the portress.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and 
                youthful artisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers 
                of ribbed velvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred 
                as a man than of a man, emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac 
                in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman's 
                voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur Marius, if you please.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is not here.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will he return this evening?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know nothing about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And Courfeyrac added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For my part, I shall not return.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The young man gazed steadily at him and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Because.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going, then?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What business is that of yours?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would you like to have me carry your coffer for you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am going to the barricades.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Would you like to have me go with you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you like!&quot; replied Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The street is free, the pavements belong to every one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he made his escape at a run to join his friends.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had rejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them 
                to carry. It was only a quarter of an hour after this that he 
                saw the young man, who had actually followed them.</p>
              <p> 　　A mob does not go precisely where it intends.</p>
              <p> 　　We have explained that a gust of wind carries it away.</p>
              <p> 　　They overshot Saint-Merry and found themselves, without precisely 
                knowing how, in the Rue Saint-Denis.</p>

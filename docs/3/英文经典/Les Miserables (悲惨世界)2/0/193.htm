              <p> 　　BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY</p>
              <p> 　　 On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew 
                from his wardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, 
                and his new boots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, 
                put on his gloves, a tremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended 
                not to see him.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have just met Marius' new hat and new coat, with Marius 
                inside them.</p>
              <p> 　　He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly 
                stupid.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the 
                fountain basin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for 
                a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly 
                black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing.</p>
              <p> 　　Near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with 
                a prominent stomach, who was holding by the hand a little urchin 
                of five, and saying to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shun excess, my son, keep at an equal distance from 
                despotism and from anarchy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit 
                of the basin once more.</p>
              <p> 　　At last he directed his course towards &quot;his alley,&quot; 
                slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was 
                both forced to go there and withheld from doing so.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not perceive it himself, and thought that he was doing 
                as he always did.</p>
              <p> 　　On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young 
                girl at the other end, &quot;on their bench.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He buttoned his coat up to the very top, pulled it down on 
                his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined, with a 
                certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and 
                marched on the bench.</p>
              <p> 　　This march savored of an attack, and certainly of a desire 
                for conquest.</p>
              <p> 　　So I say that he marched on the bench, as I should say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hannibal marched on Rome.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he 
                had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind 
                and labors.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du Baccalaureat 
                was a stupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare 
                idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy 
                of Moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human 
                mind.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a piercing whistling going on in his ears. As he 
                approached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his coat, and 
                fixed his eyes on the young girl.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the 
                alley with a vague blue light.</p>
              <p> 　　In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and 
                more. On arriving at some little distance from the bench, and 
                long before he had reached the end of the walk, he halted, and 
                could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not even say to himself that he would not go as far 
                as the end.</p>
              <p> 　　It was only with difficulty that the young girl could have 
                perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in 
                his new clothes.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any one 
                should be looking at him from behind.</p>
              <p> 　　He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time 
                he approached a little nearer to the bench.</p>
              <p> 　　He even got to within three intervals of trees, but there 
                he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further, 
                and he hesitated.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought he saw the young girl's face bending towards him.</p>
              <p> 　　But he exerted a manly and violent effort, subdued his hesitation, 
                and walked straight ahead.</p>
              <p> 　　A few seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect 
                and firm, reddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a 
                glance either to the right or to the left, with his hand thrust 
                into his coat like a statesman.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when he passed,-- under the cannon of the place,--he 
                felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore 
                her damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, 
                which must have been &quot;her voice.&quot; She was talking tranquilly.</p>
              <p> 　　She was very pretty.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt it, although he made no attempt to see her.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She could not, however,&quot; he thought, &quot;help 
                feeling esteem and consideration for me, if she only knew that 
                I am the veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obregon 
                de la Ronde, which M. Francois de Neufchateau put, as though it 
                were his own, at the head of his edition of Gil Blas.&quot; He 
                went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk, which 
                was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more in 
                front of the lovely girl.</p>
              <p> 　　This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all his emotions were 
                disagreeable.</p>
              <p> 　　As he went further from the bench and the young girl, and 
                while his back was turned to her, he fancied that she was gazing 
                after him, and that made him stumble.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted 
                near the middle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never 
                did, he sat down, and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct 
                depths of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons 
                whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely 
                insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat.</p>
              <p> 　　At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though 
                he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that 
                bench which was surrounded by an aureole.</p>
              <p> 　　But he remained standing there, motionless.</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that 
                that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, 
                on his side, noticed him, and probably considered his assiduity 
                singular.</p>
              <p> 　　For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence 
                in designating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by 
                the sobriquet of M. le Blanc.</p>
              <p> 　　He stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing 
                figures in the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, 
                to M. Leblanc and his daughter, and went home.</p>
              <p> 　　That day he forgot to dine.</p>
              <p> 　　At eight o'clock in the evening he perceived this fact, and 
                as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques, he said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind!&quot; and ate a bit of bread.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded 
                it up with great care.</p>

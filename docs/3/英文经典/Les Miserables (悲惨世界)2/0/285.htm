              <p> 　　The journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable 
                structure, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they 
                call it, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken.</p>
              <p> 　　The fact is, that it did not exceed an average height of six 
                or seven feet. It was built in such a manner that the combatants 
                could, at their will, either disappear behind it or dominate the 
                barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of 
                paving-stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps 
                in the interior.</p>
              <p> 　　On the outside, the front of the barricade, composed of piles 
                of paving-stones and casks bound together by beams and planks, 
                which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau's dray and of the 
                overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.</p>
              <p> 　　An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had 
                been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of 
                the barricade which was furthest from the wine-shop, so that an 
                exit was possible at this point.</p>
              <p> 　　The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with 
                ropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the 
                barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　The little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop 
                building, was not visible.</p>
              <p> 　　The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt. Enjolras 
                and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment 
                of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des Precheurs 
                an issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible 
                communication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear 
                of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the 
                Rue des Precheurs.</p>
              <p> 　　With the exception of this issue which was left free, and 
                which constituted what Folard in his strategical style would have 
                termed a branch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting 
                arranged on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, 
                where the wine-shop formed a salient angle, presented an irregular 
                square, closed on all sides.</p>
              <p> 　　There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand 
                barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the 
                street, so that one might say that the barricade rested on these 
                houses, all inhabited, but closed from top to bottom.</p>
              <p> 　　All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less 
                than an hour, and without this handful of bold men seeing a single 
                bear-skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance. The very 
                bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter the 
                Rue Saint-Denis cast a glance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught 
                sight of the barricade, and redoubled their pace.</p>
              <p> 　　The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a 
                table was dragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted 
                on the table. Enjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac 
                opened it. This coffer was filled with cartridges.</p>
              <p> 　　When the mob saw the cartridges, a tremor ran through the 
                bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.</p>
              <p> 　　Each one received thirty cartridges.</p>
              <p> 　　Many had powder, and set about making others with the bullets 
                which they had run. As for the barrel of powder, it stood on a 
                table on one side, near the door, and was held in reserve.</p>
              <p> 　　The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, 
                but it had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise 
                to which they no longer paid any attention.</p>
              <p> 　　This noise retreated at times, and again drew near, with melancholy 
                undulations.</p>
              <p> 　　They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, 
                with solemn gravity.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades, 
                one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des Precheurs, 
                the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, 
                the guns loaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in 
                those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer, 
                surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which 
                no human movement palpitated, enveloped in the deepening shades 
                of twilight which was drawing on, in the midst of that silence 
                through which something could be felt advancing, and which had 
                about it something tragic and terrifying, isolated, armed, determined, 
                and tranquil.</p>
              <p></p>
            　　PREPARATIONS

              <p> 　　IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the 
                first floor and inquired for the commissary of police.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The commissary of police is not here,&quot; said a clerk; 
                &quot;but there is an inspector who takes his place.</p>
              <p> 　　Would you like to speak to him? Are you in haste?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The clerk introduced him into the commissary's office.</p>
              <p> 　　There stood a tall man behind a grating, leaning against a 
                stove, and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, 
                with three collars. His face was square, with a thin, firmmouth, 
                thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was 
                enough to turn your pockets inside out.</p>
              <p> 　　Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, 
                but that it searched.</p>
              <p> 　　This man's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible 
                than Jondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet 
                than the wolf.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What do you want?&quot; he said to Marius, without adding 
                &quot;monsieur.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is absent.</p>
              <p> 　　I am here in his stead.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The matter is very private.&quot;'</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then speak.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And great haste is required.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Then speak quick.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at 
                one and the same time.</p>
              <p> 　　He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure 
                to him:</p>
              <p> 　　That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than 
                by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, 
                as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, 
                a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition; that 
                the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that 
                there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, 
                among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; 
                that Jondrette's daughters were to lie in wait; that there was 
                no way of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know 
                his name; and that, finally, all this was to be carried out at 
                six o'clock that evening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard 
                de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52.</p>
              <p> 　　At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, 
                and said coldly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Precisely,&quot; answered Marius, and he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you acquainted with that house?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, 
                as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Apparently.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing 
                Marius so much as his cravat:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This word struck Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Patron-Minette,&quot; said he, &quot;I did hear that 
                word pronounced, in fact.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the 
                long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall 
                of the Rue du Petit-Banquier.</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector muttered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded 
                one Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As for Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. 
                Here, I've burned my coat.</p>
              <p> 　　They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves.</p>
              <p> 　　Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he glanced at Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And Panchaud.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about 
                the premises?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in 
                the Jardin des Plantes?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, 
                clerks, and employees.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not surprising that you did not see him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No. Who are all those persons?&quot; asked Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector answered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Besides, this is not the time for them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He relapsed into silence, then resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;50-52. I know that barrack.</p>
              <p> 　　Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists 
                seeing us, and then they will get off simply by countermanding 
                the vaudeville.</p>
              <p> 　　They are so modest! An audience embarrasses them.</p>
              <p> 　　None of that, none of that.</p>
              <p> 　　I want to hear them sing and make them dance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, 
                gazing at him intently the while:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you afraid?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of what?&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Of these men?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No more than yourself!&quot; retorted Marius rudely, 
                who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said 
                &quot;monsieur&quot; to him.</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued 
                with sententious solemnity:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest 
                man. Courage does not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius interrupted him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is well, but what do you intend to do?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector contented himself with the remark:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. 
                You must have one.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you it about you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Give it to me,&quot; said the inspector.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to 
                the inspector and added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you will take my advice, you will come in force.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might 
                have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a 
                rhyme to him; with one movement he plunged his hands, which were 
                enormous, into the two immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled 
                out two small steel pistols, of the sort called &quot;knock-me-downs.&quot; 
                Then he presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Take these.</p>
              <p> 　　Go home.</p>
              <p> 　　Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed to have 
                gone out.</p>
              <p> 　　They are loaded.</p>
              <p> 　　Each one carries two balls.</p>
              <p> 　　You will keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have 
                informed me.</p>
              <p> 　　These men will come.</p>
              <p> 　　Leave them to their own devices for a time.</p>
              <p> 　　When you think matters have reached a crisis, and that it 
                is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon.</p>
              <p> 　　The rest concerns me.</p>
              <p> 　　A shot into the ceiling, the air, no matter where.</p>
              <p> 　　Above all things, not too soon.</p>
              <p> 　　Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; 
                you are a lawyer; you know the proper point.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of 
                his coat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That makes a lump that can be seen,&quot; said the inspector. 
                &quot;Put them in your trousers pocket.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now,&quot; pursued the inspector, &quot;there is not 
                a minute more to be lost by any one.</p>
              <p> 　　What time is it?</p>
              <p> 　　Half-past two.</p>
              <p> 　　Seven o'clock is the hour?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Six o'clock,&quot; answered Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have plenty of time,&quot; said the inspector, &quot;but 
                no more than enough. Don't forget anything that I have said to 
                you.</p>
              <p> 　　Bang.</p>
              <p> 　　A pistol shot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rest easy,&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his 
                way out, the inspector called to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the way, if you have occasion for my services between 
                now and then, come or send here.</p>
              <p> 　　You will ask for Inspector Javert.&quot;</p>

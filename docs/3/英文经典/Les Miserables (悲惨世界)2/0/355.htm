              <p> 　　THE INSEPARABLE</p>
              <p> 　　 What had become of Jean Valjean?</p>
              <p> 　　Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette's graceful command, 
                when no one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen 
                and had gained the antechamber unperceived.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the very room which, eight months before, he had 
                entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringing back the 
                grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlanded 
                with foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa 
                on which they had laid Marius down.</p>
              <p> 　　Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white stockings and 
                white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes that 
                were to be served.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling, charged Basque 
                to explain his absence, and went away.</p>
              <p> 　　The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. 
                Jean Valjean stood for several minutes, erect and motionless in 
                the darkness, beneath those radiant windows.</p>
              <p> 　　He listened. The confused sounds of the banquet reached his 
                ear.</p>
              <p> 　　He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather, the 
                violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, and 
                through all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette's sweet 
                and joyous voice.</p>
              <p> 　　He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to 
                the Rue de l'Homme Arme.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the 
                Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was 
                a little longer, but it was the road through which, for the last 
                three months, he had become accustomed to pass every day on his 
                way from the Rue de l'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, 
                in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple.</p>
              <p> 　　This road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for 
                him all possibility of any other itinerary.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean entered his lodgings.</p>
              <p> 　　He lighted his candle and mounted the stairs.</p>
              <p> 　　The apartment was empty.</p>
              <p> 　　Even Toussaint was no longer there.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers.</p>
              <p> 　　All the cupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette's bedroom.</p>
              <p> 　　There were no sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with 
                ticking, and without a case or lace, was laid on the blankets 
                folded up on the foot of the mattress, whose covering was visible, 
                and on which no one was ever to sleep again. All the little feminine 
                objects which Cosette was attached to had been carried away; nothing 
                remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls.</p>
              <p> 　　Toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner. One bed only 
                was made up, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean 
                Valjean's bed.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard 
                doors, and went and came from one room to another.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle 
                on a table.</p>
              <p> 　　He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his 
                right hand as though it did not hurt him.</p>
              <p> 　　He approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? 
                was it intentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had 
                been jealous, on the little portmanteau which never left him. 
                On his arrival in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, 
                he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed. 
                He went to this table with a sort of vivacity, took a key from 
                his pocket, and opened the valise.</p>
              <p> 　　From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years 
                before, Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, 
                then the black fichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which 
                Cosette might almost have worn still, so tiny were her feet, then 
                the fustian bodice, which was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, 
                next the apron with pockets, then the woollen stockings. These 
                stockings, which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg, 
                were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand.</p>
              <p> 　　All this was black of hue. It was he who had brought those 
                garments to Montfermeil for her. As he removed them from the valise, 
                he laid them on the bed. He fell to thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　He called up memories.</p>
              <p> 　　It was in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was 
                shivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feet were all 
                red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandon 
                those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments.</p>
              <p> 　　The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to see her 
                daughter wearing mourning for her, and, above all, to see that 
                she was properly clothed, and that she was warm. He thought of 
                that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it together, Cosette 
                and he; he thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless 
                trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it 
                mattered not, it was charming.</p>
              <p> 　　He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next to 
                the petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at 
                them, one after the other. She was no taller than that, she had 
                her big doll in her arms, she had put her louis d'or in the pocket 
                of that apron, she had laughed, they walked hand in hand, she 
                had no one in the world but him.</p>
              <p> 　　Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that 
                stoical old heart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in 
                Cosette's garments, and if any one had passed up the stairs at 
                that moment, he would have heard frightful sobs.</p>

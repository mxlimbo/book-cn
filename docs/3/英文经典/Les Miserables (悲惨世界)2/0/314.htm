              <p> 　　 In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, 
                there is a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, 
                honor, enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, 
                and, above all, intermittences of hope.</p>
              <p> 　　One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of 
                hope suddenly traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
                at the moment when it was least expected.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Listen,&quot; suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still 
                on the watch, &quot;it seems to me that Paris is waking up.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the 
                insurrection broke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain 
                extent. The obstinacy of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated 
                some fancies.</p>
              <p> 　　Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des 
                Gravilliers.</p>
              <p> 　　In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with 
                a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, 
                on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground, shouldered 
                his weapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron, and turned 
                away, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's another who will do us no more harm.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was put to the sword.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the National Guard 
                from behind a lowered blind.</p>
              <p> 　　The slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot.</p>
              <p> 　　A child fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la 
                Cossonerie, with his pockets full of cartridges.</p>
              <p> 　　Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poiree, 
                a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment 
                of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac 
                de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of 
                pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; 
                a bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, 
                Napoleon's old lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's 
                saying at Saragossa: &quot;We are lost when the old women empty 
                their pots de chambre on our heads.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment 
                when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, 
                this fever of wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither 
                above those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs 
                of Paris,--all this, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. 
                They made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration.</p>
              <p> 　　They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie 
                and Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order 
                that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able 
                to finish them at one blow.</p>
              <p> 　　Columns were thrown into the streets where there was fermentation, 
                sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left, now slowly 
                and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the doors 
                of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time, manoeuvres 
                by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards.</p>
              <p> 　　This repression was not effected without some commotion, and 
                without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between 
                the army and the people.</p>
              <p> 　　This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the 
                cannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men 
                passing the end of the street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:--&quot;Those 
                wounded do not come from us.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. 
                In less than half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was 
                a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents 
                felt that sort of leaden cope, which the indifference of the people 
                casts over obstinate and deserted men, fall over them once more.</p>
              <p> 　　The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague 
                outline, had miscarried; and the attention of the minister of 
                war and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated 
                on the three or four barricades which still remained standing.</p>
              <p> 　　The sun was mounting above the horizon.</p>
              <p> 　　An insurgent hailed Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We are hungry here.</p>
              <p> 　　Are we really going to die like this, without anything to 
                eat?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, 
                made an affirmative sign with his head, but without taking his 
                eyes from the end of the street.</p>

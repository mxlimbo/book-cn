              <p> 　　THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES</p>
              <p> 　　 It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea.</p>
              <p> 　　As in the ocean, the diver may disappear there.</p>
              <p> 　　The transition was an unheard-of one.</p>
              <p> 　　In the very heart of the city, Jean Valjean had escaped from 
                the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye, in the time required 
                to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed from broad 
                daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, from 
                tumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation 
                of the tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than 
                that of the Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the 
                most absolute obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret 
                trap-door of Paris; to quit that street where death was on every 
                side, for that sort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange 
                instant.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening, 
                stupefied.</p>
              <p> 　　The waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him.</p>
              <p> 　　Celestial goodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery.</p>
              <p> 　　Adorable ambuscades of providence!</p>
              <p> 　　Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not 
                know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living 
                being or a dead corpse.</p>
              <p> 　　His first sensation was one of blindness.</p>
              <p> 　　All of a sudden, he could see nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become 
                deaf.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer heard anything.</p>
              <p> 　　The frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few 
                feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the thickness 
                of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said, otherwise 
                than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the depths. 
                He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all; 
                but that was enough.</p>
              <p> 　　He extended one arm and then the other, touched the walls 
                on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; he slipped, 
                and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously put 
                forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered 
                that the paving continued.</p>
              <p> 　　A gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he 
                stood.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind.</p>
              <p> 　　A little light fell through the man-hole through which he 
                had descended, and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to distinguish something. The passage in which he 
                had burrowed--no other word can better express the situation--was 
                walled in behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those blind alleys, which the special jargon 
                terms branches. In front of him there was another wall, a wall 
                like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten or twelve paces 
                from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast a wan 
                pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed 
                horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment.</p>
              <p> 　　A man could, however, plunge into that wall of fog and it 
                was necessary so to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Haste was even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that 
                the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones 
                might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything 
                hung upon this chance.</p>
              <p> 　　They also might descend into that well and search it.</p>
              <p> 　　There was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius 
                on the ground, he picked him up again,-- that is the real word 
                for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and set out.</p>
              <p> 　　He plunged resolutely into the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. 
                Perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, 
                perchance.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern 
                of miasmas and traps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had 
                fallen from one circle of hell into another.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt.</p>
              <p> 　　A problem presented itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage terminated in another gut which he encountered 
                across his path.</p>
              <p> 　　There two ways presented themselves. Which should he take?</p>
              <p> 　　Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he to 
                find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to 
                which we have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, 
                which is its slope.</p>
              <p> 　　To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.</p>
              <p> 　　This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; 
                that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the 
                slope, he would arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at 
                some mouth on the Seine between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, 
                that is to say, he would make his appearance in broad daylight 
                on the most densely peopled spot in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection 
                of streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men 
                emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a 
                call to arms of the neighboring post of guards.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus they would be seized before they had even got out. It 
                would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide themselves 
                to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for the outcome.</p>
              <p> 　　He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer 
                of an air-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon 
                him once more, and he became blind again.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former's 
                feet dragged behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He held both these arms with one hand, and groped along the 
                wall with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' cheek touched his, and clung there, bleeding. He felt 
                a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon him and 
                making its way under his clothes.</p>
              <p> 　　But a humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded 
                man touched, indicated respiration, and consequently, life.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage along which Jean Valjean was now proceeding was 
                not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean walked through it with 
                considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day had not, 
                as yet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the 
                centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall in order 
                not to have his feet in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he proceeded in the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　He resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible 
                and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes 
                emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether 
                his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision 
                returned to him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, 
                now of the wall which he touched, now of the vault beneath which 
                he was passing.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune 
                and ends by finding God there.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not easy to direct his course.</p>
              <p> 　　The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of 
                the streets which lie above it.</p>
              <p> 　　There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy 
                branches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing 
                at that epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of 
                eleven leagues.</p>
              <p> 　　We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the 
                special activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty 
                leagues in extent.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that he was beneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it 
                was a pity that it was not so. Under the Rue Saint-Denis there 
                is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII.</p>
              <p> 　　and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the 
                Grand Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation 
                of the ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin 
                sewer, whose four arms describe a cross.</p>
              <p> 　　But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance to which 
                was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicated 
                with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre 
                sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was entangled.</p>
              <p> 　　There opportunities of losing oneself abound.</p>
              <p> 　　The Montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the 
                ancient network.</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of 
                the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of 
                a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but 
                he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more 
                than one street corner--for they are streets-- presenting itself 
                in the gloom like an interrogation point; first, on his left, 
                the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting 
                out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office 
                and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far as the Seine, 
                where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the curving 
                corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are 
                also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the Mail, 
                complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, and 
                proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand 
                crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every 
                direction; and lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue 
                des Jeuneurs, without counting little ducts here and there, before 
                reaching the belt sewer, which alone could conduct him to some 
                issue sufficiently distant to be safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed 
                out, he would speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, 
                that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. 
                Instead of the ancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, 
                haughty and royal even in the sewer, with pavement and string 
                courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the 
                fathom, he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness, 
                economical expedients, porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete 
                foundation, which costs two hundred francs the metre, and the 
                bourgeoise masonry known as a petits materiaux--small stuff; but 
                of all this he knew nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, 
                knowing nothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in 
                providence.</p>
              <p> 　　By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. 
                The gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked in an enigma.</p>
              <p> 　　This aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in 
                a dizzy fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route 
                without seeing it.</p>
              <p> 　　In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last.</p>
              <p> 　　How was he to get out? should he find an issue? should he 
                find it in time? would that colossal subterranean sponge with 
                its stone cavities, allow itself to be penetrated and pierced? 
                should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness? 
                should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable? would 
                Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger? should they end 
                by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook 
                of that night?</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know. He put all these questions to himself without 
                replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he had a surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　At the most unforeseen moment, and without having ceased to 
                walk in a straight line, he perceived that he was no longer ascending; 
                the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels, instead 
                of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now descending.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine?</p>
              <p> 　　This danger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was 
                still greater.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding.</p>
              <p> 　　The ridge which the soil of Paris forms on its right bank 
                empties one of its water-sheds into the Seine and the other into 
                the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge which determines the 
                division of the waters describes a very capricious line.</p>
              <p> 　　The culminating point, which is the point of separation of 
                the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte, 
                in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre 
                sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean 
                Valjean had reached.</p>
              <p> 　　He was directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was 
                on the right path. But he did not know it.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, 
                and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller 
                than the passage in which he was, he did not enter but continued 
                his route, rightly judging that every narrower way must needs 
                terminate in a blind alley, and could only lead him further from 
                his goal, that is to say, the outlet.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in 
                the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from 
                beneath the Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the 
                barricades had suppressed circulation, and that he was entering 
                beneath the living and normal Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant 
                but continuous.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the rumbling of vehicles.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according 
                to the calculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not 
                yet thought of rest; he had merely changed the hand with which 
                he was holding Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth 
                reassured him.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was outlined on a faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, 
                which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot, and the 
                vault overhead, and gilded to his right and to his left the two 
                viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied, he turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just 
                passed through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing 
                the dense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had 
                the air of surveying him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the 
                sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about 
                in a confused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.</p>
            　　THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES
              <p> 　　 It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea.</p>
              <p> 　　As in the ocean, the diver may disappear there.</p>
              <p> 　　The transition was an unheard-of one.</p>
              <p> 　　In the very heart of the city, Jean Valjean had escaped from 
                the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye, in the time required 
                to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed from broad 
                daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, from 
                tumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation 
                of the tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than 
                that of the Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the 
                most absolute obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret 
                trap-door of Paris; to quit that street where death was on every 
                side, for that sort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange 
                instant.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening, 
                stupefied.</p>
              <p> 　　The waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him.</p>
              <p> 　　Celestial goodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery.</p>
              <p> 　　Adorable ambuscades of providence!</p>
              <p> 　　Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not 
                know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living 
                being or a dead corpse.</p>
              <p> 　　His first sensation was one of blindness.</p>
              <p> 　　All of a sudden, he could see nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become 
                deaf.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer heard anything.</p>
              <p> 　　The frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few 
                feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the thickness 
                of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said, otherwise 
                than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the depths. 
                He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all; 
                but that was enough.</p>
              <p> 　　He extended one arm and then the other, touched the walls 
                on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; he slipped, 
                and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously put 
                forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered 
                that the paving continued.</p>
              <p> 　　A gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he 
                stood.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind.</p>
              <p> 　　A little light fell through the man-hole through which he 
                had descended, and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to distinguish something. The passage in which he 
                had burrowed--no other word can better express the situation--was 
                walled in behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those blind alleys, which the special jargon 
                terms branches. In front of him there was another wall, a wall 
                like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten or twelve paces 
                from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast a wan 
                pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed 
                horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment.</p>
              <p> 　　A man could, however, plunge into that wall of fog and it 
                was necessary so to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Haste was even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that 
                the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones 
                might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything 
                hung upon this chance.</p>
              <p> 　　They also might descend into that well and search it.</p>
              <p> 　　There was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius 
                on the ground, he picked him up again,-- that is the real word 
                for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and set out.</p>
              <p> 　　He plunged resolutely into the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. 
                Perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, 
                perchance.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern 
                of miasmas and traps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had 
                fallen from one circle of hell into another.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt.</p>
              <p> 　　A problem presented itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage terminated in another gut which he encountered 
                across his path.</p>
              <p> 　　There two ways presented themselves. Which should he take?</p>
              <p> 　　Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he to 
                find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to 
                which we have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, 
                which is its slope.</p>
              <p> 　　To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.</p>
              <p> 　　This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; 
                that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the 
                slope, he would arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at 
                some mouth on the Seine between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, 
                that is to say, he would make his appearance in broad daylight 
                on the most densely peopled spot in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection 
                of streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men 
                emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a 
                call to arms of the neighboring post of guards.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus they would be seized before they had even got out. It 
                would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide themselves 
                to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for the outcome.</p>
              <p> 　　He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer 
                of an air-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon 
                him once more, and he became blind again.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former's 
                feet dragged behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He held both these arms with one hand, and groped along the 
                wall with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' cheek touched his, and clung there, bleeding. He felt 
                a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon him and 
                making its way under his clothes.</p>
              <p> 　　But a humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded 
                man touched, indicated respiration, and consequently, life.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage along which Jean Valjean was now proceeding was 
                not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean walked through it with 
                considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day had not, 
                as yet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the 
                centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall in order 
                not to have his feet in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he proceeded in the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　He resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible 
                and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes 
                emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether 
                his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision 
                returned to him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, 
                now of the wall which he touched, now of the vault beneath which 
                he was passing.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune 
                and ends by finding God there.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not easy to direct his course.</p>
              <p> 　　The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of 
                the streets which lie above it.</p>
              <p> 　　There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy 
                branches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing 
                at that epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of 
                eleven leagues.</p>
              <p> 　　We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the 
                special activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty 
                leagues in extent.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that he was beneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it 
                was a pity that it was not so. Under the Rue Saint-Denis there 
                is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII.</p>
              <p> 　　and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the 
                Grand Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation 
                of the ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin 
                sewer, whose four arms describe a cross.</p>
              <p> 　　But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance to which 
                was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicated 
                with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre 
                sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was entangled.</p>
              <p> 　　There opportunities of losing oneself abound.</p>
              <p> 　　The Montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the 
                ancient network.</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of 
                the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of 
                a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but 
                he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more 
                than one street corner--for they are streets-- presenting itself 
                in the gloom like an interrogation point; first, on his left, 
                the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting 
                out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office 
                and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far as the Seine, 
                where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the curving 
                corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are 
                also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the Mail, 
                complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, and 
                proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand 
                crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every 
                direction; and lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue 
                des Jeuneurs, without counting little ducts here and there, before 
                reaching the belt sewer, which alone could conduct him to some 
                issue sufficiently distant to be safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed 
                out, he would speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, 
                that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. 
                Instead of the ancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, 
                haughty and royal even in the sewer, with pavement and string 
                courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the 
                fathom, he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness, 
                economical expedients, porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete 
                foundation, which costs two hundred francs the metre, and the 
                bourgeoise masonry known as a petits materiaux--small stuff; but 
                of all this he knew nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, 
                knowing nothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in 
                providence.</p>
              <p> 　　By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. 
                The gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked in an enigma.</p>
              <p> 　　This aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in 
                a dizzy fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route 
                without seeing it.</p>
              <p> 　　In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last.</p>
              <p> 　　How was he to get out? should he find an issue? should he 
                find it in time? would that colossal subterranean sponge with 
                its stone cavities, allow itself to be penetrated and pierced? 
                should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness? 
                should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable? would 
                Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger? should they end 
                by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook 
                of that night?</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know. He put all these questions to himself without 
                replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he had a surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　At the most unforeseen moment, and without having ceased to 
                walk in a straight line, he perceived that he was no longer ascending; 
                the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels, instead 
                of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now descending.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine?</p>
              <p> 　　This danger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was 
                still greater.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding.</p>
              <p> 　　The ridge which the soil of Paris forms on its right bank 
                empties one of its water-sheds into the Seine and the other into 
                the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge which determines the 
                division of the waters describes a very capricious line.</p>
              <p> 　　The culminating point, which is the point of separation of 
                the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte, 
                in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre 
                sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean 
                Valjean had reached.</p>
              <p> 　　He was directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was 
                on the right path. But he did not know it.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, 
                and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller 
                than the passage in which he was, he did not enter but continued 
                his route, rightly judging that every narrower way must needs 
                terminate in a blind alley, and could only lead him further from 
                his goal, that is to say, the outlet.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in 
                the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from 
                beneath the Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the 
                barricades had suppressed circulation, and that he was entering 
                beneath the living and normal Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant 
                but continuous.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the rumbling of vehicles.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according 
                to the calculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not 
                yet thought of rest; he had merely changed the hand with which 
                he was holding Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth 
                reassured him.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was outlined on a faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, 
                which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot, and the 
                vault overhead, and gilded to his right and to his left the two 
                viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied, he turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just 
                passed through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing 
                the dense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had 
                the air of surveying him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the 
                sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about 
                in a confused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.</p>
            　　THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES
              <p> 　　 It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.</p>
              <p> 　　Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea.</p>
              <p> 　　As in the ocean, the diver may disappear there.</p>
              <p> 　　The transition was an unheard-of one.</p>
              <p> 　　In the very heart of the city, Jean Valjean had escaped from 
                the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye, in the time required 
                to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed from broad 
                daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, from 
                tumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation 
                of the tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than 
                that of the Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the 
                most absolute obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret 
                trap-door of Paris; to quit that street where death was on every 
                side, for that sort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange 
                instant.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening, 
                stupefied.</p>
              <p> 　　The waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him.</p>
              <p> 　　Celestial goodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery.</p>
              <p> 　　Adorable ambuscades of providence!</p>
              <p> 　　Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not 
                know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living 
                being or a dead corpse.</p>
              <p> 　　His first sensation was one of blindness.</p>
              <p> 　　All of a sudden, he could see nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become 
                deaf.</p>
              <p> 　　He no longer heard anything.</p>
              <p> 　　The frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few 
                feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the thickness 
                of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said, otherwise 
                than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the depths. 
                He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all; 
                but that was enough.</p>
              <p> 　　He extended one arm and then the other, touched the walls 
                on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; he slipped, 
                and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously put 
                forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered 
                that the paving continued.</p>
              <p> 　　A gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he 
                stood.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind.</p>
              <p> 　　A little light fell through the man-hole through which he 
                had descended, and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to distinguish something. The passage in which he 
                had burrowed--no other word can better express the situation--was 
                walled in behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was one of those blind alleys, which the special jargon 
                terms branches. In front of him there was another wall, a wall 
                like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten or twelve paces 
                from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast a wan 
                pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed 
                horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment.</p>
              <p> 　　A man could, however, plunge into that wall of fog and it 
                was necessary so to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Haste was even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that 
                the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones 
                might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything 
                hung upon this chance.</p>
              <p> 　　They also might descend into that well and search it.</p>
              <p> 　　There was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius 
                on the ground, he picked him up again,-- that is the real word 
                for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and set out.</p>
              <p> 　　He plunged resolutely into the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. 
                Perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, 
                perchance.</p>
              <p> 　　After the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern 
                of miasmas and traps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had 
                fallen from one circle of hell into another.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt.</p>
              <p> 　　A problem presented itself.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage terminated in another gut which he encountered 
                across his path.</p>
              <p> 　　There two ways presented themselves. Which should he take?</p>
              <p> 　　Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he to 
                find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to 
                which we have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, 
                which is its slope.</p>
              <p> 　　To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.</p>
              <p> 　　This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; 
                that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the 
                slope, he would arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at 
                some mouth on the Seine between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, 
                that is to say, he would make his appearance in broad daylight 
                on the most densely peopled spot in Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection 
                of streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men 
                emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a 
                call to arms of the neighboring post of guards.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus they would be seized before they had even got out. It 
                would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide themselves 
                to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for the outcome.</p>
              <p> 　　He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.</p>
              <p> 　　When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer 
                of an air-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon 
                him once more, and he became blind again.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former's 
                feet dragged behind him.</p>
              <p> 　　He held both these arms with one hand, and groped along the 
                wall with the other.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' cheek touched his, and clung there, bleeding. He felt 
                a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon him and 
                making its way under his clothes.</p>
              <p> 　　But a humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded 
                man touched, indicated respiration, and consequently, life.</p>
              <p> 　　The passage along which Jean Valjean was now proceeding was 
                not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean walked through it with 
                considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day had not, 
                as yet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the 
                centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall in order 
                not to have his feet in the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he proceeded in the gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　He resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible 
                and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes 
                emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether 
                his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision 
                returned to him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, 
                now of the wall which he touched, now of the vault beneath which 
                he was passing.</p>
              <p> 　　The pupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune 
                and ends by finding God there.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not easy to direct his course.</p>
              <p> 　　The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of 
                the streets which lie above it.</p>
              <p> 　　There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred streets.</p>
              <p> 　　Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy 
                branches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing 
                at that epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of 
                eleven leagues.</p>
              <p> 　　We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the 
                special activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty 
                leagues in extent.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that he was beneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it 
                was a pity that it was not so. Under the Rue Saint-Denis there 
                is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII.</p>
              <p> 　　and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the 
                Grand Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation 
                of the ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin 
                sewer, whose four arms describe a cross.</p>
              <p> 　　But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance to which 
                was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicated 
                with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre 
                sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was entangled.</p>
              <p> 　　There opportunities of losing oneself abound.</p>
              <p> 　　The Montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the 
                ancient network.</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of 
                the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of 
                a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but 
                he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more 
                than one street corner--for they are streets-- presenting itself 
                in the gloom like an interrogation point; first, on his left, 
                the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting 
                out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office 
                and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far as the Seine, 
                where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the curving 
                corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are 
                also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the Mail, 
                complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, and 
                proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand 
                crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every 
                direction; and lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue 
                des Jeuneurs, without counting little ducts here and there, before 
                reaching the belt sewer, which alone could conduct him to some 
                issue sufficiently distant to be safe.</p>
              <p> 　　Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed 
                out, he would speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, 
                that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. 
                Instead of the ancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, 
                haughty and royal even in the sewer, with pavement and string 
                courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the 
                fathom, he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness, 
                economical expedients, porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete 
                foundation, which costs two hundred francs the metre, and the 
                bourgeoise masonry known as a petits materiaux--small stuff; but 
                of all this he knew nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, 
                knowing nothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in 
                providence.</p>
              <p> 　　By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. 
                The gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked in an enigma.</p>
              <p> 　　This aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in 
                a dizzy fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route 
                without seeing it.</p>
              <p> 　　In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last.</p>
              <p> 　　How was he to get out? should he find an issue? should he 
                find it in time? would that colossal subterranean sponge with 
                its stone cavities, allow itself to be penetrated and pierced? 
                should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness? 
                should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable? would 
                Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger? should they end 
                by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook 
                of that night?</p>
              <p> 　　He did not know. He put all these questions to himself without 
                replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he had a surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　At the most unforeseen moment, and without having ceased to 
                walk in a straight line, he perceived that he was no longer ascending; 
                the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels, instead 
                of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now descending.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine?</p>
              <p> 　　This danger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was 
                still greater.</p>
              <p> 　　He continued to advance.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding.</p>
              <p> 　　The ridge which the soil of Paris forms on its right bank 
                empties one of its water-sheds into the Seine and the other into 
                the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge which determines the 
                division of the waters describes a very capricious line.</p>
              <p> 　　The culminating point, which is the point of separation of 
                the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte, 
                in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre 
                sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean 
                Valjean had reached.</p>
              <p> 　　He was directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was 
                on the right path. But he did not know it.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, 
                and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller 
                than the passage in which he was, he did not enter but continued 
                his route, rightly judging that every narrower way must needs 
                terminate in a blind alley, and could only lead him further from 
                his goal, that is to say, the outlet.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in 
                the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.</p>
              <p> 　　At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from 
                beneath the Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the 
                barricades had suppressed circulation, and that he was entering 
                beneath the living and normal Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant 
                but continuous.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the rumbling of vehicles.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according 
                to the calculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not 
                yet thought of rest; he had merely changed the hand with which 
                he was holding Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth 
                reassured him.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was outlined on a faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, 
                which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot, and the 
                vault overhead, and gilded to his right and to his left the two 
                viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied, he turned round.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just 
                passed through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing 
                the dense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had 
                the air of surveying him.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the 
                sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about 
                in a confused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.</p>

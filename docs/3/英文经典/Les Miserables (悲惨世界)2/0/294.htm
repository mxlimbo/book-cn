              <p> 　　GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS' CARBINE</p>
              <p> 　　 They threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup's over Father 
                Mabeuf. Six men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid 
                the body, and bore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, 
                to the large table in the tap-room.</p>
              <p> 　　These men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in 
                which they were engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation 
                in which they stood.</p>
              <p> 　　When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, 
                Enjolras said to the spy:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It will be your turn presently!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　During all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had not quitted 
                his post, but had remained on guard, thought he espied some men 
                stealthily approaching the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once he shouted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look out!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel, 
                Bossuet, and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. 
                It was almost too late.</p>
              <p> 　　They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above 
                the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in, 
                some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut, thrusting 
                before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.</p>
              <p> 　　The moment was critical.</p>
              <p> 　　It was that first, redoubtable moment of inundation, when 
                the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water 
                begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more and 
                the barricade would have been taken.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, 
                and killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second 
                killed Bahorel with a blow from his bayonet.</p>
              <p> 　　Another had already overthrown Courfeyrac, who was shouting:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Follow me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The largest of all, a sort of colossus, marched on Gavroche 
                with his bayonet fixed. The urchin took in his arms Javert's immense 
                gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, and fired.</p>
              <p> 　　No discharge followed. Javert's gun was not loaded.</p>
              <p> 　　The municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet 
                at the child.</p>
              <p> 　　Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from 
                the soldier's grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman 
                in the centre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A 
                second bullet struck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac 
                in the breast, and laid him low on the pavement.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.</p>

              <p> 　　FUTURE PROGRESS</p>
              <p> 　　 The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. 
                The last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to 
                bring it to a termination, any more than they have been able to 
                finish Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the 
                growth of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Within the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious 
                polyp with a thousand antennae, which expands below as the city 
                expands above.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches 
                out an arm.</p>
              <p> 　　The old monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand 
                three hundred metres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in 
                this respect on the first of January, 1806. Beginning with this 
                epoch, of which we shall shortly speak, the work was usefully 
                and energetically resumed and prosecuted; Napoleon built--the 
                figures are curious--four thousand eight hundred and four metres; 
                Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred and nine; Charles X., 
                ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-six; Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine 
                thousand and twenty; the Republic of 1848, twenty-three thousand 
                three hundred and eighty-one; the present government, seventy 
                thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time, two hundred 
                and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres; sixty leagues 
                of sewers; the enormous entrails of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　An obscure ramification ever at work; a construction which 
                is immense and ignored.</p>
              <p> 　　As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is 
                to-day more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the 
                century. It is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance 
                and the efforts which have been required to bring this cess-pool 
                to the point of relative perfection in which it now is.</p>
              <p> 　　It was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical 
                provostship and, during the last ten years of the eighteenth century, 
                the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded in perforating the 
                five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806.</p>
              <p> 　　All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar 
                to the soil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious 
                population of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious 
                to the pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation.</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate 
                than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous 
                historical formation called Paris; as soon as work in any form 
                whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium, 
                subterranean resistances abound. There are liquid clays, springs, 
                hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmires which special science 
                calls moutardes.[59] The pick advances laboriously through the 
                calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of clay, 
                and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the 
                contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through a vault that has 
                been begun, and inundates the laborers; or a layer of marl is 
                laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a cataract, breaking 
                the stoutest supporting beams like glass.</p>
              <p> 　　Quite recently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass 
                the collecting sewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting 
                navigation or emptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin 
                of the canal, water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean 
                tunnel, which was beyond the power of the pumping engines; it 
                was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had 
                been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin, and it was 
                not without great difficulty that it was stopped up.</p>
              <p> 　　Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distance 
                from the river, as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and 
                Lumiere Passage, quicksands are encountered in which one sticks 
                fast, and in which a man sinks visibly.</p>
              <p> 　　Add suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides, and sudden crumbling 
                of the earth. Add the typhus, with which the workmen become slowly 
                impregnated. In our own day, after having excavated the gallery 
                of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the principal water-conduit 
                of Ourcq, a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres 
                deep; after having, in the midst of land-slides, and with the 
                aid of excavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted the 
                Bievre from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as the Seine; after 
                having, in order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre 
                and in order to provide an outlet for that river-like pool nine 
                hectares in extent, which crouched near the Barriere des Martyrs, 
                after having, let us state, constructed the line of sewers from 
                the Barriere Blanche to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, 
                working day and night, at a depth of eleven metres; after having--a 
                thing heretofore unseen-- made a subterranean sewer in the Rue 
                Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six metres below the surface, 
                the superintendent, Monnot, died. After having vaulted three thousand 
                metres of sewer in all quarters of the city, from the Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine 
                to the Rue de l'Ourcine, after having freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard 
                from inundations of rain by means of the branch of the Arbalete, 
                after having built the Saint-Georges sewer, on rock and concrete 
                in the fluid sands, after having directed the formidable lowering 
                of the flooring of the vault timber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth 
                branch, Duleau the engineer died.</p>
              <p> 　　There are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these, 
                which are more useful, nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter 
                of the field of battle.</p>
              <p> 　　 [59] Mustards.</p>
              <p> 　　 The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they 
                are to-day. Bruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was 
                required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place 
                later on.</p>
              <p> 　　It is surprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part 
                of the belt sewer, called the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still 
                stood stagnating uncovered to the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. 
                It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found in its pocket 
                the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and six centimes 
                required for covering this mass of filth.</p>
              <p> 　　The three absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and 
                Saint-Mande, with their discharging mouths, their apparatus, their 
                cesspools, and their depuratory branches, only date from 1836.</p>
              <p> 　　The intestinal sewer of Paris has been made over anew, and, 
                as we have said, it has been extended more than tenfold within 
                the last quarter of a century.</p>
              <p> 　　Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 
                5th and 6th of June, it was still, in many localities, nearly 
                the same ancient sewer. A very great number of streets which are 
                now convex were then sunken causeways.</p>
              <p> 　　At the end of a slope, where the tributaries of a street or 
                cross-roads ended, there were often to be seen large, square gratings 
                with heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps of the 
                throng, gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles, and caused 
                horses to fall.</p>
              <p> 　　The official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these 
                gratings the expressive name of Cassis.[60]</p>
              <p> 　　 [60] From casser, to break:</p>
              <p> 　　break-necks.</p>
              <p> 　　 In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l'Etoile, 
                the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vielle-duTemple, 
                the Rue Notre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Mericourt, the Quai 
                aux Fleurs, the Rue du Petit-Muse, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue 
                Pont-Aux-Biches, the Rue des Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, 
                the Rue Notre Dame des-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the 
                Rue Grange-Bateliere, in the Champs-Elysees, the Rue Jacob, the 
                Rue de Tournon, the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed 
                its maw. It consisted of enormous voids of stone catch-basins 
                sometimes surrounded by stone posts, with monumental effrontery.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically 
                as stated in 1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms.</p>
              <p> 　　After Bruneseau, on the 1st of January, 1832, it had forty 
                thousand three hundred metres. Between 1806 and 1831, there had 
                been built, on an average, seven hundred and fifty metres annually, 
                afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries were 
                constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, with hydraulic 
                mortar which hardens under water, on a cement foundation.</p>
              <p> 　　At two hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris' 
                sewers of the present day represent forty-eight millions.</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated 
                at the beginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected 
                with that immense question:</p>
              <p> 　　the sewers of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a 
                sheet of air. The sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth 
                underground, but already sounded by two bores, is furnished by 
                the layer of green clay situated between the chalk and the Jurassic 
                lime-stone; this layer may be represented by a disk five and twenty 
                leagues in circumference; a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze 
                there; one drinks the Seine, the Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the 
                Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the Loire in a glass of water 
                from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water is healthy, it comes 
                from heaven in the first place and next from the earth; the sheet 
                of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　All the miasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath 
                of the city; hence this bad breath.</p>
              <p> 　　The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been scientifically 
                proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　In a given time, with the aid of progress, mechanisms become 
                perfected, and as light increases, the sheet of water will be 
                employed to purify the sheet of air; that is to say, to wash the 
                sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　The reader knows, that by &quot;washing the sewer&quot; we 
                mean:</p>
              <p> 　　the restitution of the filth to the earth; the return to the 
                soil of dung and of manure to the fields. Through this simple 
                act, the entire social community will experience a diminution 
                of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour, 
                the radiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues 
                around the Louvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.</p>
              <p> 　　We might say that, for ten centuries, the cess-pool has been 
                the disease of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. The 
                popular instinct has never been deceived in it.</p>
              <p> 　　The occupation of sewermen was formerly almost as perilous, 
                and almost as repugnant to the people, as the occupation of knacker, 
                which was so long held in horror and handed over to the executioner.</p>
              <p> 　　High wages were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in 
                that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-pool cleaner hesitated 
                to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;&quot; 
                and all sorts of hideous legends, as we have said, covered this 
                colossal sink with terror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces 
                of the revolutions of the globe as of the revolutions of man, 
                and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms from the 
                shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat.</p>

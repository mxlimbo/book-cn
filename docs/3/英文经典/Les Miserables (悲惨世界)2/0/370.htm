              <p> 　　THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACES</p>
              <p> 　　In the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common 
                grave, far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, 
                far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence 
                of eternity all the hideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, 
                beside an old wall, beneath a great yew tree over which climbs 
                the wild convolvulus, amid dandelions and mosses, there lies a 
                stone.</p>
              <p> 　　That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy 
                of time, of dampness, of the lichens and from the defilement of 
                the birds.</p>
              <p> 　　The water turns it green, the air blackens it.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not near any path, and people are not fond of walking 
                in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet are 
                immediately wet.</p>
              <p> 　　When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come thither.</p>
              <p> 　　All around there is a quivering of weeds.</p>
              <p> 　　In the spring, linnets warble in the trees.</p>
              <p> 　　This stone is perfectly plain.</p>
              <p> 　　In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the 
                tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the stone long 
                enough and narrow enough to cover a man.</p>
              <p> 　　No name is to be read there.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these 
                four lines, which have become gradually illegible beneath the 
                rain and the dust, and which are, to-day, probably effaced: </p>
              <p> 　　　　 Il dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange, </p>
              <p> 　　　　Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange. </p>
              <p> 　　　　La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva, </p>
              <p> 　　　　Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.[70]</p>
              <p> 　　[70] He sleeps.</p>
              <p> 　　Although his fate was very strange, he lived.</p>
              <p> 　　He died when he had no longer his angel.</p>
              <p> 　　The thing came to pass simply, of itself, as the night comes 
                when day is gone. </p>
              <p> 　　LETTER TO M. DAELLI</p>
              <p> 　　Publisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in 
                Milan. </p>
              <p> 　　HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862.<br>
                <br>
                　　You are right, sir, when you tell me that Les Miserables is 
                written for all nations.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not know whether it will be read by all, but I wrote 
                it for all.</p>
              <p> 　　It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to Italy as 
                well as to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to Republics 
                which have slaves as well as to Empires which have serfs.</p>
              <p> 　　Social problems overstep frontiers.</p>
              <p> 　　The sores of the human race, those great sores which cover 
                the globe, do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the 
                map.</p>
              <p> 　　In every place where man is ignorant and despairing, in every 
                place where woman is sold for bread, wherever the child suffers 
                for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth 
                which should warm him, the book of Les Miserables knocks at the 
                door and says:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Open to me, I come for you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, 
                and which is still so sombre, the miserable's name is Man; he 
                is agonizing in all climes, and he is groaning in all languages.</p>
              <p> 　　Your Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France.</p>
              <p> 　　Your admirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Does not banditism, that raging form of pauperism, inhabit 
                your mountains?</p>
              <p> 　　Few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents 
                which I have endeavored to fathom.</p>
              <p> 　　In spite of your possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo, 
                Turin, Florence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, 
                Venice, a heroic history, sublime ruins, magnificent ruins, and 
                superb cities, you are, like ourselves, poor.</p>
              <p> 　　You are covered with marvels and vermin.</p>
              <p> 　　Assuredly, the sun of Italy is splendid, but, alas, azure 
                in the sky does not prevent rags on man.</p>
              <p> 　　Like us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms, 
                blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs.</p>
              <p> 　　You taste nothing of the present nor of the future without 
                a flavor of the past being mingled with it.</p>
              <p> 　　You have a barbarian, the monk, and a savage, the lazzarone.</p>
              <p> 　　The social question is the same for you as for us.</p>
              <p> 　　There are a few less deaths from hunger with you, and a few 
                more from fever; your social hygiene is not much better than ours; 
                shadows, which are Protestant in England, are Catholic in Italy; 
                but, under different names, the vescovo is identical with the 
                bishop, and it always means night, and of pretty nearly the same 
                quality.</p>
              <p> 　　To explain the Bible badly amounts to the same thing as to 
                understand the Gospel badly.</p>
              <p> 　　Is it necessary to emphasize this?</p>
              <p> 　　Must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified?</p>
              <p> 　　Have you not indigent persons?</p>
              <p> 　　Glance below.</p>
              <p> 　　Have you not parasites?</p>
              <p> 　　Glance up.</p>
              <p> 　　Does not that hideous balance, whose two scales, pauperism 
                and parasitism, so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium, 
                oscillate before you as it does before us?</p>
              <p> 　　Where is your army of schoolmasters, the only army which civilization 
                acknowledges?</p>
              <p> 　　Where are your free and compulsory schools?</p>
              <p> 　　Does every one know how to read in the land of Dante and of 
                Michael Angelo?</p>
              <p> 　　Have you made public schools of your barracks?</p>
              <p> 　　Have you not, like ourselves, an opulent war-budget and a 
                paltry budget of education?</p>
              <p> 　　Have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily 
                converted into soldierly obedience? military establishment which 
                pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing upon Garibaldi; 
                that is to say, upon the living honor of Italy?</p>
              <p> 　　Let us subject your social order to examination, let us take 
                it where it stands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant 
                offences, show me the woman and the child.</p>
              <p> 　　It is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble 
                creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to 
                be measured.</p>
              <p> 　　Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than in Paris?</p>
              <p> 　　What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and 
                what amount of justice springs from your tribunals?</p>
              <p> 　　Do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the 
                meaning of those gloomy words:</p>
              <p> 　　public prosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the 
                executioner, the death penalty?</p>
              <p> 　　Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead and Farinace 
                is alive.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons.</p>
              <p> 　　Have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality 
                and politics?</p>
              <p> 　　You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes!</p>
              <p> 　　Something very similar has been done in France.</p>
              <p> 　　Stay, let us pass miseries in review, let each one contribute 
                his pile, you are as rich as we.</p>
              <p> 　　Have you not, like ourselves, two condemnations, religious 
                condemnation pronounced by the priest, and social condemnation 
                decreed by the judge?</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, great nation of Italy, thou resemblest the great nation 
                of France!</p>
              <p> 　　Alas! our brothers, you are, like ourselves, Miserables.</p>
              <p> 　　From the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do not 
                see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals 
                of Eden.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, the priests are mistaken.</p>
              <p> 　　These holy portals are before and not behind us.</p>
              <p> 　　I resume.</p>
              <p> 　　This book, Les Miserables, is no less your mirror than ours.</p>
              <p> 　　Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,-- 
                I understand that.</p>
              <p> 　　Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; that does 
                not prevent them from being of use.</p>
              <p> 　　As for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love 
                for my own country, but without being engrossed by France more 
                than by any other nation.</p>
              <p> 　　In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and 
                I become more and more patriotic for humanity.</p>
              <p> 　　This is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of 
                radiance of the French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively 
                French, Italian, German, Spanish, or English, and become European, 
                I say more, human, if they are to correspond to the enlargement 
                of civilization.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence a new logic of art, and of certain requirements of composition 
                which modify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, 
                of taste and language, which must grow broader like all the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　In France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great 
                delight, with having transgressed the bounds of what they call 
                &quot;French taste&quot;; I should be glad if this eulogium were 
                merited.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same universal 
                suffering, and I try to assuage it, I possess only the puny forces 
                of a man, and I cry to all:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Help me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it 
                for you and for your country.</p>
              <p> 　　If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of one phrase 
                in your letter.</p>
              <p> 　　You write:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say:</p>
              <p> 　　`This book, Les Miserables, is a French book.</p>
              <p> 　　It does not concern us.</p>
              <p> 　　Let the French read it as a history, we read it as a romance.'&quot;--Alas!</p>
              <p> 　　I repeat, whether we be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns 
                us all.</p>
              <p> 　　Ever since history has been written, ever since philosophy 
                has meditated, misery has been the garment of the human race; 
                the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag, and 
                for replacing, upon the naked limbs of the Man-People, the sinister 
                fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn.</p>
              <p> 　　If this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some 
                minds and in dissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty to 
                publish it, sir.</p>
              <p>Accept, I pray you, a renewed assurance of my very distinguished 
                sentiments. </p>

              <p> 　　M. MABEUF</p>
              <p> 　　 On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly I approve of political opinions,&quot; he 
                expressed the real state of his mind. All political opinions were 
                matters of indifference to him, and he approved them all, without 
                distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the Greeks called 
                the Furies &quot;the beautiful, the good, the charming,&quot; 
                the Eumenides.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted in a passionate love 
                for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the 
                world, he possessed the termination in ist, without which no one 
                could exist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, 
                a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, 
                a collector of old books.</p>
              <p> 　　He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating 
                each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy, 
                legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the 
                world all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might 
                be looking at, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they 
                might turn over.</p>
              <p> 　　He took good care not to become useless; having books did 
                not prevent his reading, being a botanist did not prevent his 
                being a gardener.</p>
              <p> 　　When he made Pontmercy's acquaintance, this sympathy had existed 
                between the colonel and himself--that what the colonel did for 
                flowers, he did for fruits.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory 
                as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations, 
                apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no 
                less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin.</p>
              <p> 　　He went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and 
                because, as he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, 
                he found them assembled and silent only in church. Feeling that 
                he must be something in the State, he had chosen the career of 
                warden.</p>
              <p> 　　However, he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much 
                as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir. He had long 
                passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: &quot;Have you 
                never been married?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I have forgotten,&quot; said he. When it sometimes happened 
                to him--and to whom does it not happen?-- to say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Oh! if I were only rich!&quot; it was not when ogling 
                a pretty girl, as was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when 
                contemplating an old book.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, 
                and when he was asleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, 
                lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets. He had composed and 
                published a Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz, with colored plates, 
                a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold 
                well.</p>
              <p> 　　People rang his bell, in the Rue Mesieres, two or three times 
                a day, to ask for it.</p>
              <p> 　　He drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it; this 
                constituted nearly the whole of his fortune.</p>
              <p> 　　Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself, 
                by dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection 
                of rare copies of every sort.</p>
              <p> 　　He never went out without a book under his arm, and he often 
                returned with two.</p>
              <p> 　　The sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor, 
                which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed herbariums, and 
                engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilled 
                his blood.</p>
              <p> 　　He had never approached a cannon in his life, even at the 
                Invalides.</p>
              <p> 　　He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a cure, perfectly 
                white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling 
                in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of 
                an old sheep, and he was easily frightened.</p>
              <p> 　　Add to this, that he had no other friendship, no other acquaintance 
                among the living, than an old bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, 
                named Royal.</p>
              <p> 　　His dream was to naturalize indigo in France.</p>
              <p> 　　His servant was also a sort of innocent.</p>
              <p> 　　The poor good old woman was a spinster.</p>
              <p> 　　Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri's miserere 
                in the Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the 
                quantity of passion which existed in her.</p>
              <p> 　　None of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man.</p>
              <p> 　　She had never been able to get further than her cat.</p>
              <p> 　　Like him, she had a mustache.</p>
              <p> 　　Her glory consisted in her caps, which were always white.</p>
              <p> 　　She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in counting over 
                the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses 
                in the piece which she bought and never had made up.</p>
              <p> 　　She knew how to read.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being 
                young and gentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. 
                Youth combined with gentleness produces on old people the effect 
                of the sun without wind.</p>
              <p> 　　When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder, 
                with marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious 
                battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous 
                blows of the sword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked 
                to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers.</p>
              <p> 　　His brother the cure died about 1830, and almost immediately, 
                as when the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for 
                M. Mabeuf. A notary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand 
                francs, which was all that he possessed in his brother's right 
                and his own. The Revolution of July brought a crisis to publishing.</p>
              <p> 　　In a period of embarrassment, the first thing which does not 
                sell is a Flora. The Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz stopped 
                short.</p>
              <p> 　　Weeks passed by without a single purchaser.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Mother Plutarque sadly, &quot;it 
                is the water-carrier.&quot; In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted 
                the Rue Mesieres, abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, 
                sold not a part of his books, but of his prints,-- that to which 
                he was the least attached,--and installed himself in a little 
                house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but 
                one quarter for two reasons:</p>
              <p> 　　in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three 
                hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs 
                on his rent; in the second, being near Faton's shooting-gallery, 
                he could hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, 
                his portfolios, and his books, and established himself near the 
                Salpetriere, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, 
                where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden 
                enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well.</p>
              <p> 　　He took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his 
                furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new quarters, he 
                was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings and 
                herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden 
                the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque 
                had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on 
                the shoulder and said to her with a smile:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have the indigo!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques 
                and Marius, were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, 
                a brawling name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed 
                in some bit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both 
                at once, are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life. 
                Their own destiny is a far-off thing to them.</p>
              <p> 　　There results from such concentration a passivity, which, 
                if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble philosophy.</p>
              <p> 　　One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away, 
                and yet is hardly conscious of it one's self. It always ends, 
                it is true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the 
                meantime, it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the 
                game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness. 
                We are the stake, and we look on at the game with indifference.</p>
              <p> 　　It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, 
                when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf 
                remained rather puerilely, but profoundly serene.</p>
              <p> 　　His habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum.</p>
              <p> 　　Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very long time, 
                even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not stop 
                short at the precise moment when the key is lost.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures.</p>
              <p> 　　These pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected; the merest 
                chance furnished them.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, Mother Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner 
                of the room. She was reading aloud, finding that she understood 
                better thus. To read aloud is to assure one's self of what one 
                is reading. There are people who read very loud, and who have 
                the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to 
                what they are perusing.</p>
              <p> 　　It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was 
                reading the romance which she had in hand.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to her.</p>
              <p> 　　In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this 
                phrase. It was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;--The beauty pouted, and the dragoon--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bouddha and the Dragon,&quot; struck in M. Mabeuf in 
                a low voice. &quot;Yes, it is true that there was a dragon, which, 
                from the depths of its cave, spouted flame through his maw and 
                set the heavens on fire. Many stars had already been consumed 
                by this monster, which, besides, had the claws of a tiger.</p>
              <p> 　　Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the 
                dragon.</p>
              <p> 　　That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no more beautiful legend in existence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious revery.</p>

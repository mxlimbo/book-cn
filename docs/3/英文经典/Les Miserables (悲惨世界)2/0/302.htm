              <p> 　　 In the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern 
                in the Rue du Chaume, entered the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, 
                and not seeing &quot;even a cat&quot; there, he thought the opportunity 
                a good one to strike up all the song of which he was capable.</p>
              <p> 　　His march, far from being retarded by his singing, was accelerated 
                by it.</p>
              <p> 　　He began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these 
                incendiary couplets:-- </p>

              <p> 　　 My friend Pierrot, thou pratest, because Mila knocked at 
                her pane the other day and called me.</p>
              <p> 　　The jades are very charming, their poison which bewitched 
                me would intoxicate Monsieur Orfila. I'm fond of love and its 
                bickerings, I love Agnes, I love Pamela, Lise burned herself in 
                setting me aflame.</p>
              <p> 　　In former days when I saw the mantillas of Suzette and of 
                Zeila, my soul mingled with their folds.</p>
              <p> 　　Love, when thou gleamest in the dark thou crownest Lola with 
                roses, I would lose my soul for that.</p>
              <p> 　　Jeanne, at thy mirror thou deckest thyself!</p>
              <p> 　　One fine day, my heart flew forth. I think that it is Jeanne 
                who has it.</p>
              <p> 　　At night, when I come from the quadrilles, I show Stella to 
                the stars, and I say to them: &quot;Behold her.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Where fair maids go, lon la.</p>
              <p> 　　 Gavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime.</p>
              <p> 　　Gesture is the strong point of the refrain.</p>
              <p> 　　His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks, produced grimaces 
                more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn 
                in a high gale.</p>
              <p> 　　Unfortunately, as he was alone, and as it was night, this 
                was neither seen nor even visible. Such wastes of riches do occur.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, he stopped short.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let us interrupt the romance,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　His feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage 
                door, what is called in painting, an ensemble, that is to say, 
                a person and a thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was 
                a man from Auvergene who was sleeping therein.</p>
              <p> 　　The shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat's 
                head was supported against the front of the cart.</p>
              <p> 　　His body was coiled up on this inclined plane and his feet 
                touched the ground.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, 
                recognized a drunken man.</p>
              <p> 　　He was some corner errand-man who had drunk too much and was 
                sleeping too much.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now,&quot; thought Gavroche, &quot;that's what 
                the summer nights are good for.</p>
              <p> 　　We'll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat 
                for the Monarchy.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How bully that cart would look on our barricade!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Auvergnat was snoring.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the 
                Auvergnat from the front, that is to say, by the feet, and at 
                the expiration of another minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was 
                reposing flat on the pavement.</p>
              <p> 　　The cart was free.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, 
                had everything about him.</p>
              <p> 　　He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from it a scrap 
                of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter.</p>
              <p> 　　He wrote:-- </p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;French Republic.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　 &quot;Received thy cart.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he signed it:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;GAVROCHE.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring 
                Auvergnat's velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, 
                and set off in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before 
                him at a hard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar.</p>
              <p> 　　This was perilous.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment. Gavroche 
                did not think of this.</p>
              <p> 　　This post was occupied by the National Guards of the suburbs.</p>
              <p> 　　The squad began to wake up, and heads were raised from camp 
                beds.</p>
              <p> 　　Two street lanterns broken in succession, that ditty sung 
                at the top of the lungs. This was a great deal for those cowardly 
                streets, which desire to go to sleep at sunset, and which put 
                the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour.</p>
              <p> 　　For the last hour, that boy had been creating an uproar in 
                that peaceable arrondissement, the uproar of a fly in a bottle.</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear. He waited.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a prudent man.</p>
              <p> 　　The mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible 
                measure of waiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There's a whole band of them there!&quot; said he, &quot;let 
                us proceed gently.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its 
                box and that it was stalking abroad through the quarter.</p>
              <p> 　　And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and 
                at the very moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des 
                Vielles-Haudriettes, found himself face to face with a uniform, 
                a shako, a plume, and a gun.</p>
              <p> 　　For the second time, he stopped short.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hullo,&quot; said he, &quot;it's him.</p>
              <p> 　　Good day, public order.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going, you rascal?&quot; shouted the sergeant.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Citizen,&quot; retorted Gavroche, &quot;I haven't called 
                you `bourgeois' yet. Why do you insult me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going, you rogue?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur,&quot; retorted Gavroche, &quot;perhaps you 
                were a man of wit yesterday, but you have degenerated this morning.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I ask you where are you going, you villain?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You speak prettily.</p>
              <p> 　　Really, no one would suppose you as old as you are.</p>
              <p> 　　You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. 
                That would yield you five hundred francs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are you going?</p>
              <p> 　　Where are you going?</p>
              <p> 　　Where are you going, bandit?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche retorted again:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What villainous words!</p>
              <p> 　　You must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give 
                you suck.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The sergeant lowered his bayonet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;General,&quot; said Gavroche &quot;I'm on my way to 
                look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To arms!&quot; shouted the sergeant.</p>
              <p> 　　The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves 
                by the very means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the 
                whole situation at a glance.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the cart which had told against him, it was the cart's 
                place to protect him.</p>
              <p> 　　At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making 
                his descent on Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile 
                and launched with all the latter's might, rolled down upon him 
                furiously, and the sergeant, struck full in the stomach, tumbled 
                over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air.</p>
              <p> 　　The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant's 
                shout; the shot brought on a general random discharge, after which 
                they reloaded their weapons and began again.</p>
              <p> 　　This blind-man's-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an 
                hour and killed several panes of glass.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at 
                full speed, halted five or six streets distant and seated himself, 
                panting, on the stone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.</p>
              <p> 　　He listened.</p>
              <p> 　　After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction 
                where the fusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level 
                with his nose and thrust it forward three times, as he slapped 
                the back of his head with his right hand; an imperious gesture 
                in which Parisian street-urchindom has condensed French irony, 
                and which is evidently efficacious, since it has already lasted 
                half a century.</p>
              <p> 　　This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;I'm splitting with laughter, 
                I'm twisting with delight, I abound in joy, but I'm losing my 
                way, I shall have to take a roundabout way.</p>
              <p> 　　If I only reach the barricade in season!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thereupon he set out again on a run.</p>
              <p> 　　And as he ran:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah, by the way, where was I?&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　And he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the 
                streets, and this is what died away in the gloom:-- </p>

              <p> 　　 [57] But some prisons still remain, and I am going to put 
                a stop to this sort of public order.</p>
              <p> 　　Does any one wish to play at skittles? The whole ancient world 
                fell in ruin, when the big ball rolled. Good old folks, let us 
                smash with our crutches that Louvre where the monarchy displayed 
                itself in furbelows.</p>
              <p> 　　We have forced its gates. On that day, King Charles X. did 
                not stick well and came unglued.</p>
              <p> 　　 The post's recourse to arms was not without result.</p>
              <p> 　　The cart was conquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner.</p>
              <p> 　　The first was put in the pound, the second was later on somewhat 
                harassed before the councils of war as an accomplice.</p>
              <p> 　　The public ministry of the day proved its indefatigable zeal 
                in the defence of society, in this instance.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche's adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in 
                the quarters of the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs 
                of the elderly bourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their 
                memories: &quot;The nocturnal attack by the post of the Royal 
                Printing Establishment.&quot;</p>

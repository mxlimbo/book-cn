              <p> 　　AN OWL'S VIEW OF PARIS</p>
              <p> 　　 A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with 
                the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes 
                a gloomy spectacle.</p>
              <p> 　　All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within 
                a city, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, 
                where a thousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had 
                made their redoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to 
                him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre 
                of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed windows, 
                there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased.</p>
              <p> 　　The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch 
                everywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, night.</p>
              <p> 　　The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers 
                in a vast obscurity, to multiply every combatant by the possibilities 
                which that obscurity contains. At dusk, every window where a candle 
                was burning received a shot. The light was extinguished, sometimes 
                the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; 
                and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long 
                rows of windows and stores, the indentations of the chimneys, 
                and the roofs, and the vague reflections which are cast back by 
                the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward 
                at that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse 
                here and there, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought 
                out broken and eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, 
                something like the lights which go and come in ruins; it was at 
                such points that the barricades were situated. The rest was a 
                lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal, above which, in 
                motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques, 
                the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of those grand 
                edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.</p>
              <p> 　　All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the 
                quarters where the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, 
                and where a few street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer 
                might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, 
                the dull rumble of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions 
                whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute; a formidable 
                girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous 
                cavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, 
                and, as we have just seen, any street which one might come to 
                offered nothing but darkness.</p>
              <p> 　　A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable 
                shocks, into which it was alarming to penetrate, and in which 
                it was terrible to remain, where those who entered shivered before 
                those whom they awaited, where those who waited shuddered before 
                those who were coming. Invisible combatants were entrenched at 
                every corner of the street; snares of the sepulchre concealed 
                in the density of night. All was over.</p>
              <p> 　　No more light was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the 
                lightning of guns, no further encounter except the abrupt and 
                rapid apparition of death.</p>
              <p> 　　Where?</p>
              <p> 　　How?</p>
              <p> 　　When?</p>
              <p> 　　No one knew, but it was certain and inevitable.</p>
              <p> 　　In this place which had been marked out for the struggle, 
                the Government and the insurrection, the National Guard, and popular 
                societies, the bourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, 
                were about to come into contact. The necessity was the same for 
                both.</p>
              <p> 　　The only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed 
                or conquerors.</p>
              <p> 　　A situation so extreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the 
                most timid felt themselves seized with resolution, and the most 
                daring with terror.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination 
                were equal.</p>
              <p> 　　For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed 
                of retreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one 
                dreamed of flight.</p>
              <p> 　　It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following 
                day, that triumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection 
                should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish.</p>
              <p> 　　The Government understood this as well as the parties; the 
                most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hence a thought of anguish 
                which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where 
                all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubled anxiety 
                around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging.</p>
              <p> 　　Here only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rending 
                as the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin 
                of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the 
                clamor of that wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　As it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord 
                with what men were about to do.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect.</p>
              <p> 　　The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon 
                with their melancholy folds.</p>
              <p> 　　A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though an immense 
                winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb.</p>
              <p> 　　While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation 
                in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary 
                events, while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in 
                the name of principles, and the middle classes, in the name of 
                interests, were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves 
                together, clasping and throwing each other, while each one hastened 
                and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis, far away 
                and quite outside of this fatal quarter, in the most profound 
                depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old Paris 
                which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent Paris, 
                the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance 
                to a dull roar.</p>
              <p> 　　A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of 
                the brute and of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and 
                which warns the wise, which comes both from below like the voice 
                of the lion, and from on high like the voice of the thunder.</p>

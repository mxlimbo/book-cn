              <p> 　　THE CHAIN-GANG</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two.</p>
              <p> 　　Youth, even in its sorrows, always possesses its own peculiar 
                radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became 
                puerile. It is the property of grief to cause the childish side 
                of man to reappear.</p>
              <p> 　　He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping 
                from him.</p>
              <p> 　　He would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her 
                enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, 
                puerile, as we have just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed 
                to him, by their very childishness, a tolerably just notion of 
                the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls. 
                He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, 
                pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. 
                He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would be, he said 
                to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable 
                thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be dazzled, 
                and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the 
                Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would 
                suffice for Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young 
                men.</p>
              <p> 　　An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.</p>
              <p> 　　In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come 
                to dwell in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They 
                sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species 
                of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those 
                who are quitting it.</p>
              <p> 　　For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is 
                equivalent to a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature 
                added. The streets are deserted and the birds are singing.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, a bird herself, liked to rise early.</p>
              <p> 　　These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening.</p>
              <p> 　　He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, 
                they set out before daybreak, and these trips were so many small 
                delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities please young 
                people.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the 
                least frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. 
                There then existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, 
                a sort of poor meadows, which were almost confounded with the 
                city, where grew in summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, 
                after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, 
                not of having been reaped, but peeled.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was not bored there.</p>
              <p> 　　It meant solitude to him and liberty to her.</p>
              <p> 　　There, she became a little girl once more, she could run and 
                almost play; she took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, 
                and gathered bunches of flowers. She gazed at the butterflies 
                on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness and tenderness 
                are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her 
                breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of 
                a butterfly.</p>
              <p> 　　She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, 
                and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing until 
                they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.</p>
              <p> 　　Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom 
                of early strolls.</p>
              <p> 　　One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection 
                of the autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break 
                of day near the Barriere du Maine.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a delightful and stern moment.</p>
              <p> 　　A few constellations here and there in the deep, pale azure, 
                the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver amid the 
                blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight.</p>
              <p> 　　A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling 
                at a prodigious height, and one would have declared that that 
                hymn of pettiness calmed immensity.</p>
              <p> 　　In the East, the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the 
                clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant 
                was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its 
                escape from a gloomy edifice.</p>
              <p> 　　All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a 
                few stray laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were 
                on their way to their work along the side-paths.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited 
                at the gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the 
                highway, his back towards the light; he had forgotten the sun 
                which was on the point of rising; he had sunk into one of those 
                profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated, which 
                imprison even the eye, and which are equivalent to four walls.</p>
              <p> 　　There are meditations which may be called vertical; when one 
                is at the bottom of them, time is required to return to earth.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries.</p>
              <p> 　　He was thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible 
                if nothing came between him and her, of the light with which she 
                filled his life, a light which was but the emanation of her soul.</p>
              <p> 　　He was almost happy in his revery.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the clouds 
                as they turned rosy.</p>
              <p> 　　All at once Cosette exclaimed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I should think some one was coming yonder.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean raised his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was right.</p>
              <p> 　　The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere du Maine 
                is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sevres, 
                and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow 
                of the causeway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, 
                they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that 
                hour, and a sort of confused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless 
                thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the 
                road.</p>
              <p> 　　It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though 
                it was bristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but 
                its load could not be distinctly made out.</p>
              <p> 　　There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips were cracking.</p>
              <p> 　　By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed in shadows.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the 
                boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course 
                towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of 
                the same aspect, followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven 
                chariots made their appearance in succession, the heads of the 
                horses touching the rear of the wagon in front. Figures were moving 
                on these vehicles, flashes were visible through the dusk as though 
                there were naked swords there, a clanking became audible which 
                resembled the rattling of chains, and as this something advanced, 
                the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned into a terrible 
                thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.</p>
              <p> 　　As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind 
                the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew 
                white; the day, which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on 
                this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living, 
                the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses, and 
                this is what it proved to be:--</p>
              <p> 　　Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road.</p>
              <p> 　　The first six were singularly constructed.</p>
              <p> 　　They resembled coopers' drays; they consisted of long ladders 
                placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities.</p>
              <p> 　　Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached 
                to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters 
                of men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to 
                be divined rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve 
                on a side, back to back, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling 
                in the air,--this was the manner in which these men were travelling, 
                and behind their backs they had something which clanked, and which 
                was a chain, and on their necks something which shone, and which 
                was an iron collar. Each man had his collar, but the chain was 
                for all; so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to 
                alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with a sort of 
                inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground with 
                the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds.</p>
              <p> 　　In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with 
                muskets stood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his 
                foot.</p>
              <p> 　　The iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge 
                rack-sided baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and 
                six horses, and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron 
                pots, braziers, and chains, among which were mingled several men 
                who were pinioned and stretched at full length, and who seemed 
                to be ill.</p>
              <p> 　　This wagon, all lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated 
                hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments.</p>
              <p> 　　These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. On each side 
                marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered 
                hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with 
                spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers 
                of undertakers' men, half gray, half blue, which were almost hanging 
                in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short sabres, 
                muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards. 
                These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar 
                and the authority of the executioner. The one who appeared to 
                be their chief held a postilion's whip in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　All these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became 
                more and more clearly outlined as the light increased. At the 
                head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious 
                and with sword in fist.</p>
              <p> 　　This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached 
                the barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. 
                A throng, sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in 
                a twinkling, as is frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward 
                from both sides of the road and looked on.</p>
              <p> 　　In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each 
                other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to 
                gaze were audible.</p>
              <p> 　　The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted 
                along in silence.</p>
              <p> 　　They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen 
                trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes.</p>
              <p> 　　The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their 
                accoutrements were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal 
                than the harlequin in rags.</p>
              <p> 　　Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, 
                and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at 
                the elbow; many wore women's headgear, others had baskets on their 
                heads; hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in their 
                garments tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, 
                flaming hearts, Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could 
                also be seen.</p>
              <p> 　　Two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of 
                the dray, and suspended under them like a stirrup, which supported 
                their feet.</p>
              <p> 　　One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something 
                which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed 
                to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were no 
                eyes there which were not either dry, dulled, or flaming with 
                an evil light.</p>
              <p> 　　The escort troop cursed, the men in chains did not utter a 
                syllable; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible 
                as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls; some of 
                these men were yawning; their rags were terrible; their feet hung 
                down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed together, 
                their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their fists 
                clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the 
                rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.</p>
              <p> 　　This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. 
                It was evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain 
                might descend, that it might be followed by another and another, 
                and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once 
                soaked, these men would not get dry again, that once chilled, 
                they would not again get warm, that their linen trousers would 
                be glued to their bones by the downpour, that the water would 
                fill their shoes, that no lashes from the whips would be able 
                to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the chain would continue 
                to bind them by the neck, that their legs would continue to dangle, 
                and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human 
                beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, 
                and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies 
                of the air, like trees and stones.</p>
              <p> 　　Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of 
                the sick men, who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless 
                on the seventh wagon, and who appeared to have been tossed there 
                like sacks filled with misery.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of 
                the Orient burst forth, and one would have said that it had set 
                fire to all those ferocious heads.</p>
              <p> 　　Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins, oaths, 
                and songs exploded.</p>
              <p> 　　The broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two 
                parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheels 
                in the obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　Thoughts made their appearance on these faces; it was a terrible 
                moment; visible demons with their masks removed, fierce souls 
                laid bare.</p>
              <p> 　　Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in gloom.</p>
              <p> 　　Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which 
                they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn 
                accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its 
                shadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed 
                by reason of wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that 
                one would have said that the sun's brilliancy had been changed 
                into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load which headed the 
                line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of their 
                voices with a haggard joviality, a potpourri by Desaugiers, then 
                famous, called The Vestal; the trees shivered mournfully; in the 
                cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic 
                delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres.</p>
              <p> 　　All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; 
                here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, 
                old men, youths, bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, 
                sour resignation, savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted 
                by caps, heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls 
                on the temples, infantile visages, and by reason of that, horrible 
                thin skeleton faces, to which death alone was lacking.</p>
              <p> 　　On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave, in all 
                probability, and who could make a comparison of his chains.</p>
              <p> 　　The frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over 
                these brows; at that degree of abasement, the last transformations 
                were suffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance, 
                converted into dulness, was the equal of intelligence converted 
                into despair.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no choice possible between these men who appeared 
                to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident that the person 
                who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified 
                them.</p>
              <p> 　　These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical 
                disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by 
                evolving a result; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, 
                each chain exhaled a common soul, and each dray-load had its own 
                physiognomy.</p>
              <p> 　　By the side of the one where they were singing, there was 
                one where they were howling; a third where they were begging; 
                one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; another 
                load menaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last 
                was as silent as the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld 
                his seven circles of hell on the march.</p>
              <p> 　　The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister 
                wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, 
                but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet cart.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, 
                made a pretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of 
                human filth. An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her 
                little boy five years old, and said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rascal, let that be a warning to you!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared 
                to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that 
                signal a fearful dull and blind flogging, which produced the sound 
                of hail, fell upon the seven dray-loads; many roared and foamed 
                at the mouth; which redoubled the delight of the street urchins 
                who had hastened up, a swarm of flies on these wounds.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They 
                were no longer eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which 
                replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men, which 
                seem unconscious of reality, and in which flames the reflection 
                of terrors and of catastrophes.</p>
              <p> 　　He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a vision.</p>
              <p> 　　He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not 
                move his feet.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold 
                you fast.</p>
              <p> 　　He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking 
                himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this 
                sepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium 
                which was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his 
                brow, a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; 
                he remembered that this was, in fact, the usual itinerary, that 
                it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility 
                of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, 
                five and thirty years before, he had himself passed through that 
                barrier.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not understand; what she beheld did not seem to her 
                to be possible; at length she cried:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father!</p>
              <p> 　　What are those men in those carts?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Convicts.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whither are they going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the galleys.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, 
                became zealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled 
                with it, it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts 
                bent before it, a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture, 
                and all held their peace, darting glances like chained wolves.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, are they still men?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sometimes,&quot; answered the unhappy man.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak 
                from Bicetre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid 
                Fontainebleau, where the King then was.</p>
              <p> 　　This caused the horrible journey to last three or four days 
                longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of 
                sparing the royal personage a sight of it.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed.</p>
              <p> 　　Such encounters are shocks, and the memory that they leave 
                behind them resembles a thorough shaking up.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way 
                back to the Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying 
                him with other questions on the subject of what they had just 
                seen; perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to 
                notice her words and reply to them.</p>
              <p> 　　But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake 
                herself to bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though 
                talking to herself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those 
                men in my pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight 
                of him close at hand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic 
                day, there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,-- 
                fetes in Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, 
                theatrical performances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at the 
                Arc de l'Etoile, illuminations everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and took Cosette 
                to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her from 
                the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling 
                tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before 
                her.</p>
              <p> 　　The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence 
                of uniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform 
                of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who 
                is betaking himself to shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette, who 
                made it her law to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all 
                spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion with the light 
                and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too disdainfully 
                at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete; so that Jean 
                Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no 
                trace of that hideous vision remained.</p>
              <p> 　　Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, 
                and they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another 
                infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed 
                upon himself, and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which 
                melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, 
                was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which 
                envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the 
                effect of a cloud drawn over a star; and, with her head bathed 
                in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glances 
                of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette did not know the delightful legend, I love a little, 
                passionately, etc.--who was there who could have taught her?</p>
              <p> 　　She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without 
                a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a 
                heart.</p>
              <p> 　　If there were a fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, 
                she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated 
                by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and 
                forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child.</p>
              <p> 　　A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side.</p>
              <p> 　　White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one 
                would have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette 
                went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed 
                to be thinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be 
                something charming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder 
                with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, what are the galleys like?&quot;<br>

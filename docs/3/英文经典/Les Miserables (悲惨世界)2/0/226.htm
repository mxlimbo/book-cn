              <p> 　　1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected 
                with the Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and 
                striking moments of history.</p>
              <p> 　　These two years rise like two mountains midway between those 
                which precede and those which follow them.</p>
              <p> 　　They have a revolutionary grandeur.</p>
              <p> 　　Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses, 
                the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed 
                and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient 
                French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant, 
                athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. 
                These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement 
                and resistance.</p>
              <p> 　　At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can 
                be descried shining there.</p>
              <p> 　　This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning 
                to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the 
                principal lines even at the present day.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall make the attempt.</p>
              <p> 　　The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, 
                hard to define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, 
                tumult, and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great 
                nation at a halting-place.</p>
              <p> 　　These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who 
                desire to convert them to profit.</p>
              <p> 　　In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but repose; it thirsts 
                for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition, to be small.</p>
              <p> 　　Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great events, 
                great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have 
                seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads.</p>
              <p> 　　We would exchange Caesar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the 
                King of Yvetot. &quot;What a good little king was he!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　We have marched since daybreak, we have reached the evening 
                of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first change with 
                Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with Bonaparte; 
                we are worn out.</p>
              <p> 　　Each one demands a bed.</p>
              <p> 　　Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions 
                which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, 
                solicit, what?</p>
              <p> 　　A shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　They have it.</p>
              <p> 　　They take possession of peace, of tranquillity, of leisure; 
                behold, they are content.</p>
              <p> 　　But, at the same time certain facts arise, compel recognition, 
                and knock at the door in their turn.</p>
              <p> 　　These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they 
                are, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in 
                society, and they do install themselves therein; and most of the 
                time, facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers[32] 
                who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles.</p>
              <p> 　　 [32] In olden times, fouriers were the officials who preceded 
                the Court and allotted the lodgings.</p>
              <p> 　　 This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:--</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished 
                facts demand guarantees.</p>
              <p> 　　Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; 
                this is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.</p>
              <p> 　　These guarantees are a necessity of the times.</p>
              <p> 　　They must be accorded. Princes &quot;grant&quot; them, but 
                in reality, it is the force of things which gives them.</p>
              <p> 　　A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts 
                did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain 
                a glimpse of in 1814.</p>
              <p> 　　The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon 
                fell, had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which 
                bestowed, and that what it had bestowed it could take back again; 
                that the House of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France 
                possessed nothing, and that the political right conceded in the 
                charter of Louis XVIII. was merely a branch of the right divine, 
                was detached by the House of Bourbon and graciously given to the 
                people until such day as it should please the King to reassume 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, the House of Bourbon should have felt, from the displeasure 
                created by the gift, that it did not come from it.</p>
              <p> 　　This house was churlish to the nineteenth century.</p>
              <p> 　　It put on an ill-tempered look at every development of the 
                nation.</p>
              <p> 　　To make use of a trivial word, that is to say, of a popular 
                and a true word, it looked glum.</p>
              <p> 　　The people saw this.</p>
              <p> 　　It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been 
                carried away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did 
                not perceive that it had, itself, been brought in in the same 
                fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　It did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had 
                removed Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　It thought that it had roots, because it was the past.</p>
              <p> 　　It was mistaken; it formed a part of the past, but the whole 
                past was France. The roots of French society were not fixed in 
                the Bourbons, but in the nations.</p>
              <p> 　　These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right 
                of a family, but the history of a people. They were everywhere, 
                except under the throne.</p>
              <p> 　　The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding 
                knot in her history, but was no longer the principal element of 
                her destiny, and the necessary base of her politics.</p>
              <p> 　　She could get along without the Bourbons; she had done without 
                them for two and twenty years; there had been a break of continuity; 
                they did not suspect the fact. And how should they have suspected 
                it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, 
                and that Louis XVIII.</p>
              <p> 　　was reigning at the battle of Marengo?</p>
              <p> 　　Never, since the origin of history, had princes been so blind 
                in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which 
                facts contain and promulgate.</p>
              <p> 　　Never had that pretension here below which is called the right 
                of kings denied to such a point the right from on high.</p>
              <p> 　　A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once 
                more on the guarantees &quot;granted&quot; in 1814, on the concessions, 
                as it termed them.</p>
              <p> 　　Sad.</p>
              <p> 　　A sad thing!</p>
              <p> 　　What it termed its concessions were our conquests; what it 
                termed our encroachments were our rights.</p>
              <p> 　　When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, 
                supposing itself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in 
                the country, that is to say, believing itself to be strong and 
                deep, abruptly decided on its plan of action, and risked its stroke. 
                One morning it drew itself up before the face of France, and, 
                elevating its voice, it contested the collective title and the 
                individual right of the nation to sovereignty, of the citizen 
                to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation that which 
                made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a citizen.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called 
                the ordinances of July.</p>
              <p> 　　The Restoration fell.</p>
              <p> 　　It fell justly.</p>
              <p> 　　But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms 
                of progress.</p>
              <p> 　　Great things had been accomplished, with it alongside.</p>
              <p> 　　Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to 
                calm discussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and 
                to grandeur in peace, which had been wanting under the Empire.</p>
              <p> 　　France free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle 
                to the other peoples of Europe. The Revolution had had the word 
                under Robespierre; the cannon had had the word under Bonaparte; 
                it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. that it was the turn 
                of intelligence to have the word.</p>
              <p> 　　The wind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty 
                heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, 
                useful, and charming spectacle.</p>
              <p> 　　For a space of fifteen years, those great principles which 
                are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could be 
                seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality 
                before the law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty 
                of the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus it proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument 
                of civilization which broke in the hands of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their 
                side, but on the side of the nation.</p>
              <p> 　　They quitted the throne with gravity, but without authority; 
                their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances 
                which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was neither the spectral 
                calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of Napoleon.</p>
              <p> 　　They departed, that is all.</p>
              <p> 　　They laid down the crown, and retained no aureole.</p>
              <p> 　　They were worthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in 
                a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles X. 
                during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be 
                cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about 
                imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution 
                saddened devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men 
                who honored their race.</p>
              <p> 　　The populace was admirable.</p>
              <p> 　　The nation, attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort of 
                royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession of so much force 
                that it did not go into a rage.</p>
              <p> 　　It defended itself, restrained itself, restored things to 
                their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! 
                and then halted!</p>
              <p> 　　It took the old king Charles X. from beneath that dais which 
                had sheltered Louis XIV.</p>
              <p> 　　and set him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages 
                only with sadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not 
                a few men, it was France, France entire, France victorious and 
                intoxicated with her victory, who seemed to be coming to herself, 
                and who put into practice, before the eyes of the whole world, 
                these grave words of Guillaume du Vair after the day of the Barricades:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the 
                favors of the great, and to spring, like a bird from bough to 
                bough, from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show 
                themselves harsh towards their Prince in his adversity; but as 
                for me, the fortune of my Kings and especially of my afflicted 
                Kings, will always be venerable to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. 
                As we have just stated, their misfortune was greater than they 
                were. They faded out in the horizon.</p>
              <p> 　　The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout 
                the entire world.</p>
              <p> 　　The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the others 
                turned away, each according to his nature.</p>
              <p> 　　At the first blush, the princes of Europe, the owls of this 
                dawn, shut their eyes, wounded and stupefied, and only opened 
                them to threaten. A fright which can be comprehended, a wrath 
                which can be pardoned. This strange revolution had hardly produced 
                a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor 
                of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood.</p>
              <p> 　　In the eyes of despotic governments, who are always interested 
                in having liberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed 
                the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing, however, was attempted or plotted against it.</p>
              <p> 　　The most discontented, the most irritated, the most trembling, 
                saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a mysterious 
                respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration 
                of some one who is working above man.</p>
              <p> 　　The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing 
                the fact. A thing which is full of splendor.</p>
              <p> 　　Right overthrowing the fact.</p>
              <p> 　　Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of 1830, hence, also, 
                its mildness.</p>
              <p> 　　Right triumphant has no need of being violent.</p>
              <p> 　　Right is the just and the true.</p>
              <p> 　　The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and 
                pure. The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even 
                when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only 
                as a fact, and if it contain only too little of right, or none 
                at all, is infallibly destined to become, in the course of time, 
                deformed, impure, perhaps, even monstrous.</p>
              <p> 　　If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of hideousness 
                the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries, let 
                him look at Machiavelli.</p>
              <p> 　　Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable 
                and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact.</p>
              <p> 　　And he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, 
                the fact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he 
                is, in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.</p>
              <p> 　　This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since 
                the origin of society.</p>
              <p> 　　To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the 
                humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the 
                fact and the fact into right, that is the task of sages.</p>

              <p> 　　THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR</p>
              <p> 　　 One day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, 
                and she said to herself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Really!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to her almost that she was pretty.</p>
              <p> 　　This threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind.</p>
              <p> 　　Up to that moment she had never thought of her face. She saw 
                herself in her mirror, but she did not look at herself. And then, 
                she had so often been told that she was homely; Jean Valjean alone 
                said gently:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No indeed! no indeed!&quot; At all events, Cosette had 
                always thought herself homely, and had grown up in that belief 
                with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all at once, 
                was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No indeed!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That night, she did not sleep.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What if I were pretty!&quot; she thought.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How odd it would be if I were pretty!&quot; And she 
                recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation 
                in the convent, and she said to herself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident 
                this time, and she was assailed with doubts:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where did I get such an idea?&quot; said she; &quot;no, 
                I am ugly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes were sunken 
                and she was pale.</p>
              <p> 　　She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the 
                belief that she was beautiful, but it made her very sad not to 
                be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look at herself 
                again, and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair 
                with her back turned to the mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in 
                wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean 
                Valjean read beside her.</p>
              <p> 　　Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered quite 
                uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.</p>
              <p> 　　On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and 
                it seemed to her that some one behind her, whom she did not see, 
                said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A pretty woman! but badly dressed.&quot; &quot;Bah!&quot; 
                she thought, &quot;he does not mean me.</p>
              <p> 　　I am well dressed and ugly.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown.</p>
              <p> 　　At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor 
                old Toussaint saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?&quot; 
                Cosette did not hear her father's reply, but Toussaint's words 
                caused a sort of commotion within her.</p>
              <p> 　　She fled from the garden, ran up to her room, flew to the 
                looking-glass,--it was three months since she had looked at herself,--and 
                gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzled herself.</p>
              <p> 　　She was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing 
                with Toussaint and her mirror.</p>
              <p> 　　Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her hair 
                was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her 
                blue eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, 
                like the sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, 
                Toussaint had said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by 
                had spoken, there could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended 
                to the garden again, thinking herself a queen, imagining that 
                she heard the birds singing, though it was winter, seeing the 
                sky gilded, the sun among the trees, flowers in the thickets, 
                distracted, wild, in inexpressible delight.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable 
                oppression at heart.</p>
              <p> 　　In fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with 
                terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day 
                on Cosette's sweet face.</p>
              <p> 　　The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before 
                she became aware of it herself.</p>
              <p> 　　But, from the very first day, that unexpected light which 
                was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl's 
                person, wounded Jean Valjean's sombre eye. He felt that it was 
                a change in a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare 
                to move for fear of disarranging something. This man, who had 
                passed through all manner of distresses, who was still all bleeding 
                from the bruises of fate, who had been almost wicked and who had 
                become almost a saint, who, after having dragged the chain of 
                the galleys, was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of 
                indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not released from 
                its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back 
                from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public 
                opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, 
                and merely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, 
                of nature, of the world, one thing, that Cosette might love him!</p>
              <p> 　　That Cosette might continue to love him!</p>
              <p> 　　That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming 
                to him, and from remaining with him! Beloved by Cosette, he felt 
                that he was healed, rested, appeased, loaded with benefits, recompensed, 
                crowned.</p>
              <p> 　　Beloved by Cosette, it was well with him!</p>
              <p> 　　He asked nothing more!</p>
              <p> 　　Had any one said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you want anything better?&quot; he would have answered: 
                &quot;No.&quot; God might have said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you desire heaven?&quot; and he would have replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I should lose by it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the 
                surface, made him shudder like the beginning of something new.</p>
              <p> 　　He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty 
                of a woman means; but he understood instinctively, that it was 
                something terrible.</p>
              <p> 　　He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming 
                out ever more triumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very 
                eyes, on the innocent and formidable brow of that child, from 
                the depths of her homeliness, of his old age, of his misery, of 
                his reprobation.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How beautiful she is!</p>
              <p> 　　What is to become of me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness 
                and the tenderness of a mother.</p>
              <p> 　　What he beheld with anguish, a mother would have gazed upon 
                with joy.</p>
              <p> 　　The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself: 
                &quot;Decidedly I am beautiful!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet.</p>
              <p> 　　She recalled the remark of that passer-by: &quot;Pretty, but 
                badly dressed,&quot; the breath of an oracle which had passed 
                beside her and had vanished, after depositing in her heart one 
                of the two germs which are destined, later on, to fill the whole 
                life of woman, coquetry.</p>
              <p> 　　Love is the other.</p>
              <p> 　　With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded 
                within her. She conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame 
                for her plush hat. Her father had never refused her anything.</p>
              <p> 　　She at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet, the 
                gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuff which is in fashion, 
                the color which is becoming, that science which makes of the Parisian 
                woman something so charming, so deep, and so dangerous.</p>
              <p> 　　The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne.</p>
              <p> 　　In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the 
                Rue de Babylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of 
                the &quot;best dressed&quot; women in Paris, which means a great 
                deal more.</p>
              <p> 　　She would have liked to encounter her &quot;passer-by,&quot; 
                to see what he would say, and to &quot;teach him a lesson!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The truth is, that she was ravishing in every respect, and 
                that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard 
                and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety.</p>
              <p> 　　He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl, walk 
                at the most, beheld wings sprouting on Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette's toilet, a 
                woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain 
                little proprieties, certain special conventionalities, were not 
                observed by Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girl 
                does not dress in damask.</p>
              <p> 　　The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown 
                and mantle, and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean's 
                arm, gay, radiant, rosy, proud, dazzling.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father,&quot; she said, &quot;how do you like me in 
                this guise?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter 
                voice of an envious man:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Charming!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He was the same as usual during their walk.</p>
              <p> 　　On their return home, he asked Cosette:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again,--you 
                know the ones I mean?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This took place in Cosette's chamber.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl's 
                clothes were hanging.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That disguise!&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, what do you want me to do with it? Oh no, the 
                idea!</p>
              <p> 　　I shall never put on those horrors again. With that machine 
                on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.</p>
              <p> 　　From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always 
                heretofore asked to remain at home, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Father, I enjoy myself more here with you,&quot; now 
                was always asking to go out.</p>
              <p> 　　In fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious 
                costume if one does not display them?</p>
              <p> 　　He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste 
                for the back garden.</p>
              <p> 　　Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade 
                back and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who 
                was shy, never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, 
                like a dog.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, 
                lost the grace of ignoring it.</p>
              <p> 　　An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is 
                ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent 
                creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise 
                without being conscious of it.</p>
              <p> 　　But what she had lost in ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive 
                and serious charm. Her whole person, permeated with the joy of 
                youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth a splendid 
                melancholy.</p>
              <p> 　　It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, 
                saw her once more at the Luxembourg.</p>

              <p> 　　 In the meantime, in the Marche Saint-Jean, where the post 
                had already been disarmed, Gavroche had just &quot;effected a 
                junction&quot; with a band led by Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, 
                and Feuilly. They were armed after a fashion.</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the 
                group.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the 
                gun of a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, and 
                in his belt, two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to 
                be seen, Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; 
                Courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, 
                with a naked sword in his hand, marched at their head shouting: 
                &quot;Long live Poland!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　They reached the Quai Morland.</p>
              <p> 　　Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked by the rain, with 
                lightning in their eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche accosted them calmly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where are we going?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come along,&quot; said Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was 
                like a fish in water in a riot.</p>
              <p> 　　He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in the sort of words 
                which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a passer-by, who 
                cried in bewilderment:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here are the reds!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The reds, the reds!&quot; retorted Bahorel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A queer kind of fear, bourgeois.</p>
              <p> 　　For my part I don't tremble before a poppy, the little red 
                hat inspires me with no alarm.</p>
              <p> 　　Take my advice, bourgeois, let's leave fear of the red to 
                horned cattle.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded 
                the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to 
                eat eggs, a Lenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris 
                to his &quot;flock.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;`Flock'; a polite way of saying geese.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And he tore the charge from the nail.</p>
              <p> 　　This conquered Gavroche. From that instant Gavroche set himself 
                to study Bahorel.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bahorel,&quot; observed Enjolras, &quot;you are wrong.</p>
              <p> 　　You should have let that charge alone, he is not the person 
                with whom we have to deal, you are wasting your wrath to no purpose.</p>
              <p> 　　Take care of your supply. One does not fire out of the ranks 
                with the soul any more than with a gun.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras,&quot; retorted 
                Bahorel. &quot;This bishop's prose shocks me; I want to eat eggs 
                without being permitted.</p>
              <p> 　　Your style is the hot and cold; I am amusing myself.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, I'm not wasting myself, I'm getting a start; and 
                if I tore down that charge, Hercle! 'twas only to whet my appetite.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This word, Hercle, struck Gavroche.</p>
              <p> 　　He sought all occasions for learning, and that tearer-down 
                of posters possessed his esteem. He inquired of him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What does Hercle mean?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bahorel answered:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with 
                a black beard who was watching them as they passed, probably a 
                Friend of the A B C. He shouted to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Quick, cartridges, para bellum.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A fine man! that's true,&quot; said Gavroche, who now 
                understood Latin.</p>
              <p> 　　A tumultuous retinue accompanied them,--students, artists, 
                young men affiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, 
                armed with clubs and bayonets; some, like Combeferre, with pistols 
                thrust into their trousers.</p>
              <p> 　　An old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking 
                in the band.</p>
              <p> 　　He had no arms, and he made great haste, so that he might 
                not be left behind, although he had a thoughtful air.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche caught sight of him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Keksekca?&quot; said he to Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He's an old duffer.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was M. Mabeuf.</p>

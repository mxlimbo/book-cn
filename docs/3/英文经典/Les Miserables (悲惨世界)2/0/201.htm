              <p> 　　 A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and 
                Montparnasse governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 
                to 1835.</p>
              <p> 　　Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position.</p>
              <p> 　　For his lair he had the sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was 
                six feet high, his pectoral muscles were of marble, his biceps 
                of brass, his breath was that of a cavern, his torso that of a 
                colossus, his head that of a bird.</p>
              <p> 　　One thought one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers 
                and a cotton velvet waistcoat.</p>
              <p> 　　Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might have 
                subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one.</p>
              <p> 　　A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age, but 
                with crow's-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard 
                like that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. 
                His muscles called for work, his stupidity would have none of 
                it. He was a great, idle force.</p>
              <p> 　　He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be 
                a creole.</p>
              <p> 　　He had, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having 
                been a porter at Avignon in 1815. After this stage, he had turned 
                ruffian.</p>
              <p> 　　The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of 
                Gueulemer. Babet was thin and learned.</p>
              <p> 　　He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight was visible 
                through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared that 
                he was a chemist.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been a jack of all trades. He had played in vaudeville 
                at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine talker, who underlined 
                his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His occupation consisted 
                in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and portraits of &quot;the 
                head of the State.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In addition to this, he extracted teeth.</p>
              <p> 　　He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth 
                with a trumpet and this poster: &quot;Babet, Dental Artist, Member 
                of the Academies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, 
                extracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners.</p>
              <p> 　　Price:</p>
              <p> 　　one tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; 
                three teeth, two francs, fifty.</p>
              <p> 　　Take advantage of this opportunity.&quot; This Take advantage 
                of this opportunity meant:</p>
              <p> 　　Have as many teeth extracted as possible.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been married and had had children. He did not know 
                what had become of his wife and children.</p>
              <p> 　　He had lost them as one loses his handkerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the world to 
                which he belonged.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, at the period when he had his family with him in 
                his booth on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a woman 
                had just given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a 
                calf's muzzle, and he exclaimed: &quot;There's a fortune! my wife 
                has not the wit to present me with a child like that!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to &quot;undertake 
                Paris.&quot; This was his expression.</p>
              <p> 　　Who was Claquesous?</p>
              <p> 　　He was night.</p>
              <p> 　　He waited until the sky was daubed with black, before he showed 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　At nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned 
                before daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　Where was this hole? No one knew.</p>
              <p> 　　He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness, 
                and with his back turned to them.</p>
              <p> 　　Was his name Claquesous? Certainly not.</p>
              <p> 　　If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.</p>
              <p> 　　Babet said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Claquesous was vague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure 
                whether he had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet; none was 
                sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke more frequently 
                than his voice; no one was sure that he had a face, as he was 
                never seen without his mask.</p>
              <p> 　　He disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air; when 
                he appeared, it was as though he sprang from the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　A lugubrious being was Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　Montparnasse was a child; less than twenty years of age, with 
                a handsome face, lips like cherries, charming black hair, the 
                brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had all vices and 
                aspired to all crimes.</p>
              <p> 　　The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the street boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket 
                turned garroter. He was genteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, 
                sluggish, ferocious. The rim of his hat was curled up on the left 
                side, in order to make room for a tuft of hair, after the style 
                of 1829.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived by robbery with violence.</p>
              <p> 　　His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse 
                was a fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders.</p>
              <p> 　　The cause of all this youth's crimes was the desire to be 
                well-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: &quot;You 
                are handsome!&quot; had cast the stain of darkness into his heart, 
                and had made a Cain of this Abel.</p>
              <p> 　　Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant:</p>
              <p> 　　now, the height of elegance is idleness; idleness in a poor 
                man means crime.</p>
              <p> 　　Few prowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse.</p>
              <p> 　　At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses in his past.</p>
              <p> 　　More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms in the 
                presence of this wretch, with his face in a pool of blood. Curled, 
                pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman, the bust of a 
                Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the boulevard 
                wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon 
                in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy 
                of the sepulchre.</p>

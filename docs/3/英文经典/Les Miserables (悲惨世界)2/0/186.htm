              <p> 　　MARIUS GROWN UP</p>
              <p> 　　 At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age.</p>
              <p> 　　It was three years since he had left his grandfather.</p>
              <p> 　　Both parties had remained on the same terms, without attempting 
                to approach each other, and without seeking to see each other.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the 
                iron pot.</p>
              <p> 　　We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's 
                heart. He had imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, 
                and that that crusty, harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, 
                shouted, and stormed and brandished his cane, cherished for him, 
                at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight and 
                severe, of the dotards of comedy.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their 
                children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.</p>
              <p> 　　At bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　He idolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment 
                of snappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, 
                he felt a black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention 
                the child to him, and all the while secretly regretted that he 
                was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, 
                this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return.</p>
              <p> 　　But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand's 
                great despair, the &quot;blood-drinker&quot; did not make his 
                appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I could not do otherwise than turn him out,&quot; said 
                the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: &quot;If the 
                thing were to do over again, would I do it?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His pride instantly answered &quot;yes,&quot; but his aged 
                head, which he shook in silence, replied sadly &quot;no.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is warmth.</p>
              <p> 　　Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought 
                some change in him.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step 
                towards &quot;that rogue&quot;; but he suffered. He never inquired 
                about him, but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the 
                Marais in a more and more retired manner; he was still merry and 
                violent as of old, but his merriment had a convulsive harshness, 
                and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy 
                dejection.</p>
              <p> 　　He sometimes said: &quot;Oh! if he only would return, what 
                a good box on the ear I would give him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius 
                was no longer for her much more than a vague black form; and she 
                eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with 
                the cat or the paroquet which she probably had.</p>
              <p> 　　What augmented Father Gillenormand's secret suffering was, 
                that he locked it all up within his breast, and did not allow 
                its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those recently 
                invented furnaces which consume their own smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　It sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him 
                of Marius, and asked him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is your grandson doing?&quot; &quot;What has become 
                of him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The old bourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, 
                and giving a fillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practising pettifogging 
                in some corner or other.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As 
                is the case with all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated 
                his bitterness.</p>
              <p> 　　He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but 
                he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man 
                who had been unkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation 
                of his first indignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, 
                and at suffering still. It was for his father's sake.</p>
              <p> 　　The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him.</p>
              <p> 　　He said to himself with a sort of joy that-- it was certainly 
                the least he could do; that it was an expiation;-- that, had it 
                not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way 
                and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, 
                and such a father! that it would not have been just that his father 
                should have all the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in 
                any case, what were his toils and his destitution compared with 
                the colonel's heroic life? that, in short, the only way for him 
                to approach his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the 
                face of indigence, as the other had been valiant before the enemy; 
                and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply 
                by the words: &quot;He will be worthy of it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast, since 
                the colonel's writing had disappeared, but in his heart.</p>
              <p> 　　And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out 
                of doors, he had been only a child, now he was a man.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt it.</p>
              <p> 　　Misery, we repeat, had been good for him.</p>
              <p> 　　Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has this magnificent property 
                about it, that it turns the whole will towards effort, and the 
                whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays material 
                life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible bounds towards 
                the ideal life.</p>
              <p> 　　The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, 
                horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and 
                all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side of the soul, 
                at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides.</p>
              <p> 　　The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; 
                when he has eaten, he has nothing more but meditation.</p>
              <p> 　　He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; he gazes 
                at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity 
                among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. 
                He gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes 
                upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God.</p>
              <p> 　　He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels 
                himself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes 
                to the compassion of the man who meditates.</p>
              <p> 　　An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness 
                of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments 
                which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand 
                open, and refuses to souls that are closed, he comes to pity, 
                he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money.</p>
              <p> 　　All hatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light 
                penetrates his spirit.</p>
              <p> 　　And is he unhappy? No. The misery of a young man is never 
                miserable.</p>
              <p> 　　The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he may 
                be, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant 
                eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, 
                his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy 
                of an aged emperor. And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh 
                to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands earn his 
                bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas.</p>
              <p> 　　His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, 
                to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, 
                on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head 
                in the light.</p>
              <p> 　　He is firm serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content 
                with little, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on 
                him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks:</p>
              <p> 　　work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes him dignified.</p>
              <p> 　　This is what had happened with Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　To tell the truth, he inclined a little too much to the side 
                of contemplation.</p>
              <p> 　　From the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with 
                some approach to certainty, he had stopped, thinking it good to 
                be poor, and retrenching time from his work to give to thought; 
                that is to say, he sometimes passed entire days in meditation, 
                absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute voluptuousness 
                of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded the problem 
                of his life:</p>
              <p> 　　to toil as little as possible at material labor, in order 
                to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable; 
                in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to cast 
                the rest to the infinite.</p>
              <p> 　　As he believed that he lacked nothing, he did not perceive 
                that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming one of the 
                forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering 
                the first necessities of life, and that he was resting from his 
                labors too soon.</p>
              <p> 　　It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, 
                this could only be a transitory state, and that, at the first 
                shock against the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius 
                would awaken.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father 
                Gillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, 
                he was not even pettifogging.</p>
              <p> 　　Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. To haunt attorneys, 
                to follow the court, to hunt up cases-- what a bore!</p>
              <p> 　　Why should he do it?</p>
              <p> 　　He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood!</p>
              <p> 　　The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had come 
                to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too 
                much labor, as we have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, 
                offered to take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to 
                furnish him with regular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred 
                francs a year.</p>
              <p> 　　To be well lodged!</p>
              <p> 　　Fifteen hundred francs!</p>
              <p> 　　No doubt. But renounce his liberty!</p>
              <p> 　　Be on fixed wages!</p>
              <p> 　　A sort of hired man of letters!</p>
              <p> 　　According to Marius' opinion, if he accepted, his position 
                would become both better and worse at the same time, he acquired 
                comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fine and complete unhappiness 
                converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture: something 
                like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one 
                eye.</p>
              <p> 　　He refused.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius dwelt in solitude.</p>
              <p> 　　Owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything, and 
                through having been too much alarmed, he had not entered decidedly 
                into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained good 
                friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every 
                possible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends:</p>
              <p> 　　one young, Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf.</p>
              <p> 　　He inclined more to the old man.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had 
                taken place within him; to him he was indebted for having known 
                and loved his father. &quot;He operated on me for a cataract,&quot; 
                he said.</p>
              <p> 　　The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but 
                the calm and impassive agent of Providence in this connection.</p>
              <p> 　　He had enlightened Marius by chance and without being aware 
                of the fact, as does a candle which some one brings; he had been 
                the candle and not the some one.</p>
              <p> 　　As for Marius' inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was 
                totally incapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　As we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will 
                not be superfluous.</p>

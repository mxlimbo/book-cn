              <p> 　　EFFECT OF THE SPRING</p>
              <p> 　　 One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with 
                light and shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had 
                washed it that morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little 
                twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown 
                open his whole soul to nature, he was not thinking of anything, 
                he simply lived and breathed, he passed near the bench, the young 
                girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.</p>
              <p> 　　What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion? 
                Marius could not have told.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing and there was everything. It was a strange 
                flash.</p>
              <p> 　　She dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.</p>
              <p> 　　What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple 
                eye of a child; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, 
                then abruptly closed again.</p>
              <p> 　　There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. 
                Woe to him who chances to be there!</p>
              <p> 　　That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, 
                is like the dawn in the sky.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the awakening of something radiant and strange.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected 
                gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable 
                shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, 
                and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided 
                tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, 
                and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a virgin looking like a woman.</p>
              <p> 　　It is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that 
                glance, where it falls.</p>
              <p> 　　All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal 
                gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of 
                coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming, 
                in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated 
                with perfume and with poison, which is called love.</p>
              <p> 　　That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his 
                eyes over his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that 
                he had been so slovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid 
                as to go for his walk in the Luxembourg with his &quot;every-day 
                clothes,&quot; that is to say, with a hat battered near the band, 
                coarse carter's boots, black trousers which showed white at the 
                knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows.</p>

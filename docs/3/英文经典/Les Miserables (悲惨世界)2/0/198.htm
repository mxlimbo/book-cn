              <p> 　　ECLIPSE</p>
              <p> 　　 The reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought 
                that he discovered, that She was named Ursule.</p>
              <p> 　　Appetite grows with loving.</p>
              <p> 　　To know that her name was Ursule was a great deal; it was 
                very little.</p>
              <p> 　　In three or four weeks, Marius had devoured this bliss.</p>
              <p> 　　He wanted another.</p>
              <p> 　　He wanted to know where she lived.</p>
              <p> 　　He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush 
                of the bench by the Gladiator.</p>
              <p> 　　He had committed a second, by not remaining at the Luxembourg 
                when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a third, 
                and an immense one.</p>
              <p> 　　He followed &quot;Ursule.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, in the most unfrequented 
                spot, in a new, three-story house, of modest appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing 
                her at the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.</p>
              <p> 　　His hunger was increasing.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew her first name, at least, a charming name, a genuine 
                woman's name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to know who she 
                was.</p>
              <p> 　　One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, 
                and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate, he entered 
                in their train and said boldly to the porter:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, 
                who has just come in?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; replied the porter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is the gentleman on the third floor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another step gained.</p>
              <p> 　　This success emboldened Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;On the front?&quot; he asked.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Parbleu!&quot; said the porter, &quot;the house is only 
                built on the street.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And what is that gentleman's business?&quot; began Marius 
                again.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is a gentleman of property, sir.</p>
              <p> 　　A very kind man who does good to the unfortunate, though not 
                rich himself.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is his name?&quot; resumed Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter raised his head and said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Are you a police spy, sir?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius went off quite abashed, but delighted.</p>
              <p> 　　He was getting on.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good,&quot; thought he, &quot;I know that her name is 
                Ursule, that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his 
                income, and that she lives there, on the third floor, in the Rue 
                de l'Ouest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only 
                a very brief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was 
                still broad daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest, as he had taken 
                up the habit of doing.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter 
                pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold, and 
                stared intently at Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius waited for them all day in vain.</p>
              <p> 　　At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l'Ouest, and saw a light 
                in the windows of the third story.</p>
              <p> 　　He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.</p>
              <p> 　　The next day, no one at the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius waited all day, then went and did sentinel duty under 
                their windows.</p>
              <p> 　　This carried him on to ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
              <p> 　　His dinner took care of itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Fever nourishes the sick man, and love the lover.</p>
              <p> 　　He spent a week in this manner.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the Luxembourg.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch 
                the porte cochere during the day; he contented himself with going 
                at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows.</p>
              <p> 　　At times he saw shadows flit across them, and his heart began 
                to beat.</p>
              <p> 　　On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there 
                was no light in them.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Hello!&quot; he said, &quot;the lamp is not lighted 
                yet.</p>
              <p> 　　But it is dark. Can they have gone out?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He waited until ten o'clock. Until midnight. Until one in 
                the morning.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story, and 
                no one entered the house.</p>
              <p> 　　He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.</p>
              <p> 　　On the morrow,--for he only existed from morrow to morrow, 
                there was, so to speak, no to-day for him,--on the morrow, he 
                found no one at the Luxembourg; he had expected this.</p>
              <p> 　　At dusk, he went to the house.</p>
              <p> 　　No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third 
                floor was totally dark.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius rapped at the porte cochere, entered, and said to the 
                porter:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The gentleman on the third floor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Has moved away,&quot; replied the porter.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius reeled and said feebly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How long ago?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yesterday.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is he living now?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know anything about it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So he has not left his new address?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come!</p>
              <p> 　　So it's you!&quot; said he; &quot;but you are decidedly a 
                spy then?&quot;</p>

              WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796
              <p>　　Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the 
                gunwas about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could 
                nothold out a quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessaryto 
                deaden the blows.</p>
              <p>　　Enjolras issued this command:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;We must place a mattress there.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;We have none,&quot; said Combeferre, &quot;the wounded 
                are lying on them.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the 
                cornerof the tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to 
                that moment,taken no part in anything that was going on. He did 
                not appearto hear the combatants saying around him: &quot;Here 
                is a gun that isdoing nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.</p>
              <p>　　It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in 
                the Ruede la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, 
                had placedher mattress in front of her window. This window, an 
                attic window,was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little 
                beyondthe barricade. The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported 
                atthe bottom on two poles for drying linen, was upheld at the 
                topby two ropes, which, at that distance, looked like two threads,and 
                which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames. 
                These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?&quot; 
                said Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p>　　Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.</p>
              <p>　　Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.</p>
              <p>　　One of the mattress ropes was cut.</p>
              <p>　　The mattress now hung by one thread only.</p>
              <p>　　Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashedthe 
                panes of the attic window. The mattress slipped betweenthe two 
                poles and fell into the street.</p>
              <p>　　The barricade applauded.</p>
              <p>　　All voices cried:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Here is a mattress!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Combeferre, &quot;but who will go and 
                fetch it?&quot;</p>
              <p>　　The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade,between 
                besiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeantof artillery 
                having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had,for several minutes, 
                been lying flat on their stomachs behindthe line of paving-stones 
                which they had erected, and, in orderto supply the forced silence 
                of the piece, which was quiet whileits service was in course of 
                reorganization, they had opened fireon the barricade. The insurgents 
                did not reply to this musketry,in order to spare their ammunition 
                The fusillade broke againstthe barricade; but the street, which 
                it filled, was terrible.</p>
              <p>　　Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street,traversed 
                the storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress,hoisted it upon 
                his back, and returned to the barricade.</p>
              <p>　　He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixedit 
                there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-menshould 
                not see it.</p>
              <p>　　That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.</p>
              <p>　　It was not long in coming.</p>
              <p>　　The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. 
                But there was no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen hadbeen 
                attained. The barricade was saved.</p>
              <p>　　&quot;Citizen,&quot; said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, &quot;the 
                Republic thanks you.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. 
                Triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning. 
                But never mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!&quot;</p>
              <p>　　</p>
              <p>　　CHAPTER X</p>
              <p>　　DAWN</p>
              <p>　　At that moment, Cosette awoke.</p>
              <p>　　Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,facing 
                the East on the back court-yard of the house.</p>
              <p>　　Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had 
                notbeen there on the preceding evening, and she had already retiredto 
                her chamber when Toussaint had said:</p>
              <p>　　&quot;It appears that there is a row.&quot;</p>
              <p>　　Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had hadsweet 
                dreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her littlebed 
                was very white. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to herin 
                the light. She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first,produced 
                on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first 
                thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette 
                felt herself thoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean,she had, 
                a few hours previously, passed through that reactionof the soul 
                which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish 
                hope, with all her might, without knowing why. Then she felt a 
                pang at her heart. It was three days since shehad seen Marius. 
                But she said to herself that he must have receivedher letter, 
                that he knew where she was, and that he was so cleverthat he would 
                find means of reaching her.--And that certainlyto-day, and perhaps 
                that very morning.--It was broad daylight,but the rays of light 
                were very horizontal; she thought that itwas very early, but that 
                she must rise, nevertheless, in order toreceive Marius.</p>
              <p>　　She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that,consequently, 
                that was sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was 
                valid. All this was certain. It was monstrous enoughalready to 
                have suffered for three days. Marius absent three days,this was 
                horrible on the part of the good God. Now, this cruelteasing from 
                on high had been gone through with. Marius was aboutto arrive, 
                and he would bring good news. Youth is made thus;it quickly dries 
                its eyes; it finds sorrow useless and does notaccept it. Youth 
                is the smile of the future in the presence of anunknown quantity, 
                which is itself. It is natural to it to be happy. It seems as 
                though its respiration were made of hope.</p>
              <p>　　Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to 
                heron the subject of this absence which was to last only one day,and 
                what explanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticedwith 
                what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rollsaway 
                and hides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. 
                There are thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle awayin 
                a corner of our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost;it 
                is impossible to lay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat 
                vexedat the useless little effort made by her memory. She told 
                herself,that it was very naughty and very wicked of her, to have 
                forgottenthe words uttered by Marius.</p>
              <p>　　She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of 
                souland body, her prayers and her toilet.</p>
              <p>　　One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader intoa 
                nuptial chamber, not into a virginal chamber. Verse wouldhardly 
                venture it, prose must not.</p>
              <p>　　It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it 
                iswhiteness in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily,which 
                must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has notgazed 
                upon it. Woman in the bud is sacred. That innocent budwhich opens, 
                that adorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself,that white 
                foot which takes refuge in a slipper, that throatwhich veils itself 
                before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye,that chemise which 
                makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulderfor a creaking 
                bit of furniture or a passing vehicle, those cords tied,those 
                clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those tremors, those shiversof 
                cold and modesty, that exquisite affright in every movement,that 
                almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm,the 
                successive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,--it 
                is not fitting that all this should be narrated, and it is too 
                muchto have even called attention to it.</p>
              <p>　　The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the 
                risingof a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a 
                star. The possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation 
                of respect. The down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the 
                radiated crystal ofthe snow, the wing of the butterfly powdered 
                with feathers, are coarsecompared to that chastity which does 
                not even know that it is chaste. The young girl is only the flash 
                of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber is hidden 
                in the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glance 
                brutalizes this vague penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.</p>
              <p>　　We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutterof 
                Cosette's rising.</p>
              <p>　　An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God,but 
                that Adam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and shewas ashamed 
                and turned crimson. We are of the number who fallspeechless in 
                the presence of young girls and flowers, since wethink them worthy 
                of veneration.</p>
              <p>　　Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her 
                hair,which was a very simple matter in those days, when women 
                did notswell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, 
                and didnot put crinoline in their locks. Then she opened the windowand 
                cast her eyes around her in every direction, hoping to descrysome 
                bit of the street, an angle of the house, an edge of pavement,so 
                that she might be able to watch for Marius there. But no viewof 
                the outside was to be had. The back court was surrounded bytolerably 
                high walls, and the outlook was only on several gardens. Cosette 
                pronounced these gardens hideous: for the first timein her life, 
                she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of thegutter of the 
                street would have met her wishes better. She decidedto gaze at 
                the sky, as though she thought that Marius might comefrom that 
                quarter.</p>
              <p>　　All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was ficklenessof 
                soul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection--that was her case. 
                She had a confused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts 
                wererife in the air, in fact. She told herself that she was not 
                sureof anything, that to withdraw herself from sight was to be 
                lost;and the idea that Marius could return to her from heaven 
                appearedto her no longer charming but mournful.</p>
              <p>　　Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her,and 
                hope and a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trustin 
                God.</p>
              <p>　　Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence 
                reigned. Not a shutter had been opened. The porter's lodge was 
                closed. Toussaint had not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought 
                that herfather was asleep. She must have suffered much, and she 
                must havestill been suffering greatly, for she said to herself, 
                that herfather had been unkind; but she counted on Marius. The 
                eclipseof such a light was decidedly impossible. Now and then, 
                she heardsharp shocks in the distance, and she said: &quot;It 
                is odd that peopleshould be opening and shutting their carriage 
                gates so early.&quot; They were the reports of the cannon battering 
                the barricade.</p>
              <p>　　A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectlyblack 
                cornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curveof this 
                nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice,so that from 
                above it was possible to look into this little paradise. The mother 
                was there, spreading her wings like a fan over her brood;the father 
                fluttered about, flew away, then came back, bearing inhis beak 
                food and kisses. The dawning day gilded this happy thing,the great 
                law, &quot;Multiply,&quot; lay there smiling and august, and that 
                sweetmystery unfolded in the glory of the morning. Cosette, with 
                her hairin the sunlight, her soul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated 
                by lovewithin and by the dawn without, bent over mechanically, 
                and almostwithout daring to avow to herself that she was thinking 
                at the sametime of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at this 
                family,at that male and female, that mother and her little ones,with 
                the profound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin.</p>

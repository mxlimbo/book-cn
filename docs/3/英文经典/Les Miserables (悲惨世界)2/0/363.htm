              <p> 　　ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION</p>
              <p> 　　 During the last months of spring and the first months of 
                summer in 1833, the rare passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, 
                the loungers on thresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in 
                black, who emerged every day at the same hour, towards nightfall, 
                from the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, 
                passed in front of the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, 
                and, on arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, 
                and entered the Rue Saint-Louis.</p>
              <p> 　　There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, 
                seeing nothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a 
                point which seemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and 
                which was no other than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. 
                The nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his 
                eye lighted up; a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward 
                aurora, he had a fascinated and much affected air, his lips indulged 
                in obscure movements, as though he were talking to some one whom 
                he did not see, he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible. 
                One would have said that, while desirous of reaching his destination, 
                he feared the moment when he should be close at hand.</p>
              <p> 　　When only a few houses remained between him and that street 
                which appeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree 
                that, at times, one might have thought that he was no longer advancing 
                at all. The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs 
                suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole. 
                Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to arrive at 
                last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, 
                he trembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity 
                round the corner of the last house, and gazed into that street, 
                and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the 
                dazzling light of the impossible, and the reflection from a paradise 
                that was closed to him.</p>
              <p> 　　Then a tear, which had slowly gathered in the corner of his 
                lids, and had become large enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, 
                and sometimes stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its bitter 
                flavor.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone, 
                then he returned by the same road and with the same step, and, 
                in proportion as he retreated, his glance died out.</p>
              <p> 　　Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the 
                corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in 
                the Rue Saint-Louis; sometimes a little further off, sometimes 
                a little nearer.</p>
              <p> 　　One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine 
                and looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. 
                Then he shook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing 
                himself something, and retraced his steps.</p>
              <p> 　　Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got 
                as far as the Rue Pavee, shook his head and turned back; then 
                he went no further than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did 
                not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he 
                was a pendulum which was no longer wound up, and whose oscillations 
                were growing shorter before ceasing altogether.</p>
              <p> 　　Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook 
                the same trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without 
                himself being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His 
                whole countenance expressed this single idea:</p>
              <p> 　　What is the use?-- His eye was dim; no more radiance.</p>
              <p> 　　His tears were also exhausted; they no longer collected in 
                the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved 
                at times; the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. 
                Sometimes, when the weather was bad, he had an umbrella under 
                his arm, but he never opened it.</p>
              <p> 　　The good women of the quarter said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is an innocent.&quot; The children followed him and 
                laughed.</p>

              <p> 　　THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN</p>
              <p> 　　 Marius was quite upset.</p>
              <p> 　　The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards 
                the man beside whom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to 
                him. There was something enigmatic about that person, of which 
                his instinct had warned him.</p>
              <p> 　　This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. 
                This M. Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness 
                resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.</p>
              <p> 　　Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned 
                to such a neighborhood?</p>
              <p> 　　Was this an accomplished fact?</p>
              <p> 　　Did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage 
                now consummated? Was there nothing to be done?</p>
              <p> 　　Had Marius wedded the convict as well?</p>
              <p> 　　In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may 
                one taste the grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks 
                would force even the archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod 
                in his glory, to shudder.</p>
              <p> 　　As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius 
                asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. 
                Had he been wanting in divination?</p>
              <p> 　　Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he involuntarily dulled 
                his wits?</p>
              <p> 　　A little, perhaps.</p>
              <p> 　　Had he entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his 
                marriage to Cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to 
                throw light upon the surroundings?</p>
              <p> 　　He admitted,--it is thus, by a series of successive admissions 
                of ourselves in regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little 
                by little,--he admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his 
                nature, a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations, 
                and which, in paroxysms of passion and sorrow, dilates as the 
                temperature of the soul changes, and invades the entire man, to 
                such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience 
                bathed in a mist.</p>
              <p> 　　We have more than once indicated this characteristic element 
                of Marius' individuality.</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the 
                Rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not 
                even spoke to Cosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where 
                the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during 
                the struggle and the ensuing flight.</p>
              <p> 　　How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette?</p>
              <p> 　　Yet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass 
                that he had not even named the Thenardiers, and, particularly, 
                on the day when he had encountered Eponine? He now found it almost 
                difficult to explain his silence of that time. Nevertheless, he 
                could account for it.</p>
              <p> 　　He recalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, 
                love absorbing everything, that catching away of each other into 
                the ideal, and perhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of 
                reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul, 
                a vague, dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in 
                his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which he dreaded, 
                in which he did not wish to play any part, his agency in which 
                he had kept secret, and in which he could be neither narrator 
                nor witness without being an accuser.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there 
                had been no time for anything except love.</p>
              <p> 　　In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over 
                in his mind, examined everything, whatever might have been the 
                consequences if he had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, 
                even if he had discovered that Jean Valjean was a convict, would 
                that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette?</p>
              <p> 　　Would he have drawn back? Would he have adored her any the 
                less?</p>
              <p> 　　Would he have refrained from marrying her?</p>
              <p> 　　No. Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he 
                need reproach himself.</p>
              <p> 　　All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are 
                called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would 
                have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight.</p>
              <p> 　　Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?</p>
              <p> 　　To paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal 
                accompaniment.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this 
                Fauchelevent who had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present 
                mingled with horror.</p>
              <p> 　　In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even 
                a certain surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored 
                that deposit.</p>
              <p> 　　And what a deposit!</p>
              <p> 　　Six hundred thousand francs.</p>
              <p> 　　He alone was in the secret of that deposit.</p>
              <p> 　　He might have kept it all, he had restored it all.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing forced him to this.</p>
              <p> 　　If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In 
                this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, 
                there was acceptance of peril.</p>
              <p> 　　For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it is a shelter.</p>
              <p> 　　A false name is security, and he had rejected that false name.</p>
              <p> 　　He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in 
                an honest family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what 
                motive?</p>
              <p> 　　Through a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this 
                with the irresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this 
                Jean Valjean might be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which 
                was awakening.</p>
              <p> 　　There existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; 
                and, to all appearances, scruples had for a long time already 
                controlled this man.</p>
              <p> 　　Such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of 
                vulgar natures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was sincere.</p>
              <p> 　　This sincerity, visible, palpable, irrefragable, evident from 
                the very grief that it caused him, rendered inquiries useless, 
                and conferred authority on all that that man had said.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. 
                What breathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust.</p>
              <p> 　　What did Jean Valjean inspire? confidence.</p>
              <p> 　　In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive 
                Marius struck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the 
                passive principle, and he tried to reach a balance.</p>
              <p> 　　But all this went on as in a storm.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man, 
                and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, in the depths of 
                his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.</p>
              <p> 　　The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession-- 
                these were good.</p>
              <p> 　　This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became 
                black once more.</p>
              <p> 　　Troubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned 
                to him.</p>
              <p> 　　After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? 
                Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, 
                instead of entering a complaint?</p>
              <p> 　　Here Marius found the answer.</p>
              <p> 　　Because that man was a fugitive from justice, who had broken 
                his ban.</p>
              <p> 　　Another question:</p>
              <p> 　　Why had that man come to the barricade?</p>
              <p> 　　For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection 
                which had re-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at 
                the application of heat.</p>
              <p> 　　This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there.</p>
              <p> 　　What had he come there for?</p>
              <p> 　　In the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Javert.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean 
                Valjean dragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and 
                he still heard behind the corner of the little Rue Mondetour that 
                frightful pistol shot.</p>
              <p> 　　Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and the 
                galley-slave. The one was in the other's way.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of 
                revenging himself. He had arrived late.</p>
              <p> 　　He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican 
                vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become 
                the law there; it is so simple that it does not astonish souls 
                which are but half turned towards good; and those hearts are so 
                constituted that a criminal, who is in the path of repentance, 
                may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the 
                matter of vengeance.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had killed Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　At least, that seemed to be evident.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there 
                was no reply.</p>
              <p> 　　This question Marius felt like pincers.</p>
              <p> 　　How had it come to pass that Jean Valjean's existence had 
                elbowed that of Cosette for so long a period?</p>
              <p> 　　What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed 
                that child in contact with that man?</p>
              <p> 　　Are there then chains for two which are forged on high? and 
                does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon?</p>
              <p> 　　So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious 
                galleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons 
                which is called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, 
                the one ingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in 
                the divine whiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the 
                flash of an eternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable 
                pairing off?</p>
              <p> 　　In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community 
                of life been established between this celestial little creature 
                and that old criminal?</p>
              <p> 　　Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still 
                more incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For 
                the wolf loved the lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble 
                one, for, during the space of nine years, the angel had had the 
                monster as her point of support.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette's childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight, 
                her virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered 
                by that hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, 
                into innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, 
                and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming 
                dizzy.</p>
              <p> 　　What was this man-precipice?</p>
              <p> 　　The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, 
                such as it now exists, and until a broader day shall effect a 
                change in it, there will always be two men, the one superior, 
                the other subterranean; the one which is according to good is 
                Abel; the other which is according to evil is Cain.</p>
              <p> 　　What was this tender Cain?</p>
              <p> 　　What was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration 
                of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying 
                her, and enveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity?</p>
              <p> 　　What was that cess-pool which had venerated that innocence 
                to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot?</p>
              <p> 　　What was this Jean Valjean educating Cosette?</p>
              <p> 　　What was this figure of the shadows which had for its only 
                object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow 
                and from every cloud?</p>
              <p> 　　That was Jean Valjean's secret; that was also God's secret.</p>
              <p> 　　In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled.</p>
              <p> 　　The one, in some sort, reassured him as to the other.</p>
              <p> 　　God was as visible in this affair as was Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool which he 
                wills.</p>
              <p> 　　He is not responsible to men.</p>
              <p> 　　Do we know how God sets about the work?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　He had, to some extent, made that soul. That was incontestable.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, what then?</p>
              <p> 　　The workman was horrible; but the work was admirable.</p>
              <p> 　　God produces his miracles as seems good to him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had constructed that charming Cosette, and he had employed 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　It had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for 
                himself.</p>
              <p> 　　What account have we to demand of him? Is this the first time 
                that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create the rose?</p>
              <p> 　　Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself 
                that they were good.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points which 
                we have just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that 
                he did not dare to do it.</p>
              <p> 　　He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette was splendidly 
                pure.</p>
              <p> 　　That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment did he need?</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette was a light.</p>
              <p> 　　Does light require enlightenment?</p>
              <p> 　　He had everything; what more could he desire?</p>
              <p> 　　All,-- is not that enough?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's personal affairs did not concern him.</p>
              <p> 　　And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast, 
                convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: 
                &quot;I am nothing to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Ten years ago I did not know that she was in existence.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, 
                he had passed.</p>
              <p> 　　Whatever he was, his part was finished.</p>
              <p> 　　Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence 
                to Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in 
                her lover, her husband, her celestial male.</p>
              <p> 　　Cosette, as she took her flight, winged and transfigured, 
                left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis, 
                Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned 
                to a certain horror for Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we have just pointed out, 
                he felt a quid divinum in that man. But do what he would, and 
                seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to fall 
                back upon this:</p>
              <p> 　　the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who has not 
                even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the 
                very lowest rung.</p>
              <p> 　　After the very last of men comes the convict.</p>
              <p> 　　The convict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of 
                the living.</p>
              <p> 　　The law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity 
                of which it can deprive a man.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, 
                though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the 
                law on the subject of those whom the law strikes.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not yet accomplished all progress, we admit.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written 
                by man and that which is written by God, between law and right.</p>
              <p> 　　He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes 
                to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not 
                shocked by the word vindicte.</p>
              <p> 　　He found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written 
                law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted, 
                as the process of civilization, social damnation.</p>
              <p> 　　He still stood at this point, though safe to advance infallibly 
                later on, since his nature was good, and, at bottom, wholly formed 
                of latent progress.</p>
              <p> 　　In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous 
                and repulsive.</p>
              <p> 　　He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was for 
                him like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after 
                having reflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final 
                gesture had been to turn away his head. Vade retro.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, 
                while interrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean 
                had said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are confessing me,&quot; had not, nevertheless, 
                put to him two or three decisive questions.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, 
                but that he had been afraid of them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Jondrette attic? The barricade?</p>
              <p> 　　Javert?</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows where these revelations would have stopped?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back, 
                and who knows whether Marius, after having urged him on, would 
                not have himself desired to hold him back?</p>
              <p> 　　Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, 
                to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after 
                we have asked a question?</p>
              <p> 　　It is especially when one loves that one gives way to these 
                exhibitions of cowardice.</p>
              <p> 　　It is not wise to question sinister situations to the last 
                point, particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is 
                fatally intermingled with them.</p>
              <p> 　　What a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing 
                explanations of Jean Valjean, and who knows whether that hideous 
                glare would not have darted forth as far as Cosette?</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered 
                behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of a lightning-flash 
                is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncture where 
                innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the 
                reflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve 
                the reflection of a horrible association.</p>
              <p> 　　Rightly or wrongly, Marius had been afraid. He already knew 
                too much.</p>
              <p> 　　He sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light.</p>
              <p> 　　In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes 
                to Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How 
                should he dare to seek the bottom of it?</p>
              <p> 　　It is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow.</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackened 
                forever by it.</p>
              <p> 　　In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, 
                come into any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending 
                perplexity to Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　He now almost reproached himself for not having put those 
                formidable questions, before which he had recoiled, and from which 
                an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung. He felt 
                that he was too good, too gentle, too weak, if we must say the 
                word.</p>
              <p> 　　This weakness had led him to an imprudent concession. He had 
                allowed himself to be touched.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely 
                rejected Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that is what he 
                should have done, and have freed his house from that man.</p>
              <p> 　　He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind 
                of emotions which had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. 
                He was displeased with himself.</p>
              <p> 　　What was he to do now?</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant to him.</p>
              <p> 　　What was the use in having that man in his house?</p>
              <p> 　　What did the man want?</p>
              <p> 　　Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he 
                did not wish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. 
                He had promised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; 
                Jean Valjean held his promise; one must keep one's word even to 
                a convict, above all to a convict.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short, he was carried 
                away by the repugnance which dominated him.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, 
                passing from one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence 
                arose a profound trouble.</p>
              <p> 　　It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, 
                but love is a talent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.</p>
              <p> 　　However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, 
                who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; 
                he talked of her childhood and her youth, and he became more and 
                more convinced that that convict had been everything good, paternal 
                and respectable that a man can be towards Cosette. All that Marius 
                had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real. That sinister 
                nettle had loved and protected that lily.<br>

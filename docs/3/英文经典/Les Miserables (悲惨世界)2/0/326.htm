              <p> 　　Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water.</p>
              <p> 　　And this without metaphor.</p>
              <p> 　　How, and in what manner?</p>
              <p> 　　Day and night. With what object?</p>
              <p> 　　With no object.</p>
              <p> 　　With what intention? With no intention.</p>
              <p> 　　Why?</p>
              <p> 　　For no reason.</p>
              <p> 　　By means of what organ? By means of its intestine.</p>
              <p> 　　What is its intestine?</p>
              <p> 　　The sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure 
                which the valuations of special science have set upon it.</p>
              <p> 　　Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the 
                most fecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human 
                manure. The Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before 
                us. Not a Chinese peasant--it is Eckberg who says this,--goes 
                to town without bringing back with him, at the two extremities 
                of his bamboo pole, two full buckets of what we designate as filth.</p>
              <p> 　　Thanks to human dung, the earth in China is still as young 
                as in the days of Abraham. Chinese wheat yields a hundred fold 
                of the seed.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no guano comparable in fertility with the detritus 
                of a capital. A great city is the most mighty of dung-makers. 
                Certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city 
                to manure the plain.</p>
              <p> 　　If our gold is manure, our manure, on the other hand, is gold.</p>
              <p> 　　What is done with this golden manure?</p>
              <p> 　　It is swept into the abyss.</p>
              <p> 　　Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect 
                the dung of petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable 
                element of opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. 
                All the human and animal manure which the world wastes, restored 
                to the land instead of being cast into the water, would suffice 
                to nourish the world.</p>
              <p> 　　Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of 
                mud which jolt through the street by night, those terrible casks 
                of the street department, those fetid drippings of subterranean 
                mire, which the pavements hide from you,--do you know what they 
                are? They are the meadow in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, 
                thyme and sage, they are game, they are cattle, they are the satisfied 
                bellows of great oxen in the evening, they are perfumed hay, they 
                are golden wheat, they are the bread on your table, they are the 
                warm blood in your veins, they are health, they are joy, they 
                are life. This is the will of that mysterious creation which is 
                transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven.</p>
              <p> 　　Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow 
                forth from it.</p>
              <p> 　　The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.</p>
              <p> 　　You have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider 
                me ridiculous to boot.</p>
              <p> 　　This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.</p>
              <p> 　　Statisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit 
                of half a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths 
                of her rivers.</p>
              <p> 　　Note this:</p>
              <p> 　　with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter of the 
                expenses of our budget.</p>
              <p> 　　The cleverness of man is such that he prefers to get rid of 
                these five hundred millions in the gutter.</p>
              <p> 　　It is the very substance of the people that is carried off, 
                here drop by drop, there wave after wave, the wretched outpour 
                of our sewers into the rivers, and the gigantic collection of 
                our rivers into the ocean.</p>
              <p> 　　Every hiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs.</p>
              <p> 　　From this spring two results, the land impoverished, and the 
                water tainted.</p>
              <p> 　　Hunger arising from the furrow, and disease from the stream.</p>
              <p> 　　It is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the 
                Thames is poisoning London.</p>
              <p> 　　So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable 
                of late, to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below 
                the last bridge.</p>
              <p> 　　A double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, 
                sucking up and driving back, a system of elementary drainage, 
                simple as the lungs of a man, and which is already in full working 
                order in many communities in England, would suffice to conduct 
                the pure water of the fields into our cities, and to send back 
                to the fields the rich water of the cities, and this easy exchange, 
                the simplest in the world, would retain among us the five hundred 
                millions now thrown away.</p>
              <p> 　　People are thinking of other things.</p>
              <p> 　　The process actually in use does evil, with the intention 
                of doing good. The intention is good, the result is melancholy.</p>
              <p> 　　Thinking to purge the city, the population is blanched like 
                plants raised in cellars. A sewer is a mistake.</p>
              <p> 　　When drainage, everywhere, with its double function, restoring 
                what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is a simple 
                impoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the data 
                of a now social economy, the product of the earth will be increased 
                tenfold, and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened.</p>
              <p> 　　Add the suppression of parasitism, and it will be solved.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, 
                and leakage takes place.</p>
              <p> 　　Leakage is the word.</p>
              <p> 　　Europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion.</p>
              <p> 　　As for France, we have just cited its figures.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, Paris contains one twenty-fifth of the total population 
                of France, and Parisian guano being the richest of all, we understate 
                the truth when we value the loss on the part of Paris at twenty-five 
                millions in the half milliard which France annually rejects.</p>
              <p> 　　These twenty-five millions, employed in assistance and enjoyment, 
                would double the splendor of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　The city spends them in sewers.</p>
              <p> 　　So that we may say that Paris's great prodigality, its wonderful 
                festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its stream of gold from 
                full hands, its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence, is its sewer 
                system.</p>
              <p> 　　It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political 
                economy, we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost 
                in the gulfs the well-being of all.</p>
              <p> 　　There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the public fortune.</p>
              <p> 　　Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: 
                Paris is a spendthrift.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged capitals, 
                of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that metropolis 
                of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of impulse 
                and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that nation-city, 
                that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of Babylon 
                and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders, 
                from the point of view which we have just indicated.</p>
              <p> 　　Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless 
                waste, Paris is itself an imitator.</p>
              <p> 　　These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this 
                is no young folly.</p>
              <p> 　　The ancients did like the moderns. &quot;The sewers of Rome,&quot; 
                says Liebig, &quot;have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman 
                peasant.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome 
                exhausted Italy, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she 
                poured in Sicily, then Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome 
                has engulfed the world.</p>
              <p> 　　This cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the 
                universe.</p>
              <p> 　　Urbi et orbi. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.</p>
              <p> 　　Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar 
                to intelligent towns.</p>
              <p> 　　For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of 
                which we have just explained our views, Paris has beneath it another 
                Paris; a Paris of sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, 
                its squares, its blind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, 
                which is of mire and minus the human form.</p>
              <p> 　　For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where 
                there is everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; 
                and, if Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city 
                of might, Sparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, 
                it also contains Lutetia, the city of mud.</p>
              <p> 　　However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic 
                sink of Paris realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized 
                in humanity by some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, 
                grandiose vileness.</p>
              <p> 　　The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, 
                would present the aspect of a colossal madrepore.</p>
              <p> 　　A sponge has no more partitions and ducts than the mound of 
                earth for a circuit of six leagues round about, on which rests 
                the great and ancient city. Not to mention its catacombs, which 
                are a separate cellar, not to mention the inextricable trellis-work 
                of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast tubular system for the 
                distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains, 
                the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work under the 
                two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread.</p>
              <p> 　　There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the 
                product to which Paris has given birth.</p>

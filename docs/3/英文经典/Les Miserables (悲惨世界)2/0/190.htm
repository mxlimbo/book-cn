              <p> 　　THE SOBRIQUET:</p>
              <p> 　　MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES <br>
                Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, 
                with thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow, 
                well-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity, 
                and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent 
                over his whole countenance.</p>
              <p> 　　His profile, all of whose lines were rounded, without thereby 
                losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness, which 
                has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace 
                and Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which rendered 
                the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which 
                distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that 
                period of life when the mind of men who think is composed, in 
                nearly equal parts, of depth and ingenuousness. A grave situation 
                being given, he had all that is required to be stupid:</p>
              <p> 　　one more turn of the key, and he might be sublime. His manners 
                were reserved, cold, polished, not very genial. As his mouth was 
                charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeth the whitest in the 
                world, his smile corrected the severity of his face, as a whole.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous smile 
                presented a singular contrast.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were small, but his glance was large.</p>
              <p> 　　At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that 
                young girls turned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, 
                with death in his soul.</p>
              <p> 　　He thought that they were staring at him because of his old 
                clothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that 
                they stared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed 
                of him.</p>
              <p> 　　This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by 
                had made him shy.</p>
              <p> 　　He chose none of them for the excellent reason that he fled 
                from all of them.</p>
              <p> 　　He lived thus indefinitely,-- stupidly, as Courfeyrac said.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac also said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do not aspire to be venerable&quot; [they called each 
                other thou; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip 
                into this mode of address]. &quot;Let me give you a piece of advice, 
                my dear fellow.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't read so many books, and look a little more at the lasses.</p>
              <p> 　　The jades have some good points about them, O Marius!</p>
              <p> 　　By dint of fleeing and blushing, you will become brutalized.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:--&quot;Good 
                morning, Monsieur l'Abbe!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, 
                Marius avoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a 
                week to come, and he avoided Courfeyrac to boot.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, 
                two women whom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention 
                whatever. In truth, he would have been very much amazed if he 
                had been informed that they were women.</p>
              <p> 　　One was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber, and 
                caused Courfeyrac to say:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Seeing that his servant woman wears his beard, Marius 
                does not wear his own beard.&quot; The other was a sort of little 
                girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.</p>
              <p> 　　For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks 
                of the Luxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pepiniere, 
                a man and a very young girl, who were almost always seated side 
                by side on the same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, 
                on the Rue de l'Ouest side.</p>
              <p> 　　Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls 
                of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,--and 
                it was nearly every day,--he found this couple there.</p>
              <p> 　　The man appeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed 
                sad and serious; his whole person presented the robust and weary 
                aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service.</p>
              <p> 　　If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: &quot;He 
                is an ex-officer.&quot; He had a kindly but unapproachable air, 
                and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He 
                wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, 
                which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, 
                that is to say, it was dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen.</p>
              <p> 　　A grisette who passed near him one day, said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here's a very tidy widower.&quot; His hair was very 
                white.</p>
              <p> 　　The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came 
                and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, 
                she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so 
                thin as to be almost homely, awkward, insignificant, and with 
                a possible promise of handsome eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance.</p>
              <p> 　　Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the 
                scholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black 
                merino.</p>
              <p> 　　They had the air of being father and daughter.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this 
                little girl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter 
                paid no attention to them.</p>
              <p> 　　They, on their side, did not appear even to see him. They 
                conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air.</p>
              <p> 　　The girl chattered incessantly and merrily.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man talked but little, and, at times, he fixed on 
                her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that 
                walk. He invariably found them there.</p>
              <p> 　　This is the way things went:--</p>
              <p> 　　Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest 
                from their bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed 
                in front of them, then returned to the extremity whence he had 
                come, and began again.</p>
              <p> 　　This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade, 
                and the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without 
                its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting.</p>
              <p> 　　That personage, and that young girl, although they appeared,--and 
                perhaps because they appeared,-- to shun all glances, had, naturally, 
                caused some attention on the part of the five or six students 
                who strolled along the Pepiniere from time to time; the studious 
                after their lectures, the others after their game of billiards.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac, who was among the last, had observed them several 
                times, but, finding the girl homely, he had speedily and carefully 
                kept out of the way.</p>
              <p> 　　He had fled, discharging at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian 
                dart. Impressed solely with the child's gown and the old man's 
                hair, he had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the 
                father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as no one knew them under any 
                other title, this nickname became a law in the default of any 
                other name. The students said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　Monsieur Leblanc is on his bench.&quot; And Marius, like the 
                rest, had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman Monsieur 
                Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, 
                in order to facilitate this tale.</p>
              <p> 　　So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during 
                the first year.</p>
              <p> 　　He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.</p>

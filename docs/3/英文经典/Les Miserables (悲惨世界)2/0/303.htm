                OF THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE</p>
              <p> 　　The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social 
                maladies can name do not belong to the period in which the action 
                of this work is laid.</p>
              <p> 　　These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two different 
                aspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at 
                the time of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest 
                war of the streets that history has ever beheld.</p>
              <p> 　　It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even 
                contrary to liberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to 
                the universal vote, even contrary to the government, by all for 
                all, from the depths of its anguish, of its discouragements and 
                its destitutions, of its fevers, of its distresses, of its miasmas, 
                of its ignorances, of its darkness, that great and despairing 
                body, the rabble, protests against, and that the populace wages 
                battle against, the people.</p>
              <p> 　　Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against 
                demos.</p>
              <p> 　　These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount 
                of night even in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, 
                and those words which are intended to be insults-- beggars, canaille, 
                ochlocracy, populace--exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those 
                who reign than the fault of those who suffer; rather the fault 
                of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited.</p>
              <p> 　　For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain 
                and without respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to 
                which they correspond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these 
                miseries. Athens was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making 
                of Holland; the populace saved Rome more than once; and the rabble 
                followed Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the 
                magnificences of the lower classes.</p>
              <p> 　　It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, 
                and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these 
                miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when 
                he uttered this mysterious saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fex urbis, lex orbis,&quot;-- the dregs of the city, 
                the law of the earth.</p>
              <p> 　　The exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, 
                its violences contrary to all sense, directed against the principles 
                which are its life, its masterful deeds against the right, are 
                its popular coups d'etat and should be repressed.</p>
              <p> 　　The man of probity sacrifices himself, and out of his very 
                love for this crowd, he combats it.</p>
              <p> 　　But how excusable he feels it even while holding out against 
                it!</p>
              <p> 　　How he venerates it even while resisting it! This is one of 
                those rare moments when, while doing that which it is one's duty 
                to do, one feels something which disconcerts one, and which would 
                dissuade one from proceeding further; one persists, it is necessary, 
                but conscience, though satisfied, is sad, and the accomplishment 
                of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart.</p>
              <p> 　　June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, 
                and almost impossible of classification, in the philosophy of 
                history. All the words which we have just uttered, must be discarded, 
                when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt, in which 
                one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights.</p>
              <p> 　　It was necessary to combat it, and this was a duty, for it 
                attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848, at bottom?</p>
              <p> 　　A revolt of the people against itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; 
                may we, then, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for 
                a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have 
                just spoken and which characterized this insurrection.</p>
              <p> 　　One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the 
                other defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before 
                whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves 
                beneath the brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.</p>
              <p> 　　The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories 
                high, and seven hundred feet wide.</p>
              <p> 　　It barred the vast opening of the faubourg, that is to say, 
                three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, 
                crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with piles that were 
                bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there, powerfully 
                backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg, 
                it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable 
                place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades were 
                ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets behind 
                this principal barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　At the very sight of it, one felt the agonizing suffering 
                in the immense faubourg, which had reached that point of extremity 
                when a distress may become a catastrophe.</p>
              <p> 　　Of what was that barricade made?</p>
              <p> 　　Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, 
                said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others.</p>
              <p> 　　It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, 
                ruin.</p>
              <p> 　　It might be asked: Who built this?</p>
              <p> 　　It might also be said:</p>
              <p> 　　Who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of the ebullition.</p>
              <p> 　　Hold! take this door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! 
                this broken brazier! this cracked pot!</p>
              <p> 　　Give all! cast away all! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, 
                ruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the 
                block of stone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, 
                the broken pane, the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, 
                the rag, and the malediction.</p>
              <p> 　　It was grand and it was petty.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub.</p>
              <p> 　　The mass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall and the 
                broken bowl,--threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish.</p>
              <p> 　　Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd.</p>
              <p> 　　Terrible, in short.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the acropolis of the barefooted.</p>
              <p> 　　Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense 
                dray was spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, 
                and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade; an omnibus hoisted 
                gayly, by main force, to the very summit of the heap, as though 
                the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch 
                of the street urchin humor to their terror, presented its horseless, 
                unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air.</p>
              <p> 　　This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt, figured to 
                the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89, the 
                9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on 
                the 11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The 
                situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to 
                figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If 
                the ocean made dikes, it is thus that it would build. The fury 
                of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass. What flood?</p>
              <p> 　　The crowd.</p>
              <p> 　　One thought one beheld hubbub petrified. One thought one heard 
                humming above this barricade as though there had been over their 
                hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. Was it a thicket?</p>
              <p> 　　Was it a bacchanalia?</p>
              <p> 　　Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with 
                blows of its wings. There was something of the cess-pool in that 
                redoubt and something Olympian in that confusion.</p>
              <p> 　　One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the rafters 
                of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper, window 
                sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the 
                cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling 
                topsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the 
                very refuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury 
                and nothingness.</p>
              <p> 　　One would have said that it was the tatters of a people, rags 
                of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint 
                Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish 
                of the broom making of its misery its barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Blocks resembling headsman's blocks, dislocated chains, pieces 
                of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets, horizontal 
                wheels projecting from the rubbish, amalgamated with this edifice 
                of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the 
                people.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade Saint Antoine converted everything into a weapon; 
                everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded 
                thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm; the carbines which 
                defended this redoubt, among which there were some blunderbusses, 
                sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the casters 
                from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of the brass.</p>
              <p> 　　This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible 
                clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, it was covered 
                with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads 
                crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, 
                of sabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast 
                red flag flapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, 
                the roll of drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter 
                from the starving were to be heard there.</p>
              <p> 　　It was huge and living, and, like the back of an electric 
                beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. The 
                spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where 
                rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of 
                God; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. 
                It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.</p>
              <p> 　　As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the 
                revolution--what?</p>
              <p> 　　The revolution.</p>
              <p> 　　It--that barricade, chance, hazard, disorder, terror, misunderstanding, 
                the unknown-- had facing it the Constituent Assembly, the sovereignty 
                of the people, universal suffrage, the nation, the republic; and 
                it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise.</p>
              <p> 　　Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.</p>
              <p> 　　The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance.</p>
              <p> 　　The faubourg shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its 
                stand under cover of the faubourg.</p>
              <p> 　　The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the 
                strategy of the African generals dashed itself.</p>
              <p> 　　Its caverns, its excrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, 
                grimaced, so to speak, and grinned beneath the smoke.</p>
              <p> 　　The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; the bombs plunged 
                into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes in it; what was 
                the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to 
                the fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species 
                of redoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain 
                by its enormous size.</p>
              <p> 　　A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du 
                Temple which debouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, 
                if one thrust one's head bodily beyond the point formed by the 
                front of the Dallemagne shop, one perceived in the distance, beyond 
                the canal, in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville 
                at the culminating point of the rise, a strange wall reaching 
                to the second story of the house fronts, a sort of hyphen between 
                the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as though 
                the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order 
                to close itself abruptly. This wall was built of paving-stones. 
                It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the 
                square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course, 
                but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering 
                with its rigid architecture. The entablature was mathematically 
                parallel with the base. From distance to distance, one could distinguish 
                on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which resembled 
                black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other 
                by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the eye could 
                reach.</p>
              <p> 　　All windows and doors were closed.</p>
              <p> 　　In the background rose this barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare 
                of the street, a motionless and tranquil wall; no one was visible, 
                nothing was audible; not a cry, not a sound, not a breath.</p>
              <p> 　　A sepulchre.</p>
              <p> 　　The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with 
                light.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, 
                it was impossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful 
                before this mysterious apparition.</p>
              <p> 　　It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated, rectilinear, symmetrical 
                and funereal.</p>
              <p> 　　Science and gloom met there.</p>
              <p> 　　One felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician 
                or a spectre.</p>
              <p> 　　One looked at it and spoke low.</p>
              <p> 　　From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative 
                of the people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, 
                sharp whistle was heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, 
                or, if he escaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen to 
                ensconce itself in some closed shutter, in the interstice between 
                two blocks of stone, or in the plaster of a wall.</p>
              <p> 　　For the men in the barricade had made themselves two small 
                cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe, plugged up at 
                one end with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of useless 
                powder.</p>
              <p> 　　Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and there, 
                and pools of blood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly 
                which went and came in the street. Summer does not abdicate.</p>
              <p> 　　In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cocheres 
                were encumbered with wounded.</p>
              <p> 　　One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not 
                see, and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length 
                of the street.</p>
              <p> 　　Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted 
                canal forms at the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers 
                of the attacking column, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this 
                dismal redoubt, this immobility, this passivity, whence sprang 
                death. Some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of 
                the curve of the bridge, taking care that their shakos did not 
                project beyond it.</p>
              <p> 　　The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with 
                a shudder.--&quot;How that is built!&quot; he said to a Representative. 
                &quot;Not one paving-stone projects beyond its neighbor.</p>
              <p> 　　It is made of porcelain.&quot;--At that moment, a bullet broke 
                the cross on his breast, and he fell.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The cowards!&quot; people said.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let them show themselves.</p>
              <p> 　　Let us see them!</p>
              <p> 　　They dare not!</p>
              <p> 　　They are hiding!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty 
                men, attacked by ten thousand, held out for three days.</p>
              <p> 　　On the fourth, they did as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, 
                they pierced the houses, they came over the roofs, the barricade 
                was taken.</p>
              <p> 　　Not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight, all were 
                killed there with the exception of the leader, Barthelemy, of 
                whom we shall speak presently.</p>
              <p> 　　The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the 
                barricade of the Temple was silence.</p>
              <p> 　　The difference between these two redoubts was the difference 
                between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed a maw; the 
                other a mask.</p>
              <p> 　　Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June 
                was composed of a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first 
                barricade the dragon, and behind the second the sphinx.</p>
              <p> 　　These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the 
                one, Cournet, the other, Barthelemy.</p>
              <p> 　　Cournet made the Saint-Antoine barricade; Barthelemy the barricade 
                of the Temple. Each was the image of the man who had built it.</p>
              <p> 　　Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, 
                a red face, a crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere 
                and terrible eye. Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the 
                most cordial of men, the most formidable of combatants.</p>
              <p> 　　War, strife, conflict, were the very air he breathed and put 
                him in a good humor.</p>
              <p> 　　He had been an officer in the navy, and, from his gestures 
                and his voice, one divined that he sprang from the ocean, and 
                that he came from the tempest; he carried the hurricane on into 
                battle.</p>
              <p> 　　With the exception of the genius, there was in Cournet something 
                of Danton, as, with the exception of the divinity, there was in 
                Danton something of Hercules.</p>
              <p> 　　Barthelemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic 
                street urchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, 
                lay in wait for him, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent 
                to the galleys.</p>
              <p> 　　He came out and made this barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, 
                Barthelemy slew Cournet.</p>
              <p> 　　It was a funereal duel.</p>
              <p> 　　Some time afterwards, caught in the gearing of one of those 
                mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part, a catastrophe 
                in which French justice sees extenuating circumstances, and in 
                which English justice sees only death, Barthelemy was hanged.</p>
              <p> 　　The sombre social construction is so made that, thanks to 
                material destitution, thanks to moral obscurity, that unhappy 
                being who possessed an intelligence, certainly firm, possibly 
                great, began in France with the galleys, and ended in England 
                with the gallows.</p>
              <p> 　　Barthelemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.</p>

              <p> 　　HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS</p>
              <p> 　　 Jean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.</p>
              <p> 　　This march became more and more laborious.</p>
              <p> 　　The level of these vaults varies; the average height is about 
                five feet, six inches, and has been calculated for the stature 
                of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over, in order not to 
                strike Marius against the vault; at every step he had to bend, 
                then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　The moisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the 
                timber framework furnished but poor supports to which to cling, 
                either for hand or foot.</p>
              <p> 　　He stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city.</p>
              <p> 　　The intermittent gleams from the air-holes only appeared at 
                very long intervals, and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed 
                like the light of the moon; all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, 
                blackness.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean was both hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; 
                and this, like the sea, was a place full of water where a man 
                cannot drink.</p>
              <p> 　　His strength, which was prodigious, as the reader knows, and 
                which had been but little decreased by age, thanks to his chaste 
                and sober life, began to give way, nevertheless.</p>
              <p> 　　Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his strength decreased, 
                it made the weight of his burden increase.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius, who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert 
                bodies weigh.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was 
                not oppressed, and so that respiration could proceed as well as 
                possible.</p>
              <p> 　　Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats. One 
                of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him. From 
                time to time, a breath of fresh air reached him through the vent-holes 
                of the mouths of the sewer, and re-animated him.</p>
              <p> 　　It might have been three hours past midday when he reached 
                the belt-sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　He was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening.</p>
              <p> 　　He found himself, all at once, in a gallery where his outstretched 
                hands could not reach the two walls, and beneath a vault which 
                his head did not touch. The Grand Sewer is, in fact, eight feet 
                wide and seven feet high.</p>
              <p> 　　At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, 
                two other subterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, 
                and that of the Abattoir, form a square.</p>
              <p> 　　Between these four ways, a less sagacious man would have remained 
                undecided.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean selected the broadest, that is to say, the belt-sewer. 
                But here the question again came up--should he descend or ascend? 
                He thought that the situation required haste, and that he must 
                now gain the Seine at any risk.</p>
              <p> 　　In other terms, he must descend. He turned to the left.</p>
              <p> 　　It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose 
                that the belt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction 
                of Bercy, the other towards Passy, and that it is, as its name 
                indicates, the subterranean girdle of the Paris on the right bank.</p>
              <p> 　　The Grand Sewer, which is, it must be remembered, nothing 
                else than the old brook of Menilmontant, terminates, if one ascends 
                it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at its ancient point of departure 
                which was its source, at the foot of the knoll of Menilmontant.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no direct communication with the branch which collects 
                the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier Popincourt, and 
                which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer above the 
                ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the collecting 
                sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Menilmontant itself, 
                by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters, between 
                upstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery 
                he would have arrived, after a thousand efforts, and broken down 
                with fatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a 
                wall.</p>
              <p> 　　He would have been lost.</p>
              <p> 　　In case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, 
                and entering the passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition 
                that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour 
                Boucherat, and by taking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles 
                gut on the left, then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian 
                gallery, he might have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided 
                that he did not go astray in the sort of F which lies under the 
                Bastille, he might have attained the outlet on the Seine near 
                the Arsenal. But in order to do this, he must have been thoroughly 
                familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications 
                and in all its openings.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful 
                drain which he was traversing; and had any one asked him in what 
                he was, he would have answered: &quot;In the night.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　His instinct served him well.</p>
              <p> 　　To descend was, in fact, possible safety.</p>
              <p> 　　He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch 
                out in the form of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges 
                and the long, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussee d'Antin.</p>
              <p> 　　A little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine 
                branch, he halted.</p>
              <p> 　　He was extremely weary.</p>
              <p> 　　A passably large air-hole, probably the man-hole in the Rue 
                d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almost vivid. Jean Valjean, 
                with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise 
                towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the banquette 
                of the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' blood-stained face appeared under the wan light of 
                the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His eyes 
                were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like a 
                painter's brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp and dead.</p>
              <p> 　　A clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his 
                limbs were cold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; 
                his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his 
                coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh. Jean 
                Valjean, pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers, 
                laid his hand upon Marius' breast; his heart was still beating. 
                Jean Valjean tore up his shirt, bandaged the young man's wounds 
                as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood; then bending 
                over Marius, who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing, 
                in that half light, he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred.</p>
              <p> 　　On disarranging Marius' garments, he had found two things 
                in his pockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the 
                preceding evening, and Marius' pocketbook.</p>
              <p> 　　He ate the roll and opened the pocketbook. On the first page 
                he found the four lines written by Marius. The reader will recall 
                them:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is Marius Pontmercy.</p>
              <p> 　　Carry my body to my grandfather, M. Gillenormand, Rue des 
                Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, 
                and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating 
                in a low tone:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He replaced the pocketbook in Marius' pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　He had eaten, his strength had returned to him; he took Marius 
                up once more upon his back, placed the latter's head carefully 
                on his right shoulder, and resumed his descent of the sewer.</p>
              <p> 　　The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley 
                of Menilmontant, is about two leagues long.</p>
              <p> 　　It is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent.</p>
              <p> 　　This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which 
                we are illuminating for the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean 
                march, Jean Valjean himself did not possess.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing, 
                nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of the pools 
                of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him 
                that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day 
                would soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having 
                become intermittent instead of continuous, then having almost 
                ceased, he concluded that he was no longer under central Paris, 
                and that he was approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity 
                of the outer boulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there 
                are fewer houses and streets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The 
                gloom deepened around Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in 
                the dark.</p>
              <p> 　　Suddenly this darkness became terrible.</p>

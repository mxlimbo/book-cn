              <p> 　　THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS</p>
              <p> 　　 They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness.</p>
              <p> 　　They did not notice the cholera which decimated Paris precisely 
                during that very month. They had confided in each other as far 
                as possible, but this had not extended much further than their 
                names.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had told Cosette that he was an orphan, that his name 
                was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, that he lived by writing 
                things for publishers, that his father had been a colonel, that 
                the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on bad terms 
                with his grandfather who was rich.</p>
              <p> 　　He had also hinted at being a baron, but this had produced 
                no effect on Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　She did not know the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　On her side, she had confided to him that she had been brought 
                up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that her mother, like his own, 
                was dead, that her father's name was M. Fauchelevent, that he 
                was very good, that he gave a great deal to the poor, but that 
                he was poor himself, and that he denied himself everything though 
                he denied her nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived 
                since he had been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even 
                the most recent past, had become so confused and distant to him, 
                that what Cosette told him satisfied him completely. It did not 
                even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in 
                the hovel, about Thenardier, about the burn, and about the strange 
                attitude and singular flight of her father. Marius had momentarily 
                forgotten all this; in the evening he did not even know that there 
                had been a morning, what he had done, where he had breakfasted, 
                nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which rendered 
                him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hours 
                when he saw Cosette.</p>
              <p> 　　Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural that he should 
                forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial 
                pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers.</p>
              <p> 　　Alas!</p>
              <p> 　　Who is there who has not felt all these things?</p>
              <p> 　　Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, 
                and why does life go on afterwards?</p>
              <p> 　　Loving almost takes the place of thinking.</p>
              <p> 　　Love is an ardent forgetfulness of all the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　Then ask logic of passion if you will. There is no more absolute 
                logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical 
                figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette and Marius nothing 
                existed except Marius and Cosette. The universe around them had 
                fallen into a hole.</p>
              <p> 　　They lived in a golden minute.</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred 
                to Marius that Cosette had a father.</p>
              <p> 　　His brain was dazzled and obliterated.</p>
              <p> 　　Of what did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the flowers, 
                and the swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all 
                sorts of important things.</p>
              <p> 　　They had told each other everything except everything.</p>
              <p> 　　The everything of lovers is nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　But the father, the realities, that lair, the ruffians, that 
                adventure, to what purpose?</p>
              <p> 　　And was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed?</p>
              <p> 　　They were two, and they adored each other, and beyond that 
                there was nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing else existed. It is probable that this vanishing of 
                hell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise.</p>
              <p> 　　Have we beheld demons?</p>
              <p> 　　Are there any? Have we trembled?</p>
              <p> 　　Have we suffered?</p>
              <p> 　　We no longer know.</p>
              <p> 　　A rosy cloud hangs over it.</p>
              <p> 　　So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with 
                all that improbability which is in nature; neither at the nadir 
                nor at the zenith, between man and seraphim, above the mire, below 
                the ether, in the clouds; hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy 
                from head to foot; already too sublime to walk the earth, still 
                too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue, suspended 
                like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond 
                the bounds of destiny; ignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, 
                to-morrow; amazed, rapturous, floating, soaring; at times so light 
                that they could take their flight out into the infinite; almost 
                prepared to soar away to all eternity.</p>
              <p> 　　They slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy 
                of the real overwhelmed by the ideal.</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes 
                in her presence.</p>
              <p> 　　The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was 
                to lead them. They considered that they had already arrived.</p>
              <p> 　　It is a strange claim on man's part to wish that love should 
                lead to something.</p>

              <p> 　　THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL</p>
              <p> 　　The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Feel how cold I am,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bah!&quot; replied the father, &quot;I am much colder 
                than that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The mother exclaimed impetuously:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You always have something better than any one else, 
                so you do! even bad things.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Down with you!&quot; said the man.</p>
              <p> 　　The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.</p>
              <p> 　　Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel.</p>
              <p> 　　The elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her 
                mantle, with a careless air; her younger sister continued to sob; 
                the mother had taken the latter's head between her hands, and 
                was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the while:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, 
                don't cry, you will anger your father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No!&quot; exclaimed the father, &quot;quite the contrary! 
                sob! sob! that's right.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then turning to the elder:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There now!</p>
              <p> 　　He is not coming!</p>
              <p> 　　What if he were not to come! I shall have extinguished my 
                fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my pane all 
                for nothing.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And wounded the child!&quot; murmured the mother.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Do you know,&quot; went on the father, &quot;that it's 
                beastly cold in this devil's garret!</p>
              <p> 　　What if that man should not come!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　See there, you!</p>
              <p> 　　He makes us wait!</p>
              <p> 　　He says to himself:</p>
              <p> 　　`Well! they will wait for me!</p>
              <p> 　　That's what they're there for.'</p>
              <p> 　　Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy, jubilation, enthusiasm, 
                and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich folks! all those 
                rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on 
                airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, 
                preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above us, 
                and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us 
                `clothes,' as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous!</p>
              <p> 　　And bread! That's not what I want, pack of rascals that they 
                are, it's money! Ah! money!</p>
              <p> 　　Never!</p>
              <p> 　　Because they say that we would go off and drink it up, and 
                that we are drunkards and idlers!</p>
              <p> 　　And they! What are they, then, and what have they been in 
                their time!</p>
              <p> 　　Thieves! They never could have become rich otherwise!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　Society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth 
                and tossed into the air, all of it!</p>
              <p> 　　It would all be smashed, very likely, but at least, no one 
                would have anything, and there would be that much gained! But 
                what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he 
                come?</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps the animal has forgotten the address! I'll bet that 
                that old beast--&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man 
                rushed to it and opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and 
                smiles of adoration:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Enter, sir!</p>
              <p> 　　Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and your charming 
                young lady, also.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on 
                the threshold of the attic.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had not quitted his post.</p>
              <p> 　　His feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human 
                tongue.</p>
              <p> 　　It was She!</p>
              <p> 　　Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained 
                in those three letters of that word:</p>
              <p> 　　She.</p>
              <p> 　　It was certainly she.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor 
                which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was that sweet, 
                absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six months; 
                it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished 
                face which had created night by its departure. The vision had 
                been eclipsed, now it reappeared.</p>
              <p> 　　It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen 
                attic, in all that horror.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius shuddered in dismay.</p>
              <p> 　　What!</p>
              <p> 　　It was she!</p>
              <p> 　　The palpitations of his heart troubled his sight.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears!</p>
              <p> 　　What!</p>
              <p> 　　He beheld her again at last, after having sought her so long!</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had 
                just found it again.</p>
              <p> 　　She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate 
                face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed 
                beneath a pelisse of black satin.</p>
              <p> 　　Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could be caught of her tiny 
                foot shod in a silken boot.</p>
              <p> 　　She was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　She had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited 
                a tolerably bulky parcel on the table.</p>
              <p> 　　The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and 
                was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk 
                mantle, and that charming, happy face.</p>

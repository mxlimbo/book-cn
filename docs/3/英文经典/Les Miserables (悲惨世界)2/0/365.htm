              <p> 　　LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL</p>
              <p> 　　One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three 
                steps in the street, seated himself on a post, on that same stone 
                post where Gavroche had found him meditating on the night between 
                the 5th and the 6th of June; he remained there a few moments, 
                then went up stairs again.</p>
              <p> 　　This was the last oscillation of the pendulum.</p>
              <p> 　　On the following day he did not leave his apartment.</p>
              <p> 　　On the day after that, he did not leave his bed.</p>
              <p> 　　His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages 
                or potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate 
                and exclaimed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Certainly I did,&quot; replied Jean Valjean.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The plate is quite full.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Look at the water jug.</p>
              <p> 　　It is empty.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that 
                you have eaten.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Jean Valjean, &quot;what if I felt 
                hungry only for water?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at 
                the same time, it is called fever.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will eat to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Or at Trinity day.</p>
              <p> 　　Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say:</p>
              <p> 　　`I will eat to-morrow'? The idea of leaving my platter without 
                even touching it!</p>
              <p> 　　My ladyfinger potatoes were so good!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean took the old woman's hand:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I promise you that I will eat them,&quot; he said, in 
                his benevolent voice.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am not pleased with you,&quot; replied the portress.</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman.</p>
              <p> 　　There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, 
                and houses to which no one ever comes.</p>
              <p> 　　He was in one of those streets and one of those houses.</p>
              <p> 　　While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, 
                for a few sous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up 
                on a nail opposite his bed.</p>
              <p> 　　That gibbet is always good to look at.</p>
              <p> 　　A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his 
                room.</p>
              <p> 　　He still remained in bed.</p>
              <p> 　　The portress said to her husband:--&quot;The good man upstairs 
                yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last long.</p>
              <p> 　　That man has his sorrows, that he has.</p>
              <p> 　　You won't get it out of my head that his daughter has made 
                a bad marriage.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If he's rich, let him have a doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　If he is not rich, let him go without.</p>
              <p> 　　If he has no doctor he will die.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And if he has one?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He will die,&quot; said the porter.</p>
              <p> 　　The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she 
                called her pavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the 
                blades, she grumbled:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's a shame.</p>
              <p> 　　Such a neat old man!</p>
              <p> 　　He's as white as a chicken.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed 
                the end of the street; she took it upon herself to request him 
                to come up stairs.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It's on the second floor,&quot; said she.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You have only to enter.</p>
              <p> 　　As the good man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is 
                always unlocked.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him.</p>
              <p> 　　When he came down again the portress interrogated him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well, doctor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Your sick man is very ill indeed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is the matter with him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything and nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　He is a man who, to all appearances, has lost some person 
                who is dear to him.</p>
              <p> 　　People die of that.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What did he say to you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He told me that he was in good health.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Shall you come again, doctor?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the doctor.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But some one else besides must come.&quot;</p>

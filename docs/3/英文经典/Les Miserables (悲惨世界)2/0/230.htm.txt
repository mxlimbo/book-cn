              <p> 　　FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES</p>
              <p> 　　 Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. 
                The fermentation entered the boiling state.</p>
              <p> 　　Ever since 1830, petty partial revolts had been going on here 
                and there, which were quickly suppressed, but ever bursting forth 
                afresh, the sign of a vast underlying conflagration.</p>
              <p> 　　Something terrible was in preparation.</p>
              <p> 　　Glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct 
                and imperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. France kept 
                an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>
              <p> 　　The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was 
                beginning its ebullition.</p>
              <p> 　　The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union 
                of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, 
                grave and stormy.</p>
              <p> 　　The government was there purely and simply called in question. 
                There people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of 
                keeping quiet.</p>
              <p> 　　There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear 
                that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, 
                and &quot;that they would fight without counting the number of 
                the enemy.&quot; This engagement once entered into, a man seated 
                in the corner of the wine-shop &quot;assumed a sonorous tone,&quot; 
                and said, &quot;You understand! You have sworn!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Sometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first 
                floor, and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted.</p>
              <p> 　　They made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself 
                as well as to the fathers of families.</p>
              <p> 　　That was the formula.</p>
              <p> 　　In the tap-rooms, &quot;subversive&quot; pamphlets were read.</p>
              <p> 　　They treated the government with contempt, says a secret report 
                of that time.</p>
              <p> 　　Words like the following could be heard there:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't know the names of the leaders.</p>
              <p> 　　We folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　One workman said: &quot;There are three hundred of us, let 
                each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and fifty 
                francs with which to procure powder and shot.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two. 
                In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. 
                With twenty-five thousand men we can face them.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Another said: &quot;I don't sleep at night, because I make 
                cartridges all night.&quot; From time to time, men &quot;of bourgeois 
                appearance, and in good coats&quot; came and &quot;caused embarrassment,&quot; 
                and with the air of &quot;command,&quot; shook hands with the 
                most important, and then went away.</p>
              <p> 　　They never stayed more than ten minutes.</p>
              <p> 　　Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It was murmured by all who were there,&quot; to borrow 
                the very expression of one of those who were present.</p>
              <p> 　　The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, 
                efore the whole wine-shop: &quot;We have no arms!&quot; One of 
                his comrades replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The soldiers have!&quot; thus parodying without being 
                aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation to the army in Italy:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,&quot; 
                adds one report, &quot;they did not communicate it to each other.&quot; 
                It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what 
                they said.</p>
              <p> 　　These reunions were sometimes periodical.</p>
              <p> 　　At certain ones of them, there were never more than eight 
                or ten persons present, and they were always the same.</p>
              <p> 　　In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was so 
                full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through 
                enthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way to 
                their work.</p>
              <p> 　　As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some 
                of these wine-shops who embraced new-comers.</p>
              <p> 　　Other expressive facts came to light.</p>
              <p> 　　A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark: 
                &quot;Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing 
                the Rue de Charonne.</p>
              <p> 　　The balloting was carried on in their caps.</p>
              <p> 　　Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons 
                in the Rue de Cotte.</p>
              <p> 　　There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords, 
                canes, clubs, and foils.</p>
              <p> 　　One day, the buttons were removed from the foils.</p>
              <p> 　　A workman said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There are twenty-five of us, but they don't count on 
                me, because I am looked upon as a machine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Later on, that machine became Quenisset.</p>
              <p> 　　The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired 
                a strange and indescribable notoriety.</p>
              <p> 　　A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to another woman:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For a long time, there has been a strong force busy 
                making cartridges.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the open street, proclamation could be seen addressed to 
                the National Guard in the departments. One of these proclamations 
                was signed:</p>
              <p> 　　Burtot, wine-merchant.</p>
              <p> 　　One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an 
                Italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller 
                in the Marche Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which 
                seemed to emanate from an occult power.</p>
              <p> 　　Groups formed around him, and applauded.</p>
              <p> 　　The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected 
                and noted down.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, 
                our bill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.&quot;--&quot;The 
                breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted 
                to us many mediums.&quot;--&quot;The future of nations is being 
                worked out in our obscure ranks.&quot;--&quot; Here are the fixed 
                terms:</p>
              <p> 　　action or reaction, revolution or counter-revolution. For, 
                at our epoch, we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility.</p>
              <p> 　　For the people against the people, that is the question.</p>
              <p> 　　There is no other.&quot;--&quot;On the day when we cease to 
                suit you, break us, but up to that day, help us to march on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All this in broad daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the 
                eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity.</p>
              <p> 　　On the 4th of April, 1832, a passer-by mounted the post on 
                the corner which forms the angle of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite 
                and shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I am a Babouvist!&quot; But beneath Babeuf, the people 
                scented Gisquet.</p>
              <p> 　　Among other things, this man said:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Down with property!</p>
              <p> 　　The opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous.</p>
              <p> 　　When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches revolution, 
                it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and royalist 
                so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts with 
                feathers.</p>
              <p> 　　Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring classes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Silence, citizen spy!&quot; cried an artisan.</p>
              <p> 　　This shout put an end to the discourse.</p>
              <p> 　　Mysterious incidents occurred.</p>
              <p> 　　At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a &quot;very 
                well dressed man,&quot; who said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Whither are you bound, citizen?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sir,&quot; replied the workingman, &quot;I have not 
                the honor of your acquaintance.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I know you very well, however.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the man added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't be alarmed, I am an agent of the committee. You 
                are suspected of not being quite faithful.</p>
              <p> 　　You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed 
                on you.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We shall meet again soon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, 
                not only in the wine-shops, but in the street.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Get yourself received very soon,&quot; said a weaver 
                to a cabinet-maker.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There is going to be a shot to fire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, 
                fraught with evident Jacquerie:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who governs us?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;M. Philippe.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, it is the bourgeoisie.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word 
                Jacquerie in a bad sense.</p>
              <p> 　　The Jacques were the poor.</p>
              <p> 　　On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other 
                as they passed by:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We have a good plan of attack.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Only the following was caught of a private conversation between 
                four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere 
                du Trone:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking 
                about Paris any more.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Who was the he?</p>
              <p> 　　Menacing obscurity.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The principal leaders,&quot; as they said in the faubourg, 
                held themselves apart.</p>
              <p> 　　It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop 
                near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society 
                aid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving 
                as intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about 
                these leaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular 
                arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before 
                the Court of Peers:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who was your leader?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I knew of none and I recognized none.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes 
                idle reports, rumors, hearsay.</p>
              <p> 　　Other indications cropped up.</p>
              <p> 　　A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around 
                the ground on which a house was in process of construction, in 
                the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter 
                on which were still legible the following lines:--</p>
              <p> 　　 The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in 
                the sections for the different societies.</p>
              <p> 　　 And, as a postscript:--</p>
              <p> 　　 We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, 
                No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house 
                of a gunsmith in that court.</p>
              <p> 　　The section owns no arms.</p>
              <p> 　　 What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing 
                to his neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he 
                picked up another paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, 
                of which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest 
                attaching to these strange documents:--</p>
              <p>　　| Q| C | D | E | Learn this list by heart. After so doing | 
                | | | || you will tear it up. The men admitted | | | | | | will 
                do thesame when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders 
                to them. | | | | | | Health and Fraternity, | | | | | | u og a 
                fe L. |</p>
              <p> 　　 It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret 
                of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four 
                capital letters:</p>
              <p> 　　quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs [scouts], and 
                the sense of the letters:</p>
              <p> 　　u og a fe, which was a date, and meant April 15th, 1832.</p>
              <p> 　　Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by 
                very characteristic notes.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus:</p>
              <p> 　　Q. Bannerel. 8 guns, 83 cartridges.</p>
              <p> 　　A safe man.--C. Boubiere.</p>
              <p> 　　1 pistol, 40 cartridges.--D. Rollet.</p>
              <p> 　　1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.-- E. Tessier.</p>
              <p> 　　1 sword, 1 cartridge-box. Exact.--Terreur.</p>
              <p> 　　8 guns. Brave, etc.</p>
              <p> 　　Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, 
                a third paper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, 
                this sort of enigmatical list:--Unite:</p>
              <p> 　　Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6. </p>
              <p> 　　Barra.</p>
              <p> 　　Soize.</p>
              <p> 　　Salle-au-Comte. </p>
              <p> 　　Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher? </p>
              <p> 　　J. J. R. </p>
              <p> 　　Caius Gracchus. </p>
              <p> 　　Right of revision.</p>
              <p> 　　Dufond.</p>
              <p> 　　Four. </p>
              <p> 　　Fall of the Girondists.</p>
              <p> 　　Derbac.</p>
              <p> 　　Maubuee. </p>

              <p> 　　 The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew 
                its significance.</p>
              <p> 　　It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of 
                the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the 
                Rights of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. 
                To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more 
                than history, we may publish them.</p>

                the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date when 
                this paper was found.</p>
              <p> 　　Perhaps this was only a rough draft.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according 
                to written notes, material facts begin to make their appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, 
                there were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike 
                lengthwise and in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares 
                of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and 
                a card, on which was written the following:-- </p>

              <p> 　　THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED</p>
              <p> 　　 The daylight was increasing rapidly.</p>
              <p> 　　Not a window was opened, not a door stood ajar; it was the 
                dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, 
                opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the troops, as we 
                have stated it seemed to be free, and presented itself to passers-by 
                with a sinister tranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was as dumb 
                as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in the 
                cross-roads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets. 
                Nothing was to be seen, but there was something to be heard. A 
                mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance. It was 
                evident that the critical moment was approaching.</p>
              <p> 　　As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but 
                this time all had come.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first 
                attack. Since the departure of the five, they had increased its 
                height still further.</p>
              <p> 　　On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region 
                of the Halles, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came 
                to a serious decision.</p>
              <p> 　　He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane, which had been 
                left open up to that time, barricaded.</p>
              <p> 　　For this purpose, they tore up the pavement for the length 
                of several houses more. In this manner, the barricade, walled 
                on three streets, in front on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, to the 
                left on the Rues du Cygne and de la Petite Truanderie, to the 
                right on the Rue Mondetour, was really almost impregnable; it 
                is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. It had three fronts, 
                but no exit.--&quot;A fortress but a rat hole too,&quot; said 
                Courfeyrac with a laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones &quot;torn up in excess,&quot; 
                said Bossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.</p>
              <p> 　　The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the 
                attack must needs come, that Enjolras had each man resume his 
                post of battle.</p>
              <p> 　　An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an 
                assault. Each man selects his place as though at the theatre.</p>
              <p> 　　They jostle, and elbow and crowd each other.</p>
              <p> 　　There are some who make stalls of paving-stones. Here is a 
                corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here is 
                a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind 
                it.</p>
              <p> 　　Left-handed men are precious; they take the places that are 
                inconvenient to the rest.</p>
              <p> 　　Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture.</p>
              <p> 　　They wish to be at ease to kill, and to die comfortably.</p>
              <p> 　　In the sad war of June, 1848, an insurgent who was a formidable 
                marksman, and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon a 
                roof, had a reclining-chair brought there for his use; a charge 
                of grape-shot found him out there.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks 
                for action, all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling 
                from one another; there are no more coteries; no more asides, 
                there is no more holding aloof; everything in their spirits converges 
                in, and changes into, a waiting for the assailants.</p>
              <p> 　　A barricade before the arrival of danger is chaos; in danger, 
                it is discipline itself. Peril produces order.</p>
              <p> 　　As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, 
                and had placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved 
                for himself, all the rest held their peace.</p>
              <p> 　　A series of faint, sharp noises resounded confusedly along 
                the wall of paving-stones. It was the men cocking their guns.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than 
                ever; the excess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished 
                any hope, but they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which 
                sometimes gives victory; Virgil has said so.</p>
              <p> 　　Supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions.</p>
              <p> 　　To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a shipwreck; 
                and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.</p>
              <p> 　　As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, 
                we might almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted 
                up and visible.</p>
              <p> 　　They had not long to wait.</p>
              <p> 　　A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu quarter, but it did 
                not resemble the movement of the first attack. A clashing of chains, 
                the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brass skipping along 
                the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that some sinister 
                construction of iron was approaching. There arose a tremor in 
                the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built for 
                the fertile circulation of interests and ideas, and which are 
                not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war.</p>
              <p> 　　The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity 
                of the street became ferocious.</p>
              <p> 　　A cannon made its appearance.</p>
              <p> 　　Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; 
                the fore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, 
                four were at the wheels; others followed with the caisson. They 
                could see the smoke of the burning lint-stock.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fire!&quot; shouted Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche 
                of smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few 
                seconds, the cloud dispersed, and the cannon and men re-appeared; 
                the gun-crew had just finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without 
                haste, into position facing the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　Not one of them had been struck. Then the captain of the piece, 
                bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle, began 
                to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling 
                a telescope.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bravo for the cannoneers!&quot; cried Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　And the whole barricade clapped their hands.</p>
              <p> 　　A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the 
                street, astride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action.</p>
              <p> 　　A formidable pair of jaws yawned on the barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Come, merrily now!&quot; ejaculated Courfeyrac.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That's the brutal part of it.</p>
              <p> 　　After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The 
                army is reaching out its big paw to us.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade is going to be severely shaken up.</p>
              <p> 　　The fusillade tries, the cannon takes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is a piece of eight, new model, brass,&quot; added 
                Combeferre. &quot;Those pieces are liable to burst as soon as 
                the proportion of ten parts of tin to one hundred of brass is 
                exceeded.</p>
              <p> 　　The excess of tin renders them too tender.</p>
              <p> 　　Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when 
                looked at from the vent hole.</p>
              <p> 　　In order to obviate this danger, and to render it possible 
                to force the charge, it may become necessary to return to the 
                process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to encircle the 
                piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands, from 
                the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy this 
                defect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes 
                are located in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher.</p>
              <p> 　　But there is a better method, with Gribeauval's movable star.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;In the sixteenth century,&quot; remarked Bossuet, &quot;they 
                used to rifle cannon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Combeferre, &quot;that augments the 
                projectile force, but diminishes the accuracy of the firing.</p>
              <p> 　　In firing at short range, the trajectory is not as rigid as 
                could be desired, the parabola is exaggerated, the line of the 
                projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its 
                striking intervening objects, which is, nevertheless, a necessity 
                of battle, the importance of which increases with the proximity 
                of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge. This defect 
                of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled cannon 
                of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge; 
                small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic 
                necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the gun-carriage. 
                In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it desires; 
                force is a great weakness.</p>
              <p> 　　A cannon-ball only travels six hundred leagues an hour; light 
                travels seventy thousand leagues a second.</p>
              <p> 　　Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Reload your guns,&quot; said Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under 
                the cannon-balls? Would they effect a breach?</p>
              <p> 　　That was the question. While the insurgents were reloading 
                their guns, the artillery-men were loading the cannon.</p>
              <p> 　　The anxiety in the redoubt was profound.</p>
              <p> 　　The shot sped the report burst forth.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Present!&quot; shouted a joyous voice.</p>
              <p> 　　And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the 
                ball dashed against it.</p>
              <p> 　　He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had 
                nimbly climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the 
                labyrinth of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than 
                the cannon-ball.</p>
              <p> 　　The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish.</p>
              <p> 　　At the most there was an omnibus wheel broken, and the old 
                Anceau cart was demolished. On seeing this, the barricade burst 
                into a laugh.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go on!&quot; shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.</p>

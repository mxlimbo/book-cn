              <p> 　　OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS</p>
              <p> 　　Hardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards 
                the pallets, which were empty.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How is the poor little wounded girl?&quot; he inquired.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Bad,&quot; replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and 
                grateful smile, &quot;very bad, my worthy sir.</p>
              <p> 　　Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt 
                dressed.</p>
              <p> 　　You will see them presently; they will be back immediately.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,&quot; went 
                on M. Leblanc, casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the 
                Jondrette woman, as she stood between him and the door, as though 
                already guarding the exit, and gazed at him in an attitude of 
                menace and almost of combat.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;She is dying,&quot; said Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;But what do you expect, sir! She has so much courage, 
                that woman has!</p>
              <p> 　　She's not a woman, she's an ox.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with 
                the affected airs of a flattered monster.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Jondrette!&quot; said M. Leblanc, &quot;I thought your 
                name was Fabantou?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fabantou, alias Jondrette!&quot; replied the husband 
                hurriedly. &quot;An artistic sobriquet!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. 
                Leblanc did not catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing 
                inflection of voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling 
                and I! What would there be left for us if we had not that?</p>
              <p> 　　We are so wretched, my respectable sir!</p>
              <p> 　　We have arms, but there is no work!</p>
              <p> 　　We have the will, no work!</p>
              <p> 　　I don't know how the government arranges that, but, on my 
                word of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.[30] 
                I don't wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my 
                most sacred word, things would be different.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, for instance, I wanted to have my girls taught the trade 
                of paper-box makers. You will say to me:</p>
              <p> 　　`What! a trade?'</p>
              <p> 　　Yes!</p>
              <p> 　　A trade!</p>
              <p> 　　A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor!</p>
              <p> 　　What a degradation, when one has been what we have been!</p>
              <p> 　　Alas!</p>
              <p> 　　There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity!</p>
              <p> 　　One thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, 
                but which I am willing to part with, for I must live!</p>
              <p> 　　Item, one must live!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　[30] A democrat.</p>
              <p> 　　While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence 
                which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression 
                of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the 
                other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before. A 
                man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been heard 
                to turn on its hinges.</p>
              <p> 　　This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, 
                spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton 
                velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, 
                his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black.</p>
              <p> 　　He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, 
                as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.</p>
              <p> 　　That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, 
                caused M. Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. 
                He could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not 
                escape Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　I see!&quot; exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with 
                an air of complaisance, &quot;you are looking at your overcoat?</p>
              <p> 　　It fits me! My faith, but it fits me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Who is that man?&quot; said M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Him?&quot; ejaculated Jondrette, &quot;he's a neighbor 
                of mine.</p>
              <p> 　　Don't pay any attention to him.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The neighbor was a singular-looking individual.</p>
              <p> 　　However, manufactories of chemical products abound in the 
                Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the workmen might have black faces.</p>
              <p> 　　Besides this, M. Leblanc's whole person was expressive of 
                candid and intrepid confidence.</p>
              <p> 　　He went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,&quot; replied 
                Jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating M. 
                Leblanc with steady and tender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the 
                boa-constrictor, &quot;I was telling you, that I have a picture 
                to sell.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　A slight sound came from the door.</p>
              <p> 　　A second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed, 
                behind Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink 
                or lampblack.</p>
              <p> 　　Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he 
                had not been able to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't mind them,&quot; said Jondrette, &quot;they are 
                people who belong in the house.</p>
              <p> 　　So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable 
                picture.</p>
              <p> 　　But stop, sir, take a look at it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel 
                which we have already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving 
                it supported against the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　It really was something which resembled a picture, and which 
                the candle illuminated, somewhat.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius could make nothing out of it, as Jondrette stood between 
                the picture and him; he only saw a coarse daub, and a sort of 
                principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign 
                canvasses and screen paintings.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is that?&quot; asked M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my 
                benefactor! I am as much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; 
                it recalls souvenirs to me!</p>
              <p> 　　But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am 
                so wretched that I will part with it.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning 
                uneasiness, M. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the 
                room as he examined the picture.</p>
              <p> 　　There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing 
                near the door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with 
                faces smeared with black.</p>
              <p> 　　One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with 
                closed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. 
                He was old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face 
                produced a horrible effect.</p>
              <p> 　　The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the other 
                wore his hair long.</p>
              <p> 　　None of them had on shoes; those who did not wear socks were 
                barefooted.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these 
                men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are friends.</p>
              <p> 　　They are neighbors,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Their faces are black because they work in charcoal.</p>
              <p> 　　They are chimney-builders. Don't trouble yourself about them, 
                my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my misery.</p>
              <p> 　　I will not ask you much for it.</p>
              <p> 　　How much do you think it is worth?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Well,&quot; said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full 
                in the eye, and with the manner of a man who is on his guard, 
                &quot;it is some signboard for a tavern, and is worth about three 
                francs.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette replied sweetly:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Have you your pocket-book with you?</p>
              <p> 　　I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and 
                cast a rapid glance around the room.</p>
              <p> 　　He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, 
                and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the 
                side next the door.</p>
              <p> 　　The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to be looking 
                on.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with 
                so vague an eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc 
                might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who 
                had simply gone mad with misery.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,&quot; 
                said Jondrette, &quot;I shall be left without resources; there 
                will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river.</p>
              <p> 　　When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught the 
                middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for New Year's 
                gifts!</p>
              <p> 　　Well!</p>
              <p> 　　A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling 
                off is required, then a special stove is needed, a pot with three 
                compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste, 
                according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife 
                to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the 
                steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all?</p>
              <p> 　　And all that in order to earn four sous a day!</p>
              <p> 　　And you have to work fourteen hours a day! And each box passes 
                through the workwoman's hands thirteen times! And you can't wet 
                the paper!</p>
              <p> 　　And you mustn't spot anything!</p>
              <p> 　　And you must keep the paste hot.</p>
              <p> 　　The devil, I tell you!</p>
              <p> 　　Four sous a day! How do you suppose a man is to live?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was 
                observing him. M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette's 
                eye was fixed on the door.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius' eager attention was transferred from one to the other. 
                M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is this man an idiot?&quot; Jondrette repeated two or 
                three distinct times, with all manner of varying inflections of 
                the whining and supplicating order: &quot;There is nothing left 
                for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps 
                at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that 
                purpose.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; 
                the little man drew himself up and became terrible, took a step 
                toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;That has nothing to do with the question!</p>
              <p> 　　Do you know me?&quot;</p>

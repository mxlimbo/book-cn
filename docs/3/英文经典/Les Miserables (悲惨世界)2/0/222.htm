              <p> 　　THE TRAP</p>
              <p> 　　The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed 
                a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with 
                masks of black paper.</p>
              <p> 　　The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the 
                second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of 
                the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe for 
                slaughtering cattle.</p>
              <p> 　　The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender 
                as the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the 
                door of some prison.</p>
              <p> 　　It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette 
                had been waiting for.</p>
              <p> 　　A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel, 
                the thin one.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is everything ready?&quot; said Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the thin man.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where is Montparnasse?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The young principal actor stopped to chat with your 
                girl.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Which?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;The eldest.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is there a carriage at the door?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is the team harnessed?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;With two good horses?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excellent.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is it waiting where I ordered?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Good,&quot; said Jondrette.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc was very pale.</p>
              <p> 　　He was scrutinizing everything around him in the den, like 
                a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his head, directed 
                in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved on his 
                neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was 
                nothing in his air which resembled fear.</p>
              <p> 　　He had improvised an intrenchment out of the table; and the 
                man, who but an instant previously, had borne merely the appearance 
                of a kindly old man, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, and 
                placed his robust fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable 
                and surprising gesture.</p>
              <p> 　　This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence 
                of such a danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which 
                are as courageous as they are kind, both easily and simply. The 
                father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us. Marius 
                felt proud of that unknown man.</p>
              <p> 　　Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;They are chimney-builders,&quot; had armed themselves 
                from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair of shears, the 
                second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and had placed 
                themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely opened 
                his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention 
                would arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, 
                in the direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his 
                pistol.</p>
              <p> 　　Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with 
                the cudgel, turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, 
                accompanying it with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which 
                was peculiar to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;So you do not recognize me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then Jondrette advanced to the table.</p>
              <p> 　　He leaned across the candle, crossing his arms, putting his 
                angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblanc's calm face, and 
                advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to retreat, 
                and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite, he 
                exclaimed:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my 
                name is Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier!</p>
              <p> 　　Now do you know me?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc's brow, and 
                he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above 
                its ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No more than before.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius did not hear this reply.</p>
              <p> 　　Any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness 
                would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. 
                At the moment when Jondrette said: &quot;My name is Thenardier,&quot; 
                Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against the 
                wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his 
                heart.</p>
              <p> 　　Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, 
                dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, &quot;Thenardier, 
                do you understand?&quot; Marius's faltering fingers had come near 
                letting the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, 
                had not moved M. Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　That name of Thenardier, with which M. Leblanc did not seem 
                to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader recall what 
                that name meant to him!</p>
              <p> 　　That name he had worn on his heart, inscribed in his father's 
                testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths 
                of his memory, in that sacred injunction:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;A certain Thenardier saved my life. If my son encounters 
                him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　That name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of 
                his soul; he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship.</p>
              <p> 　　What!</p>
              <p> 　　This man was that Thenardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil 
                whom he had so long and so vainly sought!</p>
              <p> 　　He had found him at last, and how?</p>
              <p> 　　His father's saviour was a ruffian! That man, to whose service 
                Marius was burning to devote himself, was a monster!</p>
              <p> 　　That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point of committing 
                a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend, 
                but which resembled an assassination! And against whom, great 
                God! what a fatality!</p>
              <p> 　　What a bitter mockery of fate!</p>
              <p> 　　His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin 
                to do all the good in his power to this Thenardier, and for four 
                years Marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this 
                debt of his father's, and at the moment when he was on the eve 
                of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice, 
                destiny cried to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This is Thenardier!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He could at last repay this man for his father's life, saved 
                amid a hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, 
                and repay it with the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if 
                ever he found that Thenardier, he would address him only by throwing 
                himself at his feet; and now he actually had found him, but it 
                was only to deliver him over to the executioner!</p>
              <p> 　　His father said to him:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Succor Thenardier!&quot; And he replied to that adored 
                and sainted voice by crushing Thenardier! He was about to offer 
                to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn 
                him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the Place 
                Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to 
                whom he had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery 
                to have so long worn on his breast his father's last commands, 
                written in his own hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a 
                sense!</p>
              <p> 　　But, on the other hand, now look on that trap and not prevent 
                it!</p>
              <p> 　　Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be 
                held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas 
                which Marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced 
                through and through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow.</p>
              <p> 　　He shuddered.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything depended on him.</p>
              <p> 　　Unknown to themselves, he held in his hand all those beings 
                who were moving about there before his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thenardier 
                lost; if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, 
                who knows?</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier would escape.</p>
              <p> 　　Should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall?</p>
              <p> 　　Remorse awaited him in either case.</p>
              <p> 　　What was he to do?</p>
              <p> 　　What should he choose?</p>
              <p> 　　Be false to the most imperious souvenirs, to all those solemn 
                vows to himself, to the most sacred duty, to the most venerated 
                text!</p>
              <p> 　　Should he ignore his father's testament, or allow the perpetration 
                of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard &quot;his 
                Ursule&quot; supplicating for her father and on the other, the 
                colonel commending Thenardier to his care.</p>
              <p> 　　He felt that he was going mad.</p>
              <p> 　　His knees gave way beneath him.</p>
              <p> 　　And he had not even the time for deliberation, so great was 
                the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to 
                its catastrophe.</p>
              <p> 　　It was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the 
                master, and which was now sweeping him away. He was on the verge 
                of swooning.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call 
                by no other name, was pacing up and down in front of the table 
                in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph.</p>
              <p> 　　He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece 
                with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, 
                and the tallow bespattered the wall.</p>
              <p> 　　Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit 
                out these words:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Done for!</p>
              <p> 　　Smoked brown!</p>
              <p> 　　Cooked!</p>
              <p> 　　Spitchcocked!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; he cried, &quot;so I've found you again at 
                last, Mister philanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire!</p>
              <p> 　　Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! Ah! so you don't recognize 
                me!</p>
              <p> 　　No, it wasn't you who came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight 
                years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It wasn't you who carried off 
                that Fantine's child from me! The Lark!</p>
              <p> 　　It wasn't you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package 
                of duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, 
                it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings 
                into houses!</p>
              <p> 　　Old charity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister 
                millionnaire?</p>
              <p> 　　You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man!</p>
              <p> 　　What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don't recognize me?</p>
              <p> 　　Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very 
                moment you poked your snout in here. Ah! you'll find out presently, 
                that it isn't all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into 
                people's houses, under the pretext that they are taverns, in wretched 
                clothes, with the air of a poor man, to whom one would give a 
                sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take away their 
                means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you 
                can't call things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, 
                you bring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospital 
                blankets, you old blackguard, you child-stealer!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. 
                One would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, 
                like the Rhone; then, as though he were concluding aloud the things 
                which he had been saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the 
                table with his fist, and shouted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And with his goody-goody air!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Parbleu!</p>
              <p> 　　You made game of me in the past!</p>
              <p> 　　You are the cause of all my misfortunes!</p>
              <p> 　　For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and 
                who certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought 
                in a great deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted 
                enough to live on all my life!</p>
              <p> 　　A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I 
                lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual 
                row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh!</p>
              <p> 　　I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison 
                to those who drank it! Well, never mind!</p>
              <p> 　　Say, now!</p>
              <p> 　　You must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with 
                the Lark!</p>
              <p> 　　You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the stronger.</p>
              <p> 　　Revenge.</p>
              <p> 　　I'm the one to hold the trumps to-day! You're in a sorry case, 
                my good fellow!</p>
              <p> 　　Oh, but I can laugh!</p>
              <p> 　　Really, I laugh!</p>
              <p> 　　Didn't he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, 
                that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle 
                Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that my landlord insisted on being 
                paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn't even notice 
                that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time 
                when the quarter runs out!</p>
              <p> 　　Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which he has 
                brought me!</p>
              <p> 　　Scoundrel! He hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred 
                francs!</p>
              <p> 　　And how he swallowed my platitudes!</p>
              <p> 　　That did amuse me.</p>
              <p> 　　I said to myself: `Blockhead! Come, I've got you!</p>
              <p> 　　I lick your paws this morning, but I'll gnaw your heart this 
                evening!'&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier paused.</p>
              <p> 　　He was out of breath.</p>
              <p> 　　His little, narrow chest panted like a forge bellows.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble, cruel, 
                and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last, harass 
                what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy 
                of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, 
                the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so 
                nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently 
                alive to suffer still.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he 
                paused:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I do not know what you mean to say.</p>
              <p> 　　You are mistaken in me.</p>
              <p> 　　I am a very poor man, and anything but a millionnaire.</p>
              <p> 　　I do not know you. You are mistaking me for some other person.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Ah!&quot; roared Thenardier hoarsely, &quot;a pretty 
                lie!</p>
              <p> 　　You stick to that pleasantry, do you!</p>
              <p> 　　You're floundering, my old buck! Ah!</p>
              <p> 　　You don't remember!</p>
              <p> 　　You don't see who I am?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; said M. Leblanc with a politeness 
                of accent, which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and 
                powerful, &quot;I see that you are a villain!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess 
                a susceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish!</p>
              <p> 　　At this word &quot;villain,&quot; the female Thenardier sprang 
                from the bed, Thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about 
                to crush it in his hands. &quot;Don't you stir!&quot; he shouted 
                to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Villain!</p>
              <p> 　　Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop! 
                it's true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I 
                have no bread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! 
                It's three days since I have had anything to eat, so I'm a villain! 
                Ah! you folks warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have 
                wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor 
                in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus 
                at forty francs the bunch in the month of January, and green peas, 
                you gorge yourselves, and when you want to know whether it is 
                cold, you look in the papers to see what the engineer Chevalier's 
                thermometer says about it.</p>
              <p> 　　We, it is we who are thermometers. We don't need to go out 
                and look on the quay at the corner of the Tour de l'Horologe, 
                to find out the number of degrees of cold; we feel our blood congealing 
                in our veins, and the ice forming round our hearts, and we say:</p>
              <p> 　　`There is no God!'</p>
              <p> 　　And you come to our caverns, yes our caverns, for the purpose 
                of calling us villains! But we'll devour you!</p>
              <p> 　　But we'll devour you, poor little things! Just see here, Mister 
                millionnaire:</p>
              <p> 　　I have been a solid man, I have held a license, I have been 
                an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am!</p>
              <p> 　　And it's quite possible that you are not!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Here Thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near 
                the door, and added with a shudder:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;When I think that he has dared to come here and talk 
                to me like a cobbler!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist!</p>
              <p> 　　I'm not a suspicious character, not a bit of it!</p>
              <p> 　　I'm not a man whose name nobody knows, and who comes and abducts 
                children from houses! I'm an old French soldier, I ought to have 
                been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was!</p>
              <p> 　　And in the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I 
                don't know what.</p>
              <p> 　　He told me his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that 
                I didn't hear.</p>
              <p> 　　All I caught was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name 
                than his thanks. That would have helped me to find him again.</p>
              <p> 　　The picture that you see here, and which was painted by David 
                at Bruqueselles,--do you know what it represents?</p>
              <p> 　　It represents me.</p>
              <p> 　　David wished to immortalize that feat of prowess.</p>
              <p> 　　I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through 
                the grape-shot. There's the history of it! That general never 
                did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest!</p>
              <p> 　　But none the less, I saved his life at the risk of my own, 
                and I have the certificate of the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier 
                of Waterloo, by all the furies!</p>
              <p> 　　And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, 
                let's have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, 
                I must have an enormous lot of money, or I'll exterminate you, 
                by the thunder of the good God!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, 
                and was listening.</p>
              <p> 　　The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainly 
                was the Thenardier of the will.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed 
                against his father, and which he was on the point of so fatally 
                justifying.</p>
              <p> 　　His perplexity was redoubled.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his 
                accent, in his gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every 
                word, there was, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing 
                everything, in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of 
                pride and pettiness, of rage and folly, in that chaos of real 
                griefs and false sentiments, in that immodesty of a malicious 
                man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence, in that shameless 
                nudity of a repulsive soul, in that conflagration of all sufferings 
                combined with all hatreds, something which was as hideous as evil, 
                and as heart-rending as the truth.</p>
              <p> 　　The picture of the master, the painting by David which he 
                had proposed that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, 
                as the reader has divined, than the sign of his tavern painted, 
                as it will be remembered, by himself, the only relic which he 
                had preserved from his shipwreck at Montfermeil.</p>
              <p> 　　As he had ceased to intercept Marius' visual ray, Marius could 
                examine this thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize 
                a battle, a background of smoke, and a man carrying another man. 
                It was the group composed of Pontmercy and Thenardier; the sergeant 
                the rescuer, the colonel rescued.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored his father 
                to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the wine-shop 
                at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, a phantom 
                had risen there.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius heard his heart beating in his temples, he had the 
                cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely depicted 
                on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that 
                the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.</p>
              <p> 　　When Thenardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot 
                eyes on M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on 
                you?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc held his peace.</p>
              <p> 　　In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this 
                lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;If there's any wood to be split, I'm there!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face 
                made its appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited 
                not teeth, but fangs.</p>
              <p> 　　It was the face of the man with the butcher's axe.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Why have you taken off your mask?&quot; cried Thenardier 
                in a rage.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;For fun,&quot; retorted the man.</p>
              <p> 　　For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching 
                and following all the movements of Thenardier, who, blinded and 
                dazzled by his own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with 
                full confidence that the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed 
                man fast, he being armed himself, of being nine against one, supposing 
                that the female Thenardier counted for but one man.</p>
              <p> 　　During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned 
                his back to M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his 
                foot and the table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious 
                agility, before Thenardier had time to turn round, he had reached 
                the window. To open it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was 
                the work of a second only.</p>
              <p> 　　He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged 
                him back energetically into the hovel.</p>
              <p> 　　These were the three &quot;chimney-builders,&quot; who had 
                flung themselves upon him. At the same time the Thenardier woman 
                had wound her hands in his hair.</p>
              <p> 　　At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up 
                from the corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of 
                wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a stone-breaker's 
                hammer in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the &quot;chimney-builders,&quot; whose smirched face 
                was lighted up by the candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in 
                spite of his daubing, Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, 
                lifted above M. Leblanc's head a sort of bludgeon made of two 
                balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius could not resist this sight.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My father,&quot; he thought, &quot;forgive me!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.</p>
              <p> 　　The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardier's 
                voice shouted:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't harm him!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating 
                Thenardier, had calmed him.</p>
              <p> 　　There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and the adroit 
                man.</p>
              <p> 　　Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the presence 
                of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not stir, 
                the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and 
                tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper 
                hand.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't hurt him!&quot; he repeated, and without suspecting 
                it, his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being 
                discharged, and to paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency 
                of the case disappeared, and who, in the face of this new phase, 
                saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer.</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would 
                deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule's 
                father to perish, or of destroying the colonel's saviour?</p>
              <p> 　　A herculean struggle had begun.</p>
              <p> 　　With one blow full in the chest, M. Leblanc had sent the old 
                man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the room, then with two 
                backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants, 
                and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches were rattling 
                in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone; 
                but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms 
                and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over 
                the two &quot;chimney-builders&quot; on the floor.</p>
              <p> 　　Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing 
                those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring 
                in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, 
                M. Leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like 
                the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.</p>
              <p> 　　They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the 
                window, and there they held him in awe.</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Don't you mix yourself up in this affair,&quot; said 
                Thenardier. &quot;You'll tear your shawl.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, 
                with a growl.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Now,&quot; said Thenardier, &quot;search him, you other 
                fellows!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.</p>
              <p> 　　They searched him.</p>
              <p> 　　He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing 
                six francs, and his handkerchief.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What!</p>
              <p> 　　No pocket-book?&quot; he demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No, nor watch,&quot; replied one of the &quot;chimney-builders.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Never mind,&quot; murmured the masked man who carried 
                the big key, in the voice of a ventriloquist, &quot;he's a tough 
                old fellow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle 
                of ropes and threw them at the men.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Tie him to the leg of the bed,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched 
                across the room by the blow from M. Leblanc's fist, and who made 
                no movement, he added:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Is Boulatruelle dead?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Bigrenaille, &quot;he's drunk.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Sweep him into a corner,&quot; said Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　Two of the &quot;chimney-builders&quot; pushed the drunken 
                man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Babet,&quot; said Thenardier in a low tone to the man 
                with the cudgel, &quot;why did you bring so many; they were not 
                needed.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What can you do?&quot; replied the man with the cudgel, 
                &quot;they all wanted to be in it.</p>
              <p> 　　This is a bad season.</p>
              <p> 　　There's no business going on.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort 
                of hospital bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly 
                hewn.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc let them take their own course.</p>
              <p> 　　The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with 
                his feet on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was 
                most remote from the window, and nearest to the fireplace.</p>
              <p> 　　When the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair 
                and seated himself almost facing M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of 
                a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil 
                and cunning sweetness.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile 
                of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been 
                foaming but a moment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic 
                and alarming metamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who 
                should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur--&quot; said Thenardier.</p>
              <p> 　　And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept 
                their hands on M. Leblanc:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the 
                gentleman.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All retired towards the door.</p>
              <p> 　　He went on:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. 
                You might have broken your leg.</p>
              <p> 　　Now, if you will permit me, we will converse quietly.</p>
              <p> 　　In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation 
                which I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest 
                cry.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it 
                had escaped Marius in his agitation.</p>
              <p> 　　M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words, without raising 
                his voice, and even during his struggle with the six ruffians 
                near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular 
                silence.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier continued:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mon Dieu!</p>
              <p> 　　You might have shouted `stop thief' a bit, and I should not 
                have thought it improper.</p>
              <p> 　　`Murder!' That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as 
                I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part.</p>
              <p> 　　It is very natural that you should make a little row when 
                you find yourself with persons who don't inspire you with sufficient 
                confidence.</p>
              <p> 　　You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you 
                on that account.</p>
              <p> 　　You would not even have been gagged.</p>
              <p> 　　And I will tell you why.</p>
              <p> 　　This room is very private. That's its only recommendation, 
                but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and 
                it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station 
                as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, 
                and the thunder would make a pouf. It's a handy lodging.</p>
              <p> 　　But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so.</p>
              <p> 　　I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion 
                that I draw from that fact:</p>
              <p> 　　My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes?</p>
              <p> 　　The police.</p>
              <p> 　　And after the police? Justice.</p>
              <p> 　　Well!</p>
              <p> 　　You have not made an outcry; that is because you don't care 
                to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do. 
                It is because,--I have long suspected it,--you have some interest 
                in hiding something.</p>
              <p> 　　On our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an 
                understanding.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, who kept 
                his eyes fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp 
                points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of 
                his prisoner. Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a 
                sort of moderated, subdued insolence and crafty insolence, was 
                reserved and almost choice, and in that rascal, who had been nothing 
                but a robber a short time previously, one now felt &quot;the man 
                who had studied for the priesthood.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which 
                had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his 
                own life, that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, 
                which is to utter a cry, all this, it must be confessed, now that 
                his attention had been called to it, troubled Marius, and affected 
                him with painful astonishment.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier's well-grounded observation still further obscured 
                for Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular 
                person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur 
                Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, 
                half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon 
                him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in 
                the presence of Thenardier's wrath, as in the presence of his 
                sweetness, this man remained impassive; and Marius could not refrain 
                from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage.</p>
              <p> 　　Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, 
                and which did not know the meaning of despair.</p>
              <p> 　　Here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate 
                circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis, inevitable as was the 
                catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning 
                man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.</p>
              <p> 　　Thenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, 
                shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring 
                pallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in 
                which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and 
                spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars.</p>
              <p> 　　Then Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I continue,&quot; said he.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange this 
                matter in an amicable way.</p>
              <p> 　　I was wrong to lose my temper just now, I don't know what 
                I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I said extravagant 
                things.</p>
              <p> 　　For example, because you are a millionnaire, I told you that 
                I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money.</p>
              <p> 　　That would not be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, 
                you have expenses of your own-- who has not?</p>
              <p> 　　I don't want to ruin you, I am not a greedy fellow, after 
                all.</p>
              <p> 　　I am not one of those people who, because they have the advantage 
                of the position, profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous.</p>
              <p> 　　Why, I'm taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice 
                on my side.</p>
              <p> 　　I only want two hundred thousand francs.&quot;</p>

              <p> 　　RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE</p>
              <p> 　　 At every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled 
                from Marius' hair.</p>
              <p> 　　Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 
                6, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance 
                of the number on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker 
                of beaten iron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat 
                and a satyr confronting each other, he gave a violent peal. The 
                gate opened a little way and Javert gave it a push.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter half made his appearance yawning, vaguely awake, 
                and with a candle in his hand.</p>
              <p> 　　Everyone in the house was asleep.</p>
              <p> 　　People go to bed betimes in the Marais, especially on days 
                when there is a revolt.</p>
              <p> 　　This good, old quarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes 
                refuge in slumber, as children, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, 
                hide their heads hastily under their coverlet.</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius 
                out of the carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, 
                and the coachman under the knees.</p>
              <p> 　　As they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under 
                the latter's clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, 
                and assured himself that his heart was still beating.</p>
              <p> 　　It was even beating a little less feebly, as though the movement 
                of the carriage had brought about a certain fresh access of life.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, 
                and the presence of the porter of a factious person.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Some person whose name is Gillenormand?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Here.</p>
              <p> 　　What do you want with him?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His son is brought back.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His son?&quot; said the porter stupidly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He is dead.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Jean Valjean, who, soiled and tattered, stood behind Javert, 
                and whom the porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign 
                to him with his head that this was not so.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter did not appear to understand either Javert's words 
                or Jean Valjean's sign.</p>
              <p> 　　Javert continued:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He went to the barricade, and here he is.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;To the barricade?&quot; ejaculated the porter.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;He has got himself killed.</p>
              <p> 　　Go waken his father.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The porter did not stir.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Go along with you!&quot; repeated Javert.</p>
              <p> 　　And he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;There will be a funeral here to-morrow.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　For Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were 
                categorically classed, which is the beginning of foresight and 
                surveillance, and each contingency had its own compartment; all 
                possible facts were arranged in drawers, as it were, whence they 
                emerged on occasion, in variable quantities; in the street, uproar, 
                revolt, carnival, and funeral.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter contented himself with waking Basque.</p>
              <p> 　　Basque woke Nicolette; Nicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand.</p>
              <p> 　　As for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that 
                he would hear about the matter early enough in any case.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was carried up to the first floor, without any one 
                in the other parts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited 
                on an old sofa in M. Gillenormand's antechamber; and while Basque 
                went in search of a physician, and while Nicolette opened the 
                linen-presses, Jean Valjean felt Javert touch him on the shoulder. 
                He understood and descended the stairs, having behind him the 
                step of Javert who was following him.</p>
              <p> 　　The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched 
                their arrival, in terrified somnolence.</p>
              <p> 　　They entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted 
                his box.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Inspector Javert,&quot; said Jean, &quot;grant me yet 
                another favor.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; demanded Javert roughly.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Let me go home for one instant.</p>
              <p> 　　Then you shall do whatever you like with me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Javert remained silent for a few moments, with his chin drawn 
                back into the collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass 
                and front:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Driver,&quot; said he, &quot;Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 
                7.&quot;</p>

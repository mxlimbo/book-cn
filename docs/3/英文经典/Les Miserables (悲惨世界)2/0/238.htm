              <p> 　　FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS</p>
              <p> 　　 The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century 
                had become extraordinary and charming.</p>
              <p> 　　The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it, without 
                a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant 
                depths.</p>
              <p> 　　More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts 
                and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that 
                ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two green 
                and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of 
                undecipherable arabesque.</p>
              <p> 　　There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues, 
                several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting 
                on the wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough 
                grass everywhere.</p>
              <p> 　　Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned.</p>
              <p> 　　Weeds abounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor 
                corner of land.</p>
              <p> 　　The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things 
                towards life; venerable growth reigned there among them.</p>
              <p> 　　The trees had bent over towards the nettles, the plant had 
                sprung upward, the branch had inclined, that which crawls on the 
                earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air, that 
                which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails 
                in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, 
                shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed, married, confounded 
                themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep and close embrace, 
                had celebrated and accomplished there, under the well-pleased 
                eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet square, 
                the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity. 
                This garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, 
                that is to say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled 
                as a city, quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant 
                like a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a throng.</p>
              <p> 　　In Floreal[34] this enormous thicket, free behind its gate 
                and within its four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, 
                quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks 
                in the breaths of cosmic love, and which feels the sap of April 
                rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous 
                wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced 
                statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the 
                pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew like 
                pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes.</p>
              <p> 　　At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, 
                and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling 
                about there in flakes amid the shade.</p>
              <p> 　　There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a throng of innocent 
                voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the twittering forgot 
                to say the humming completed.</p>
              <p> 　　In the evening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and 
                enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered 
                it; the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus 
                poured out from every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle 
                poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were 
                audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt the sacred 
                intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice 
                the leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.</p>
              <p> 　　 [34] From April 19 to May 20.</p>
              <p> 　　 In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, 
                and allowed some glimpse of the house.</p>
              <p> 　　Instead of flowers on the branches <br>
                and dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails 
                were visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in 
                any fashion, under any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, 
                summer, autumn, this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, 
                contemplation, solitude, liberty, the absence of man, the presence 
                of God; and the rusty old gate had the air of saying:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;This garden belongs to me.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there 
                on every side, the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes 
                a couple of paces away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, 
                the Chamber of Deputies not far off; the carriages of the Rue 
                de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, 
                in vain, in the vicinity, in vain did the yellow, brown, white, 
                and red omnibuses cross each other's course at the neighboring 
                cross-roads; the Rue Plumet was the desert; and the death of the 
                former proprietors, the revolution which had passed over it, the 
                crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty 
                years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to 
                this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, 
                great crimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, 
                beetles, uneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from 
                the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls 
                a certain indescribable and savage grandeur; and for nature, which 
                disconcerts the petty arrangements of man, and which sheds herself 
                always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant 
                as well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian 
                garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest 
                of the New World.</p>
              <p> 　　Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound 
                and penetrating influence of nature knows this.</p>
              <p> 　　Although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy, 
                either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect, the contemplator 
                falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions 
                of force terminating in unity.</p>
              <p> 　　Everything toils at everything.</p>
              <p> 　　Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star 
                profits the rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the 
                perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations.</p>
              <p> 　　Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule?</p>
              <p> 　　How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined 
                by the fall of grains of sand?</p>
              <p> 　　Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great 
                and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causes in the 
                precipices of being, and the avalanches of creation?</p>
              <p> 　　The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, the 
                little is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming 
                vision for the mind.</p>
              <p> 　　There are marvellous relations between beings and things; 
                in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing 
                despises the other; all have need of each other.</p>
              <p> 　　The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the 
                azure depths, without knowing what it is doing; the night distributes 
                stellar essences to the sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have 
                round their leg the thread of the infinite. Germination is complicated 
                with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow 
                cracking its egg, and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm 
                and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope 
                begins.</p>
              <p> 　　Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision?</p>
              <p> 　　Choose.</p>
              <p> 　　A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill 
                of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, 
                exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of 
                substance. Elements and principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply 
                with each other, to such a point that the material and the moral 
                world are brought eventually to the same clearness.</p>
              <p> 　　The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself.</p>
              <p> 　　In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes 
                in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible mystery 
                of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream, 
                not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to 
                bits a planet there, oscillating and winding, making of light 
                a force and of thought an element, disseminated and invisible, 
                dissolving all, except that geometrical point, the I; bringing 
                everything back to the soul-atom; expanding everything in God, 
                entangling all activity, from summit to base, in the obscurity 
                of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the flight of an insect to the 
                movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows?</p>
              <p> 　　Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of 
                the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in 
                the drop of water.</p>
              <p> 　　A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor 
                of which is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.</p>

              <p> 　　TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS:</p>
              <p> 　　TWO FRANCS AN HOUR</p>
              <p> 　　Marius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in 
                reality, had seen nothing.</p>
              <p> 　　His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart had, 
                so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment 
                of her very first step in that garret.</p>
              <p> 　　During her entire stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy 
                which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole 
                soul on a single point. He contemplated, not that girl, but that 
                light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet.</p>
              <p> 　　The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would 
                not have been any more dazzled.</p>
              <p> 　　While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding 
                the clothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, 
                and the little injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, 
                he sought to catch her words.</p>
              <p> 　　He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, her walk, 
                he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that 
                he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely 
                sure of the fact.</p>
              <p> 　　He would have given ten years of his life to hear it, in order 
                that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music.</p>
              <p> 　　But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations 
                and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine 
                wrath to Marius' ecstasy.</p>
              <p> 　　He devoured her with his eyes.</p>
              <p> 　　He could not believe that it really was that divine creature 
                whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous 
                lair.</p>
              <p> 　　It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in the midst 
                of toads.</p>
              <p> 　　When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow 
                her, to cling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where 
                she lived, not to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously 
                re-discovered her.</p>
              <p> 　　He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat.</p>
              <p> 　　As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the 
                point of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. 
                The corridor was long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, 
                M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on 
                turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase, he were to 
                catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently, 
                take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this 
                time it would be final.</p>
              <p> 　　What was he to do?</p>
              <p> 　　Should he wait a little?</p>
              <p> 　　But while he was waiting, the carriage might drive off.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and quitted 
                his room.</p>
              <p> 　　There was no one in the corridor.</p>
              <p> 　　He hastened to the stairs. There was no one on the staircase.</p>
              <p> 　　He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevard in time 
                to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, 
                on its way back to Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius rushed headlong in that direction.</p>
              <p> 　　On arriving at the angle of the boulevard, he caught sight 
                of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the Rue Mouffetard; the 
                carriage was already a long way off, and there was no means of 
                overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and besides, the 
                people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running 
                at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would recognize 
                him.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck, Marius 
                perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard.</p>
              <p> 　　There was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab 
                and follow the fiacre.</p>
              <p> 　　That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:--</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;By the hour?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was 
                destitute of buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits 
                on the bosom.</p>
              <p> 　　The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, 
                rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;What is it?&quot; said Marius.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Pay in advance,&quot; said the coachman.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How much?&quot; he demanded.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Forty sous.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I will pay on my return.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse 
                and to whip up his horse.</p>
              <p> 　　Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered 
                air. For the lack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, 
                his happiness, his love!</p>
              <p> 　　He had seen, and he was becoming blind again.</p>
              <p> 　　He reflected bitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound 
                regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, that very morning, 
                on that miserable girl.</p>
              <p> 　　If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, 
                he would have been born again, he would have emerged from the 
                limbo and darkness, he would have made his escape from isolation 
                and spleen, from his widowed state; he might have re-knotted the 
                black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread, which 
                had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant, 
                once more!</p>
              <p> 　　He returned to his hovel in despair.</p>
              <p> 　　He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to 
                return in the evening, and that all he had to do was to set about 
                the matter more skilfully, so that he might follow him on that 
                occasion; but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he 
                had heard this.</p>
              <p> 　　As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, 
                on the other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting 
                the Rue De la Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the 
                &quot;philanthropist's&quot; great-coat, engaged in conversation 
                with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed 
                by common consent, prowlers of the barriers; people of equivocal 
                face, of suspicious monologues, who present the air of having 
                evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, which suggests 
                the supposition that they work by night.</p>
              <p> 　　These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, 
                in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that 
                a policeman would surely have observed, but which Marius hardly 
                noticed.</p>
              <p> 　　Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not 
                refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers 
                with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, 
                alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once 
                pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. This 
                man's name the reader has learned in the preceding book. This 
                Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later on 
                in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was 
                at that time only a famous rascal.</p>
              <p> 　　To-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians 
                and assassins.</p>
              <p> 　　He was at the head of a school towards the end of the last 
                reign.</p>
              <p> 　　And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups 
                form and talk in whispers, he was discussed at La Force in the 
                Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely at 
                the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, 
                in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under 
                the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his 
                own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts 
                at flight.</p>
              <p> 　　In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had 
                not as yet made a serious beginning.</p>

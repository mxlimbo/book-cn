              <p> 　　WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESS</p>
              <p> 　　 Courfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued 
                to insult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of 
                projectiles which is called grape-shot passed overhead with its 
                terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, 
                you pain me, you are wasting your row.</p>
              <p> 　　That's not thunder, it's a cough.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And the bystanders laughed.</p>
              <p> 　　Courfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with 
                the peril, like Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry, 
                and, as wine was lacking, they poured out gayety to all.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I admire Enjolras,&quot; said Bossuet.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;His impassive temerity astounds me.</p>
              <p> 　　He lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps; Enjolras 
                complains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. The 
                rest of us have mistresses, more or less, who make us crazy, that 
                is to say, brave.</p>
              <p> 　　When a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least that he 
                can do is to fight like a lion.</p>
              <p> 　　That is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that 
                mesdames our grisettes play on us.</p>
              <p> 　　Roland gets himself killed for Angelique; all our heroism 
                comes from our women.</p>
              <p> 　　A man without a woman is a pistol without a trigger; it is 
                the woman that sets the man off.</p>
              <p> 　　Well, Enjolras has no woman.</p>
              <p> 　　He is not in love, and yet he manages to be intrepid. It is 
                a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice and as 
                bold as fire.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been 
                near him, that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Patria.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Bossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;News!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, 
                he added:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;My name is Eight-Pounder.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene.</p>
              <p> 　　This was a second piece of ordnance.</p>
              <p> 　　The artillery-men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force 
                and placed this second piece in line with the first.</p>
              <p> 　　This outlined the catastrophe.</p>
              <p> 　　A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were 
                firing point-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line 
                and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.</p>
              <p> 　　Another cannonade was audible at some distance.</p>
              <p> 　　At the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking 
                the redoubt from the Rue de la Chanvrerie, two other cannons, 
                trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis, the other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, 
                were riddling the Saint-Merry barricade.</p>
              <p> 　　The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.</p>
              <p> 　　The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.</p>
              <p> 　　One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade 
                on the Rue de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.</p>
              <p> 　　The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, 
                and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme 
                edge of the upper crest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone 
                down upon the insurgents, mingled with bursts of grape-shot.</p>
              <p> 　　The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents 
                from the summit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close 
                in the interior, that is to say, this announced the assault.</p>
              <p> 　　The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade 
                by balls, and from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the 
                attacking columns could venture into the street without being 
                picked off, perhaps, even, without being seen, could briskly and 
                suddenly scale the redoubt, as on the preceding evening, and, 
                who knows? take it by surprise.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of 
                those guns should be diminished,&quot; said Enjolras, and he shouted:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Fire on the artillery-men!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　All were ready.</p>
              <p> 　　The barricade, which had long been silent, poured forth a 
                desperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed, with a sort 
                of rage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, 
                at the end of a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked with 
                flame, two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying 
                beneath the wheels of the cannons.</p>
              <p> 　　Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces 
                with severe tranquillity, but the fire had slackened.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Things are going well now,&quot; said Bossuet to Enjolras.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Success.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　Enjolras shook his head and replied:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there 
                will not be any cartridges left in the barricade.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.</p>

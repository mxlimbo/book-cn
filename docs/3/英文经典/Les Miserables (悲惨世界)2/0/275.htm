                POETRY. THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY </p>
              <p> 　　At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock 
                of the populace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started 
                a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which 
                was following the hearse and which, through the whole length of 
                the boulevards, weighed, so to speak, on the head of the procession, 
                there arose a frightful ebb.</p>
              <p> 　　The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, 
                made their escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the 
                pallor of flight. The great river which covered the boulevards 
                divided in a twinkling, overflowed to right and left, and spread 
                in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of 
                a sewer that has broken loose.</p>
              <p> 　　At that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through 
                the Rue Menilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming 
                laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, 
                caught sight of an old holster-pistol in the show-window of a 
                bric-a-brac merchant's shop.</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Mother What's-your-name, I'm going to borrow your machine.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　And off he ran with the pistol.</p>
              <p> 　　Two minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were 
                fleeing through the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered 
                the lad brandishing his pistol and singing:-- La nuit on ne voit 
                rien, </p>
              <p> 　　 Le jour on voit tres bien, </p>
              <p> 　　 D'un ecrit apocrypha </p>
              <p> 　　 Le bourgeois s'ebouriffe, </p>
              <p> 　　 Pratiquez la vertu, </p>
              <p> 　　 Tutu, chapeau pointu![44]</p>
              <p> 　　 [44] At night one sees nothing, by day one sees very well; 
                the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl, practice 
                virtue, tutu, pointed hat!</p>
              <p> 　　 It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.</p>
              <p> 　　On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.</p>
              <p> 　　Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate 
                his march, and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing 
                on occasion? We know not.</p>
              <p> 　　Who does know?</p>
              <p> 　　Himself, perhaps.</p>
              <p> 　　However, Gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in 
                circulation, and he mingled with them his own chirpings.</p>
              <p> 　　An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of the 
                voices of nature and the voices of Paris.</p>
              <p> 　　He combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory 
                of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous 
                to his own. He had, it appears, been for three months apprenticed 
                to a printer. He had one day executed a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, 
                one of the Forty.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche was a gamin of letters.</p>
              <p> 　　Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when 
                he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on 
                that villainously rainy night, it was to his own brothers that 
                he had played the part of Providence.</p>
              <p> 　　His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning; that 
                is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets 
                at daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically 
                extracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort 
                of breakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confiding 
                them to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, 
                almost entirely.</p>
              <p> 　　On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same 
                spot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of 
                a farewell:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, 
                or, as they say at the court, I file off.</p>
              <p> 　　If you don't find papa and mamma, young 'uns, come back here 
                this evening.</p>
              <p> 　　I'll scramble you up some supper, and I'll give you a shakedown.&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　The two children, picked up by some policeman and placed in 
                the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank, or having simply strayed 
                off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, did not return.</p>
              <p> 　　The lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these 
                lost traces.</p>
              <p> 　　Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks had elapsed 
                since that night.</p>
              <p> 　　More than once he had scratched the back of his head and said:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Where the devil are my two children?&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue 
                du Pont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open 
                in that street, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a 
                pastry-cook's shop.</p>
              <p> 　　This presented a providential occasion to eat another apple-turnover 
                before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in his fob, 
                turned his pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou, and 
                began to shout:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;Help!&quot;</p>
              <p> 　　It is hard to miss the last cake.</p>
              <p> 　　Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.</p>
              <p> 　　Two minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing 
                the Rue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss 
                of the apple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged 
                himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters 
                in broad daylight.</p>
              <p> 　　A little further on, on catching sight of a group of comfortable-looking 
                persons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he shrugged his 
                shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical 
                bile as they passed:</p>
              <p> 　　&quot;How fat those moneyed men are!</p>
              <p> 　　They're drunk!</p>
              <p> 　　They just wallow in good dinners.</p>
              <p> 　　Ask 'em what they do with their money. They don't know.</p>
              <p> 　　They eat it, that's what they do!</p>
              <p> 　　As much as their bellies will hold.&quot;</p>

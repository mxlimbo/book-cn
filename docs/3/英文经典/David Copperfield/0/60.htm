            <p>　　 I landed in London on a wintry autumn evening. It was dark and 
              raining, and I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen 
              in a year. I walked from the Custom House to the Monument before 
              I found a coach; and although the very house-fronts, looking on 
              the swollen gutters, were like old friends to me, I could not but 
              admit that they were very dingy friends. </p>
            <p>　　I have often remarked - I suppose everybody has - that one's 
              going away from a familiar place, would seem to be the signal for 
              change in it. As I looked out of the coach window, and observed 
              that an old house on Fish-street Hill, which had stood untouched 
              by painter, carpenter, or bricklayer, for a century, had been pulled 
              down in my absence; and that a neighbouring street, of time-honoured 
              insalubrity and inconvenience, was being drained and widened; I 
              half expected to find St. Paul's Cathedral looking older. </p>
            <p>　　For some changes in the fortunes of my friends, I was prepared. 
              My aunt had long been re-established at Dover, and Traddles had 
              begun to get into some little practice at the Bar, in the very first 
              term after my departure. He had chambers in Gray's Inn, now; and 
              had told me, in his last letters, that he was not without hopes 
              of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world. </p>
            <p>　　They expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my 
              returning so soon. I had purposely misled them, that I might have 
              the pleasure of taking them by surprise. And yet, I was perverse 
              enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome, 
              and rattling, alone and silent, through the misty streets. </p>
            <p>　　The well-known shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did 
              something for me; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray's 
              Inn Coffee-house, I had recovered my spirits. It recalled, at first, 
              that so-different time when I had put up at the Golden Cross, and 
              reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then; but 
              that was natural. </p>
            <p>　　'Do you know where Mr. Traddles lives in the Inn?' I asked the 
              waiter, as I warmed myself by the coffee-room fire. </p>
            <p>　　'Holborn Court, sir. Number two.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers, I believe?' 
              said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' returned the waiter, 'probably he has, sir; but 
              I am not aware of it myself.' </p>
            <p>　　This waiter, who was middle-aged and spare, looked for help to 
              a waiter of more authority - a stout, potential old man, with a 
              double chin, in black breeches and stockings, who came out of a 
              place like a churchwarden's pew, at the end of the coffee-room, 
              where he kept company with a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, 
              and other books and papers. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Traddles,' said the spare waiter. 'Number two in the Court.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　The potential waiter waved him away, and turned, gravely, to 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　'I was inquiring,' said I, 'whether Mr. Traddles, at number two 
              in the Court, has not a rising reputation among the lawyers?' </p>
            <p>　　'Never heard his name,' said the waiter, in a rich husky voice. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I felt quite apologetic for Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'He's a young man, sure?' said the portentous waiter, fixing 
              his eyes severely on me. 'How long has he been in the Inn?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not above three years,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　The waiter, who I supposed had lived in his churchwarden's pew 
              for forty years, could not pursue such an insignificant subject. 
              He asked me what I would have for dinner? </p>
            <p>　　I felt I was in England again, and really was quite cast down 
              on Traddles's account. There seemed to be no hope for him. I meekly 
              ordered a bit of fish and a steak, and stood before the fire musing 
              on his obscurity. </p>
            <p>　　As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes, I could not help 
              thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the 
              flower he was, was an arduous place to rise in. It had such a prescriptive, 
              stiff-necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air. I glanced about 
              the room, which had had its sanded floor sanded, no doubt, in exactly 
              the same manner when the chief waiter was a boy - if he ever was 
              a boy, which appeared improbable; and at the shining tables, where 
              I saw myself reflected, in unruffled depths of old mahogany; and 
              at the lamps, without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning; and 
              at the comfortable green curtains, with their pure brass rods, snugly 
              enclosing the boxes; and at the two large coal fires, brightly burning; 
              and at the rows of decanters, burly as if with the consciousness 
              of pipes of expensive old port wine below; and both England, and 
              the law, appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken 
              by storm. I went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes; and 
              the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment (which was over 
              the archway leading to the Inn, I remember), and the sedate immensity 
              of the four-post bedstead, and the indomitable gravity of the chests 
              of drawers, all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes 
              of Traddles, or on any such daring youth. I came down again to my 
              dinner; and even the slow comfort of the meal, and the orderly silence 
              of the place - which was bare of guests, the Long Vacation not yet 
              being over - were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles, and his 
              small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come. </p>
            <p>　　I had seen nothing like this since I went away, and it quite 
              dashed my hopes for my friend. The chief waiter had had enough of 
              me. He came near me no more; but devoted himself to an old gentleman 
              in long gaiters, to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come 
              out of the cellar of its own accord, for he gave no order. The second 
              waiter informed me, in a whisper, that this old gentleman was a 
              retired conveyancer living in the Square, and worth a mint of money, 
              which it was expected he would leave to his laundress's daughter; 
              likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in 
              a bureau, all tarnished with lying by, though more than one spoon 
              and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision. 
              By this time, I quite gave Traddles up for lost; and settled in 
              my own mind that there was no hope for him. </p>
            <p>　　Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow, nevertheless, 
              I dispatched my dinner, in a manner not at all calculated to raise 
              me in the opinion of the chief waiter, and hurried out by the back 
              way. Number two in the Court was soon reached; and an inscription 
              on the door-post informing me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of 
              chambers on the top storey, I ascended the staircase. A crazy old 
              staircase I found it to be, feebly lighted on each landing by a 
              club- headed little oil wick, dying away in a little dungeon of 
              dirty glass. </p>
            <p>　　In the course of my stumbling upstairs, I fancied I heard a pleasant 
              sound of laughter; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister, 
              or attorney's clerk or barrister's clerk, but of two or three merry 
              girls. Happening, however, as I stopped to listen, to put my foot 
              in a hole where the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn had left a 
              plank deficient, I fell down with some noise, and when I recovered 
              my footing all was silent. </p>
            <p>　　Groping my way more carefully, for the rest of the journey, my 
              heart beat high when I found the outer door, which had Mr. TRADDLES 
              painted on it, open. I knocked. A considerable scuffling within 
              ensued, but nothing else. I therefore knocked again. </p>
            <p>　　A small sharp-looking lad, half-footboy and half-clerk, who was 
              very much out of breath, but who looked at me as if he defied me 
              to prove it legally, presented himself. </p>
            <p>　　'Is Mr. Traddles within?' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, sir, but he's engaged.' </p>
            <p>　　'I want to see him.' </p>
            <p>　　After a moment's survey of me, the sharp-looking lad decided 
              to let me in; and opening the door wider for that purpose, admitted 
              me, first, into a little closet of a hall, and next into a little 
              sitting-room; where I came into the presence of my old friend (also 
              out of breath), seated at a table, and bending over papers. </p>
            <p>　　'Good God!' cried Traddles, looking up. 'It's Copperfield!' and 
              rushed into my arms, where I held him tight. </p>
            <p>　　'All well, my dear Traddles?' </p>
            <p>　　'All well, my dear, dear Copperfield, and nothing but good news!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　We cried with pleasure, both of us. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear fellow,' said Traddles, rumpling his hair in his excitement, 
              which was a most unnecessary operation, 'my dearest Copperfield, 
              my long-lost and most welcome friend, how glad I am to see you! 
              How brown you are! How glad I am! Upon my life and honour, I never 
              was so rejoiced, my beloved Copperfield, never!' </p>
            <p>　　I was equally at a loss to express my emotions. I was quite unable 
              to speak, at first. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear fellow!' said Traddles. 'And grown so famous! My glorious 
              Copperfield! Good gracious me, WHEN did you come, WHERE have you 
              come from, WHAT have you been doing?' </p>
            <p>　　Never pausing for an answer to anything he said, Traddles, who 
              had clapped me into an easy-chair by the fire, all this time impetuously 
              stirred the fire with one hand, and pulled at my neck-kerchief with 
              the other, under some wild delusion that it was a great-coat. Without 
              putting down the poker, he now hugged me again; and I hugged him; 
              and, both laughing, and both wiping our eyes, we both sat down, 
              and shook hands across the hearth. </p>
            <p>　　'To think,' said Traddles, 'that you should have been so nearly 
              coming home as you must have been, my dear old boy, and not at the 
              ceremony!' </p>
            <p>　　'What ceremony, my dear Traddles?' </p>
            <p>　　'Good gracious me!' cried Traddles, opening his eyes in his old 
              way. 'Didn't you get my last letter?' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly not, if it referred to any ceremony.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, sticking his hair 
              upright with both hands, and then putting his hands on my knees, 
              'I am married!' </p>
            <p>　　'Married!' I cried joyfully. </p>
            <p>　　'Lord bless me, yes,!' said Traddles - 'by the Reverend Horace 
              - to Sophy - down in Devonshire. Why, my dear boy, she's behind 
              the window curtain! Look here!' </p>
            <p>　　To my amazement, the dearest girl in the world came at that same 
              instant, laughing and blushing, from her place of concealment. And 
              a more cheerful, amiable, honest, happy, bright-looking bride, I 
              believe (as I could not help saying on the spot) the world never 
              saw. I kissed her as an old acquaintance should, and wished them 
              joy with all my might of heart. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me,' said Traddles, 'what a delightful re-union this is! 
              You are so extremely brown, my dear Copperfield! God bless my soul, 
              how happy I am!' </p>
            <p>　　'And so am I,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'And I am sure I am!' said the blushing and laughing Sophy. </p>
            <p>　　'We are all as happy as possible!' said Traddles. 'Even the girls 
              are happy. Dear me, I declare I forgot them!' </p>
            <p>　　'Forgot?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'The girls,' said Traddles. 'Sophy's sisters. They are staying 
              with us. They have come to have a peep at London. The fact is, when 
              - was it you that tumbled upstairs, Copperfield?' </p>
            <p>　　'It was,' said I, laughing. </p>
            <p>　　'Well then, when you tumbled upstairs,' said Traddles, 'I was 
              romping with the girls. In point of fact, we were playing at Puss 
              in the Corner. But as that wouldn't do in Westminster Hall, and 
              as it wouldn't look quite professional if they were seen by a client, 
              they decamped. And they are now - listening, I have no doubt,' said 
              Traddles, glancing at the door of another room. </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry,' said I, laughing afresh, 'to have occasioned such 
              a dispersion.' </p>
            <p>　　'Upon my word,' rejoined Traddles, greatly delighted, 'if you 
              had seen them running away, and running back again, after you had 
              knocked, to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair, 
              and going on in the maddest manner, you wouldn't have said so. My 
              love, will you fetch the girls?' </p>
            <p>　　Sophy tripped away, and we heard her received in the adjoining 
              room with a peal of laughter. </p>
            <p>　　'Really musical, isn't it, my dear Copperfield?' said Traddles. 
              'It's very agreeable to hear. It quite lights up these old rooms. 
              To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his 
              life, you know, it's positively delicious. It's charming. Poor things, 
              they have had a great loss in Sophy - who, I do assure you, Copperfield 
              is, and ever was, the dearest girl! - and it gratifies me beyond 
              expression to find them in such good spirits. The society of girls 
              is a very delightful thing, Copperfield. It's not professional, 
              but it's very delightful.' </p>
            <p>　　Observing that he slightly faltered, and comprehending that in 
              the goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain 
              by what he had said, I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness 
              that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly. </p>
            <p>　　'But then,' said Traddles, 'our domestic arrangements are, to 
              say the truth, quite unprofessional altogether, my dear Copperfield. 
              Even Sophy's being here, is unprofessional. And we have no other 
              place of abode. We have put to sea in a cockboat, but we are quite 
              prepared to rough it. And Sophy's an extraordinary manager! You'll 
              be surprised how those girls are stowed away. I am sure I hardly 
              know how it's done!' </p>
            <p>　　'Are many of the young ladies with you?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'The eldest, the Beauty is here,' said Traddles, in a low confidential 
              voice, 'Caroline. And Sarah's here - the one I mentioned to you 
              as having something the matter with her spine, you know. Immensely 
              better! And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And 
              Louisa's here.' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed!' cried I. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said Traddles. 'Now the whole set - I mean the chambers 
              - is only three rooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most 
              wonderful way, and they sleep as comfortably as possible. Three 
              in that room,' said Traddles, pointing. 'Two in that.' </p>
            <p>　　I could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation 
              remaining for Mr. and Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me. </p>
            <p>　　'Well!' said Traddles, 'we are prepared to rough it, as I said 
              just now, and we did improvise a bed last week, upon the floor here. 
              But there's a little room in the roof - a very nice room, when you're 
              up there - which Sophy papered herself, to surprise me; and that's 
              our room at present. It's a capital little gipsy sort of place. 
              There's quite a view from it.' </p>
            <p>　　'And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!' said 
              I. 'How rejoiced I am!' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, as we shook 
              hands once more. 'Yes, I am as happy as it's possible to be. There's 
              your old friend, you see,' said Traddles, nodding triumphantly at 
              the flower-pot and stand; 'and there's the table with the marble 
              top! All the other furniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. 
              And as to plate, Lord bless you, we haven't so much as a tea-spoon.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'All to be earned?' said I, cheerfully. </p>
            <p>　　'Exactly so,' replied Traddles, 'all to be earned. Of course 
              we have something in the shape of tea-spoons, because we stir our 
              tea. But they're Britannia metal.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　'The silver will be the brighter when it comes,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'The very thing we say!' cried Traddles. 'You see, my dear Copperfield,' 
              falling again into the low confidential tone, 'after I had delivered 
              my argument in DOE dem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, which did me great 
              service with the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and had 
              some serious conversation in private with the Reverend Horace. I 
              dwelt upon the fact that Sophy - who I do assure you, Copperfield, 
              is the dearest girl! -' </p>
            <p>　　'I am certain she is!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'She is, indeed!' rejoined Traddles. 'But I am afraid I am wandering 
              from the subject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace?' </p>
            <p>　　'You said that you dwelt upon the fact -' </p>
            <p>　　'True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a 
              long period, and that Sophy, with the permission of her parents, 
              was more than content to take me - in short,' said Traddles, with 
              his old frank smile, 'on our present Britannia-metal footing. Very 
              well. I then proposed to the Reverend Horace - who is a most excellent 
              clergyman, Copperfield, and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought 
              to have enough to live upon, without pinching himself - that if 
              I could turn the corner, say of two hundred and fifty pounds, in 
              one year; and could see my way pretty clearly to that, or something 
              better, next year; and could plainly furnish a little place like 
              this, besides; then, and in that case, Sophy and I should be united. 
              I took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for 
              a good many years; and that the circumstance of Sophy's being extraordinarily 
              useful at home, ought not to operate with her affectionate parents, 
              against her establishment in life - don't you see?' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly it ought not,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I am glad you think so, Copperfield,' rejoined Traddles, 'because, 
              without any imputation on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents, 
              and brothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in such 
              cases. Well! I also pointed out, that my most earnest desire was, 
              to be useful to the family; and that if I got on in the world, and 
              anything should happen to him - I refer to the Reverend Horace -' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I understand,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'- Or to Mrs. Crewler - it would be the utmost gratification 
              of my wishes, to be a parent to the girls. He replied in a most 
              admirable manner, exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and undertook 
              to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement. They 
              had a dreadful time of it with her. It mounted from her legs into 
              her chest, and then into her head -' </p>
            <p>　　'What mounted?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Her grief,' replied Traddles, with a serious look. 'Her feelings 
              generally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior 
              woman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass 
              her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted 
              to the chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the 
              whole system in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her 
              through it by unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were 
              married yesterday six weeks. You have no idea what a Monster I felt, 
              Copperfield, when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away 
              in every direction! Mrs. Crewler couldn't see me before we left 
              - couldn't forgive me, then, for depriving her of her child - but 
              she is a good creature, and has done so since. I had a delightful 
              letter from her, only this morning.' </p>
            <p>　　'And in short, my dear friend,' said I, 'you feel as blest as 
              you deserve to feel!' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! That's your partiality!' laughed Traddles. 'But, indeed, 
              I am in a most enviable state. I work hard, and read Law insatiably. 
              I get up at five every morning, and don't mind it at all. I hide 
              the girls in the daytime, and make merry with them in the evening. 
              And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday, 
              which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term. But here,' 
              said Traddles, breaking off in his confidence, and speaking aloud, 
              'ARE the girls! Mr. Copperfield, Miss Crewler - Miss Sarah - Miss 
              Louisa - Margaret and Lucy!' </p>
            <p>　　They were a perfect nest of roses; they looked so wholesome and 
              fresh. They were all pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; 
              but there was a loving, cheerful, fireside quality in Sophy's bright 
              looks, which was better than that, and which assured me that my 
              friend had chosen well. We all sat round the fire; while the sharp 
              boy, who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers 
              out, cleared them away again, and produced the tea-things. After 
              that, he retired for the night, shutting the outer door upon us 
              with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasure and composure 
              beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea, then quietly 
              made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire. </p>
            <p>　　She had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. 'Tom' 
              had taken her down into Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had 
              seen my aunt, too; and both my aunt and Agnes were well, and they 
              had all talked of nothing but me. 'Tom' had never had me out of 
              his thoughts, she really believed, all the time I had been away. 
              'Tom' was the authority for everything. 'Tom' was evidently the 
              idol of her life; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion; 
              always to be believed in, and done homage to with the whole faith 
              of her heart, come what might. </p>
            <p>　　The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the 
              Beauty, pleased me very much. I don't know that I thought it very 
              reasonable; but I thought it very delightful, and essentially a 
              part of their character. If Traddles ever for an instant missed 
              the tea-spoons that were still to be won, I have no doubt it was 
              when he handed the Beauty her tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could 
              have got up any self-assertion against anyone, I am satisfied it 
              could only have been because she was the Beauty's sister. A few 
              slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner, which 
              I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly considered, by Traddles 
              and his wife, as her birthright and natural endowment. If she had 
              been born a Queen Bee, and they labouring Bees, they could not have 
              been more satisfied of that. </p>
            <p>　　But their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these 
              girls, and their submission of themselves to all their whims, was 
              the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have 
              desired to see. If Traddles were addressed as 'a darling', once 
              in the course of that evening; and besought to bring something here, 
              or carry something there, or take something up, or put something 
              down, or find something, or fetch something, he was so addressed, 
              by one or other of his sisters-in-law, at least twelve times in 
              an hour. Neither could they do anything without Sophy. Somebody's 
              hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up. Somebody forgot 
              how a particular tune went, and nobody but Sophy could hum that 
              tune right. Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in Devonshire, 
              and only Sophy knew it. Something was wanted to be written home, 
              and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the 
              morning. Somebody broke down in a piece of knitting, and no one 
              but Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction. 
              They were entire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and Traddles 
              waited on them. How many children Sophy could have taken care of 
              in her time, I can't imagine; but she seemed to be famous for knowing 
              every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the English 
              tongue; and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice 
              in the world, one after another (every sister issuing directions 
              for a different tune, and the Beauty generally striking in last), 
              so that I was quite fascinated. The best of all was, that, in the 
              midst of their exactions, all the sisters had a great tenderness 
              and respect both for Sophy and Traddles. I am sure, when I took 
              my leave, and Traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffee-house, 
              I thought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair, or any other 
              head of hair, rolling about in such a shower of kisses. </p>
            <p>　　Altogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with 
              pleasure, for a long time after I got back and had wished Traddles 
              good night. If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set 
              of chambers, in that withered Gray's Inn, they could not have brightened 
              it half so much. The idea of those Devonshire girls, among the dry 
              law-stationers and the attorneys' offices; and of the tea and toast, 
              and children's songs, in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, 
              red-tape, dusty wafers, ink-jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, 
              writs, declarations, and bills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly 
              fanciful as if I had dreamed that the Sultan's famous family had 
              been admitted on the roll of attorneys, and had brought the talking 
              bird, the singing tree, and the golden water into Gray's Inn Hall. 
              Somehow, I found that I had taken leave of Traddles for the night, 
              and come back to the coffee-house, with a great change in my despondency 
              about him. I began to think he would get on, in spite of all the 
              many orders of chief waiters in England. </p>
            <p>　　Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think 
              about him at my leisure, I gradually fell from the consideration 
              of his happiness to tracing prospects in the live-coals, and to 
              thinking, as they broke and changed, of the principal vicissitudes 
              and separations that had marked my life. I had not seen a coal fire, 
              since I had left England three years ago: though many a wood fire 
              had I watched, as it crumbled into hoary ashes, and mingled with 
              the feathery heap upon the hearth, which not inaptly figured to 
              me, in my despondency, my own dead hopes. </p>
            <p>　　I could think of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and 
              could contemplate the future in a brave spirit. Home, in its best 
              sense, was for me no more. She in whom I might have inspired a dearer 
              love, I had taught to be my sister. She would marry, and would have 
              new claimants on her tenderness; and in doing it, would never know 
              the love for her that had grown up in my heart. It was right that 
              I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion. What I reaped, 
              I had sown. </p>
            <p>　　I was thinking. And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, 
              and could I resolutely bear it, and calmly hold the place in her 
              home which she had calmly held in mine, - when I found my eyes resting 
              on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire, in its 
              association with my early remembrances. </p>
            <p>　　Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted 
              in the very first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper 
              in the shadow of an opposite corner. He was tolerably stricken in 
              years by this time; but, being a mild, meek, calm little man, had 
              worn so easily, that I thought he looked at that moment just as 
              he might have looked when he sat in our parlour, waiting for me 
              to be born. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago, and 
              I had never seen him since. He sat placidly perusing the newspaper, 
              with his little head on one side, and a glass of warm sherry negus 
              at his elbow. He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that 
              he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty 
              of reading it. </p>
            <p>　　I walked up to where he was sitting, and said, 'How do you do, 
              Mr. Chillip?' </p>
            <p>　　He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger, 
              and replied, in his slow way, 'I thank you, sir, you are very good. 
              Thank you, sir. I hope YOU are well.' </p>
            <p>　　'You don't remember me?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' returned Mr. Chillip, smiling very meekly, and shaking 
              his head as he surveyed me, 'I have a kind of an impression that 
              something in your countenance is familiar to me, sir; but I couldn't 
              lay my hand upon your name, really.' </p>
            <p>　　'And yet you knew it, long before I knew it myself,' I returned. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Did I indeed, sir?' said Mr. Chillip. 'Is it possible that I 
              had the honour, sir, of officiating when -?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' cried Mr. Chillip. 'But no doubt you are a good deal 
              changed since then, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Probably,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' observed Mr. Chillip, 'I hope you'll excuse me, 
              if I am compelled to ask the favour of your name?' </p>
            <p>　　On my telling him my name, he was really moved. He quite shook 
              hands with me - which was a violent proceeding for him, his usual 
              course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice, an inch or two 
              in advance of his hip, and evince the greatest discomposure when 
              anybody grappled with it. Even now, he put his hand in his coat-pocket 
              as soon as he could disengage it, and seemed relieved when he had 
              got it safe back. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me, sir!' said Mr. Chillip, surveying me with his head 
              on one side. 'And it's Mr. Copperfield, is it? Well, sir, I think 
              I should have known you, if I had taken the liberty of looking more 
              closely at you. There's a strong resemblance between you and your 
              poor father, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'I never had the happiness of seeing my father,' I observed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Very true, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, in a soothing tone. 'And 
              very much to be deplored it was, on all accounts! We are not ignorant, 
              sir,' said Mr. Chillip, slowly shaking his little head again, 'down 
              in our part of the country, of your fame. There must be great excitement 
              here, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, tapping himself on the forehead with 
              his forefinger. 'You must find it a trying occupation, sir!' </p>
            <p>　　'What is your part of the country now?' I asked, seating myself 
              near him. </p>
            <p>　　'I am established within a few miles of Bury St. Edmund's, sir,' 
              said Mr. Chillip. 'Mrs. Chillip, coming into a little property in 
              that neighbourhood, under her father's will, I bought a practice 
              down there, in which you will be glad to hear I am doing well. My 
              daughter is growing quite a tall lass now, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, 
              giving his little head another little shake. 'Her mother let down 
              two tucks in her frocks only last week. Such is time, you see, sir!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips, when he 
              made this reflection, I proposed to him to have it refilled, and 
              I would keep him company with another. 'Well, sir,' he returned, 
              in his slow way, 'it's more than I am accustomed to; but I can't 
              deny myself the pleasure of your conversation. It seems but yesterday 
              that I had the honour of attending you in the measles. You came 
              through them charmingly, sir!' </p>
            <p>　　I acknowledged this compliment, and ordered the negus, which 
              was soon produced. 'Quite an uncommon dissipation!' said Mr. Chillip, 
              stirring it, 'but I can't resist so extraordinary an occasion. You 
              have no family, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head. </p>
            <p>　　'I was aware that you sustained a bereavement, sir, some time 
              ago,' said Mr. Chillip. 'I heard it from your father-in-law's sister. 
              Very decided character there, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, yes,' said I, 'decided enough. Where did you see her, Mr. 
              Chillip?' </p>
            <p>　　'Are you not aware, sir,' returned Mr. Chillip, with his placidest 
              smile, 'that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'He is indeed, sir!' said Mr. Chillip. 'Married a young lady 
              of that part, with a very good little property, poor thing. - And 
              this action of the brain now, sir? Don't you find it fatigue you?' 
              said Mr. Chillip, looking at me like an admiring Robin. </p>
            <p>　　I waived that question, and returned to the Murdstones. 'I was 
              aware of his being married again. Do you attend the family?' I asked. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not regularly. I have been called in,' he replied. 'Strong phrenological 
              developments of the organ of firmness, in Mr. Murdstone and his 
              sister, sir.' I replied with such an expressive look, that Mr. Chillip 
              was emboldened by that, and the negus together, to give his head 
              several short shakes, and thoughtfully exclaim, 'Ah, dear me! We 
              remember old times, Mr. Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　'And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are 
              they?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' replied Mr. Chillip, 'a medical man, being so much 
              in families, ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but 
              his profession. Still, I must say, they are very severe, sir: both 
              as to this life and the next.' </p>
            <p>　　'The next will be regulated without much reference to them, I 
              dare say,' I returned: 'what are they doing as to this?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip shook his head, stirred his negus, and sipped it. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'She was a charming woman, sir!' he observed in a plaintive manner. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'The present Mrs. Murdstone?' </p>
            <p>　　A charming woman indeed, sir,' said Mr. Chillip; 'as amiable, 
              I am sure, as it was possible to be! Mrs. Chillip's opinion is, 
              that her spirit has been entirely broken since her marriage, and 
              that she is all but melancholy mad. And the ladies,' observed Mr. 
              Chillip, timorously, 'are great observers, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable 
              mould, Heaven help her!' said I. 'And she has been.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir, there were violent quarrels at first, I assure you,' 
              said Mr. Chillip; 'but she is quite a shadow now. Would it be considered 
              forward if I was to say to you, sir, in confidence, that since the 
              sister came to help, the brother and sister between them have nearly 
              reduced her to a state of imbecility?' </p>
            <p>　　I told him I could easily believe it. </p>
            <p>　　'I have no hesitation in saying,' said Mr. Chillip, fortifying 
              himself with another sip of negus, 'between you and me, sir, that 
              her mother died of it - or that tyranny, gloom, and worry have made 
              Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, 
              before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They 
              go about with her, now, more like her keepers than her husband and 
              sister-in-law. That was Mrs. Chillip's remark to me, only last week. 
              And I assure you, sir, the ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip 
              herself is a great observer!' </p>
            <p>　　'Does he gloomily profess to be (I am ashamed to use the word 
              in such association) religious still?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'You anticipate, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting 
              quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging. 
              'One of Mrs. Chillip's most impressive remarks. Mrs. Chillip,' he 
              proceeded, in the calmest and slowest manner, 'quite electrified 
              me, by pointing out that Mr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself, 
              and calls it the Divine Nature. You might have knocked me down on 
              the flat of my back, sir, with the feather of a pen, I assure you, 
              when Mrs. Chillip said so. The ladies are great observers, sir?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Intuitively,' said I, to his extreme delight. </p>
            <p>　　'I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir,' 
              he rejoined. 'It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical 
              opinion, I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, 
              and it is said, - in short, sir, it is said by Mrs. Chillip, - that 
              the darker tyrant he has lately been, the more ferocious is his 
              doctrine.' </p>
            <p>　　'I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say,' pursued the meekest 
              of little men, much encouraged, 'that what such people miscall their 
              religion, is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance. And do 
              you know I must say, sir,' he continued, mildly laying his head 
              on one side, 'that I DON'T find authority for Mr. and Miss Murdstone 
              in the New Testament?' </p>
            <p>　　'I never found it either!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'In the meantime, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, 'they are much disliked; 
              and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them 
              to perdition, we really have a good deal of perdition going on in 
              our neighbourhood! However, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo 
              a continual punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon 
              their own hearts, and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, 
              sir, about that brain of yours, if you'll excuse my returning to 
              it. Don't you expose it to a good deal of excitement, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　I found it not difficult, in the excitement of Mr. Chillip's 
              own brain, under his potations of negus, to divert his attention 
              from this topic to his own affairs, on which, for the next half-hour, 
              he was quite loquacious; giving me to understand, among other pieces 
              of information, that he was then at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house 
              to lay his professional evidence before a Commission of Lunacy, 
              touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged 
              from excessive drinking. 'And I assure you, sir,' he said, 'I am 
              extremely nervous on such occasions. I could not support being what 
              is called Bullied, sir. It would quite unman me. Do you know it 
              was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady, 
              on the night of your birth, Mr. Copperfield?' </p>
            <p>　　I told him that I was going down to my aunt, the Dragon of that 
              night, early in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted 
              and excellent of women, as he would know full well if he knew her 
              better. The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her 
              again, appeared to terrify him. He replied with a small pale smile, 
              'Is she so, indeed, sir? Really?' and almost immediately called 
              for a candle, and went to bed, as if he were not quite safe anywhere 
              else. He did not actually stagger under the negus; but I should 
              think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats 
              in a minute, than it had done since the great night of my aunt's 
              disappointment, when she struck at him with her bonnet. </p>
            <p>　　Thoroughly tired, I went to bed too, at midnight; passed the 
              next day on the Dover coach; burst safe and sound into my aunt's 
              old parlour while she was at tea (she wore spectacles now); and 
              was received by her, and Mr. Dick, and dear old Peggotty, who acted 
              as housekeeper, with open arms and tears of joy. My aunt was mightily 
              amused, when we began to talk composedly, by my account of my meeting 
              with Mr. Chillip, and of his holding her in such dread remembrance; 
              and both she and Peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor 
              mother's second husband, and 'that murdering woman of a sister', 
              - on whom I think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt 
              to bestow any Christian or Proper Name, or any other designation.

            <p>　　 My new life had lasted for more than a week, and I was stronger 
              than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt 
              the crisis required. I continued to walk extremely fast, and to 
              have a general idea that I was getting on. I made it a rule to take 
              as much out of myself as I possibly could, in my way of doing everything 
              to which I applied my energies. I made a perfect victim of myself. 
              I even entertained some idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet, 
              vaguely conceiving that, in becoming a graminivorous animal, I should 
              sacrifice to Dora. </p>
            <p>　　As yet, little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness, 
              otherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth. But another 
              Saturday came, and on that Saturday evening she was to be at Miss 
              Mills's; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club (telegraphed 
              to me in the street, by a bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window), 
              I was to go there to tea. </p>
            <p>　　By this time, we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street, 
              where Mr. Dick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity. 
              My aunt had obtained a signal victory over Mrs. Crupp, by paying 
              her off, throwing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out 
              of window, and protecting in person, up and down the staircase, 
              a supernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world. These vigorous 
              measures struck such terror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she 
              subsided into her own kitchen, under the impression that my aunt 
              was mad. My aunt being supremely indifferent to Mrs. Crupp's opinion 
              and everybody else's, and rather favouring than discouraging the 
              idea, Mrs. Crupp, of late the bold, became within a few days so 
              faint-hearted, that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase, 
              she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doors - leaving 
              visible, however, a wide margin of flannel petticoat - or would 
              shrink into dark corners. This gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction, 
              that I believe she took a delight in prowling up and down, with 
              her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head, at times when 
              Mrs. Crupp was likely to be in the way. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt, being uncommonly neat and ingenious, made so many little 
              improvements in our domestic arrangements, that I seemed to be richer 
              instead of poorer. Among the rest, she converted the pantry into 
              a dressing-room for me; and purchased and embellished a bedstead 
              for my occupation, which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime 
              as a bedstead could. I was the object of her constant solicitude; 
              and my poor mother herself could not have loved me better, or studied 
              more how to make me happy. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed 
              to participate in these labours; and, although she still retained 
              something of her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt, had 
              received so many marks of encouragement and confidence, that they 
              were the best friends possible. But the time had now come (I am 
              speaking of the Saturday when I was to take tea at Miss Mills's) 
              when it was necessary for her to return home, and enter on the discharge 
              of the duties she had undertaken in behalf of Ham. 'So good-bye, 
              Barkis,' said my aunt, 'and take care of yourself! I am sure I never 
              thought I could be sorry to lose you!' </p>
            <p>　　I took Peggotty to the coach office and saw her off. She cried 
              at parting, and confided her brother to my friendship as Ham had 
              done. We had heard nothing of him since he went away, that sunny 
              afternoon. </p>
            <p>　　'And now, my own dear Davy,' said Peggotty, 'if, while you're 
              a prentice, you should want any money to spend; or if, when you're 
              out of your time, my dear, you should want any to set you up (and 
              you must do one or other, or both, my darling); who has such a good 
              right to ask leave to lend it you, as my sweet girl's own old stupid 
              me!' </p>
            <p>　　I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, 
              but that if ever I borrowed money of anyone, I would borrow it of 
              her. Next to accepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave 
              Peggotty more comfort than anything I could have done. </p>
            <p>　　'And, my dear!' whispered Peggotty, 'tell the pretty little angel 
              that I should so have liked to see her, only for a minute! And tell 
              her that before she marries my boy, I'll come and make your house 
              so beautiful for you, if you'll let me!' </p>
            <p>　　I declared that nobody else should touch it; and this gave Peggotty 
              such delight that she went away in good spirits. </p>
            <p>　　I fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons 
              all day, by a variety of devices, and at the appointed time in the 
              evening repaired to Mr. Mills's street. Mr. Mills, who was a terrible 
              fellow to fall asleep after dinner, had not yet gone out, and there 
              was no bird-cage in the middle window. </p>
            <p>　　He kept me waiting so long, that I fervently hoped the Club would 
              fine him for being late. At last he came out; and then I saw my 
              own Dora hang up the bird-cage, and peep into the balcony to look 
              for me, and run in again when she saw I was there, while Jip remained 
              behind, to bark injuriously at an immense butcher's dog in the street, 
              who could have taken him like a pill. </p>
            <p>　　Dora came to the drawing-room door to meet me; and Jip came scrambling 
              out, tumbling over his own growls, under the impression that I was 
              a Bandit; and we all three went in, as happy and loving as could 
              be. I soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joys - not that 
              I meant to do it, but that I was so full of the subject - by asking 
              Dora, without the smallest preparation, if she could love a beggar? 
            </p>
            <p>　　My pretty, little, startled Dora! Her only association with the 
              word was a yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or 
              a wooden leg, or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something 
              of that kind; and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'How can you ask me anything so foolish?' pouted Dora. 'Love 
              a beggar!' </p>
            <p>　　'Dora, my own dearest!' said I. 'I am a beggar!' </p>
            <p>　　'How can you be such a silly thing,' replied Dora, slapping my 
              hand, 'as to sit there, telling such stories? I'll make Jip bite 
              you!' </p>
            <p>　　Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, 
              but it was necessary to be explicit, and I solemnly repeated: </p>
            <p>　　'Dora, my own life, I am your ruined David!' </p>
            <p>　　'I declare I'll make Jip bite you!' said Dora, shaking her curls, 
              'if you are so ridiculous.' </p>
            <p>　　But I looked so serious, that Dora left off shaking her curls, 
              and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder, and first looked 
              scared and anxious, then began to cry. That was dreadful. I fell 
              upon my knees before the sofa, caressing her, and imploring her 
              not to rend my heart; but, for some time, poor little Dora did nothing 
              but exclaim Oh dear! Oh dear! And oh, she was so frightened! And 
              where was Julia Mills! And oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away, 
              please! until I was almost beside myself. </p>
            <p>　　At last, after an agony of supplication and protestation, I got 
              Dora to look at me, with a horrified expression of face, which I 
              gradually soothed until it was only loving, and her soft, pretty 
              cheek was lying against mine. Then I told her, with my arms clasped 
              round her, how I loved her, so dearly, and so dearly; how I felt 
              it right to offer to release her from her engagement, because now 
              I was poor; how I never could bear it, or recover it, if I lost 
              her; how I had no fears of poverty, if she had none, my arm being 
              nerved and my heart inspired by her; how I was already working with 
              a courage such as none but lovers knew; how I had begun to be practical, 
              and look into the future; how a crust well earned was sweeter far 
              than a feast inherited; and much more to the same purpose, which 
              I delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising 
              to myself, though I had been thinking about it, day and night, ever 
              since my aunt had astonished me. </p>
            <p>　　'Is your heart mine still, dear Dora?' said I, rapturously, for 
              I knew by her clinging to me that it was. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, yes!' cried Dora. 'Oh, yes, it's all yours. Oh, don't be 
              dreadful!' </p>
            <p>　　I dreadful! To Dora! </p>
            <p>　　'Don't talk about being poor, and working hard!' said Dora, nestling 
              closer to me. 'Oh, don't, don't!' </p>
            <p>　　'My dearest love,' said I, 'the crust well-earned -' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, yes; but I don't want to hear any more about crusts!' said 
              Dora. 'And Jip must have a mutton-chop every day at twelve, or he'll 
              die.' </p>
            <p>　　I was charmed with her childish, winning way. I fondly explained 
              to Dora that Jip should have his mutton-chop with his accustomed 
              regularity. I drew a picture of our frugal home, made independent 
              by my labour - sketching in the little house I had seen at Highgate, 
              and my aunt in her room upstairs. </p>
            <p>　　'I am not dreadful now, Dora?' said I, tenderly. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, no, no!' cried Dora. 'But I hope your aunt will keep in 
              her own room a good deal. And I hope she's not a scolding old thing!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　If it were possible for me to love Dora more than ever, I am 
              sure I did. But I felt she was a little impracticable. It damped 
              my new-born ardour, to find that ardour so difficult of communication 
              to her. I made another trial. When she was quite herself again, 
              and was curling Jip's ears, as he lay upon her lap, I became grave, 
              and said: </p>
            <p>　　'My own! May I mention something?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, please don't be practical!' said Dora, coaxingly. 'Because 
              it frightens me so!' </p>
            <p>　　'Sweetheart!' I returned; 'there is nothing to alarm you in all 
              this. I want you to think of it quite differently. I want to make 
              it nerve you, and inspire you, Dora!' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, but that's so shocking!' cried Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'My love, no. Perseverance and strength of character will enable 
              us to bear much worse things.' 'But I haven't got any strength at 
              all,' said Dora, shaking her curls. 'Have I, Jip? Oh, do kiss Jip, 
              and be agreeable!' </p>
            <p>　　It was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held him up 
              to me for that purpose, putting her own bright, rosy little mouth 
              into kissing form, as she directed the operation, which she insisted 
              should be performed symmetrically, on the centre of his nose. I 
              did as she bade me - rewarding myself afterwards for my obedience 
              - and she charmed me out of my graver character for I don't know 
              how long. </p>
            <p>　　'But, Dora, my beloved!' said I, at last resuming it; 'I was 
              going to mention something.' </p>
            <p>　　The judge of the Prerogative Court might have fallen in love 
              with her, to see her fold her little hands and hold them up, begging 
              and praying me not to be dreadful any more. </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed I am not going to be, my darling!' I assured her. 'But, 
              Dora, my love, if you will sometimes think, - not despondingly, 
              you know; far from that! - but if you will sometimes think - just 
              to encourage yourself - that you are engaged to a poor man -' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't, don't! Pray don't!' cried Dora. 'It's so very dreadful!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My soul, not at all!' said I, cheerfully. 'If you will sometimes 
              think of that, and look about now and then at your papa's housekeeping, 
              and endeavour to acquire a little habit - of accounts, for instance 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　Poor little Dora received this suggestion with something that 
              was half a sob and half a scream. </p>
            <p>　　'- It would be so useful to us afterwards,' I went on. 'And if 
              you would promise me to read a little - a little Cookery Book that 
              I would send you, it would be so excellent for both of us. For our 
              path in life, my Dora,' said I, warming with the subject, 'is stony 
              and rugged now, and it rests with us to smooth it. We must fight 
              our way onward. We must be brave. There are obstacles to be met, 
              and we must meet, and crush them!' </p>
            <p>　　I was going on at a great rate, with a clenched hand, and a most 
              enthusiastic countenance; but it was quite unnecessary to proceed. 
              I had said enough. I had done it again. Oh, she was so frightened! 
              Oh, where was Julia Mills! Oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away, 
              please! So that, in short, I was quite distracted, and raved about 
              the drawing-room. </p>
            <p>　　I thought I had killed her, this time. I sprinkled water on her 
              face. I went down on my knees. I plucked at my hair. I denounced 
              myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast. I implored her 
              forgiveness. I besought her to look up. I ravaged Miss Mills's work-box 
              for a smelling-bottle, and in my agony of mind applied an ivory 
              needle-case instead, and dropped all the needles over Dora. I shook 
              my fists at Jip, who was as frantic as myself. I did every wild 
              extravagance that could be done, and was a long way beyond the end 
              of my wits when Miss Mills came into the room. </p>
            <p>　　'Who has done this?' exclaimed Miss Mills, succouring her friend. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I replied, 'I, Miss Mills! I have done it! Behold the destroyer!' 
              - or words to that effect - and hid my face from the light, in the 
              sofa cushion. </p>
            <p>　　At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were 
              verging on the Desert of Sahara; but she soon found out how matters 
              stood, for my dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began 
              exclaiming that I was 'a poor labourer'; and then cried for me, 
              and embraced me, and asked me would I let her give me all her money 
              to keep, and then fell on Miss Mills's neck, sobbing as if her tender 
              heart were broken. </p>
            <p>　　Miss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us. She ascertained 
              from me in a few words what it was all about, comforted Dora, and 
              gradually convinced her that I was not a labourer - from my manner 
              of stating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator, 
              and went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrow 
              - and so brought us together in peace. When we were quite composed, 
              and Dora had gone up-stairs to put some rose-water to her eyes, 
              Miss Mills rang for tea. In the ensuing interval, I told Miss Mills 
              that she was evermore my friend, and that my heart must cease to 
              vibrate ere I could forget her sympathy. </p>
            <p>　　I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured, so very 
              unsuccessfully, to expound to Dora. Miss Mills replied, on general 
              principles, that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace 
              of cold splendour, and that where love was, all was. </p>
            <p>　　I said to Miss Mills that this was very true, and who should 
              know it better than I, who loved Dora with a love that never mortal 
              had experienced yet? But on Miss Mills observing, with despondency, 
              that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so, I explained 
              that I begged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the 
              masculine gender. </p>
            <p>　　I then put it to Miss Mills, to say whether she considered that 
              there was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion I had 
              been anxious to make, concerning the accounts, the housekeeping, 
              and the Cookery Book? </p>
            <p>　　Miss Mills, after some consideration, thus replied: </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield, I will be plain with you. Mental suffering 
              and trial supply, in some natures, the place of years, and I will 
              be as plain with you as if I were a Lady Abbess. No. The suggestion 
              is not appropriate to our Dora. Our dearest Dora is a favourite 
              child of nature. She is a thing of light, and airiness, and joy. 
              I am free to confess that if it could be done, it might be well, 
              but -' And Miss Mills shook her head. </p>
            <p>　　I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss 
              Mills to ask her, whether, for Dora's sake, if she had any opportunity 
              of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life, 
              she would avail herself of it? Miss Mills replied in the affirmative 
              so readily, that I further asked her if she would take charge of 
              the Cookery Book; and, if she ever could insinuate it upon Dora's 
              acceptance, without frightening her, undertake to do me that crowning 
              service. Miss Mills accepted this trust, too; but was not sanguine. 
            </p>
            <p>　　And Dora returned, looking such a lovely little creature, that 
              I really doubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything 
              so ordinary. And she loved me so much, and was so captivating (particularly 
              when she made Jip stand on his hind legs for toast, and when she 
              pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot teapot for punishment 
              because he wouldn't), that I felt like a sort of Monster who had 
              got into a Fairy's bower, when I thought of having frightened her, 
              and made her cry. </p>
            <p>　　After tea we had the guitar; and Dora sang those same dear old 
              French songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving 
              off dancing, La ra la, La ra la, until I felt a much greater Monster 
              than before. </p>
            <p>　　We had only one check to our pleasure, and that happened a little 
              while before I took my leave, when, Miss Mills chancing to make 
              some allusion to tomorrow morning, I unluckily let out that, being 
              obliged to exert myself now, I got up at five o'clock. Whether Dora 
              had any idea that I was a Private Watchman, I am unable to say; 
              but it made a great impression on her, and she neither played nor 
              sang any more. </p>
            <p>　　It was still on her mind when I bade her adieu; and she said 
              to me, in her pretty coaxing way - as if I were a doll, I used to 
              think: </p>
            <p>　　'Now don't get up at five o'clock, you naughty boy. It's so nonsensical!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My love,' said I, 'I have work to do.' </p>
            <p>　　'But don't do it!' returned Dora. 'Why should you?' </p>
            <p>　　It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face, 
              otherwise than lightly and playfully, that we must work to live. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! How ridiculous!' cried Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'How shall we live without, Dora?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'How? Any how!' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　She seemed to think she had quite settled the question, and gave 
              me such a triumphant little kiss, direct from her innocent heart, 
              that I would hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer, 
              for a fortune. </p>
            <p>　　Well! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, 
              entirely, and completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, 
              and busily keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, 
              I would sit sometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how 
              I had frightened Dora that time, and how I could best make my way 
              with a guitar-case through the forest of difficulty, until I used 
              to fancy that my head was turning quite grey. </p>

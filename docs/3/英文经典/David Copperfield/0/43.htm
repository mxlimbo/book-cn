            <p>　　I feel as if it were not for me to record, even though this manuscript 
              is intended for no eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous 
              short-hand, and all improvement appertaining to it, in my sense 
              of responsibility to Dora and her aunts. I will only add, to what 
              I have already written of my perseverance at this time of my life, 
              and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured 
              within me, and which I know to be the strong part of my character, 
              if it have any strength at all, that there, on looking back, I find 
              the source of my success. I have been very fortunate in worldly 
              matters; many men have worked much harder, and not succeeded half 
              so well; but I never could have done what I have done, without the 
              habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination 
              to concentrate myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly 
              its successor should come upon its heels, which I then formed. Heaven 
              knows I write this, in no spirit of self-laudation. The man who 
              reviews his own life, as I do mine, in going on here, from page 
              to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he would be 
              spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many opportunities 
              wasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within 
              his breast, and defeating him. I do not hold one natural gift, I 
              dare say, that I have not abused. My meaning simply is, that whatever 
              I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do 
              well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself 
              to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been 
              thoroughly in earnest. I have never believed it possible that any 
              natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship 
              of the steady, plain, hard-working qualities, and hope to gain its 
              end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth. Some 
              happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the two sides 
              of the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that ladder 
              must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear; and there is no substitute 
              for thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to put 
              one hand to anything, on which I could throw my whole self; and 
              never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, 
              now, to have been my golden rules. </p>
            <p>　　How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept, I owe 
              to Agnes, I will not repeat here. My narrative proceeds to Agnes, 
              with a thankful love. </p>
            <p>　　She came on a visit of a fortnight to the Doctor's. Mr. Wickfield 
              was the Doctor's old friend, and the Doctor wished to talk with 
              him, and do him good. It had been matter of conversation with Agnes 
              when she was last in town, and this visit was the result. She and 
              her father came together. I was not much surprised to hear from 
              her that she had engaged to find a lodging in the neighbourhood 
              for Mrs. Heep, whose rheumatic complaint required change of air, 
              and who would be charmed to have it in such company. Neither was 
              I surprised when, on the very next day, Uriah, like a dutiful son, 
              brought his worthy mother to take possession. </p>
            <p>　　'You see, Master Copperfield,' said he, as he forced himself 
              upon my company for a turn in the Doctor's garden, 'where a person 
              loves, a person is a little jealous - leastways, anxious to keep 
              an eye on the beloved one.' </p>
            <p>　　'Of whom are you jealous, now?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Thanks to you, Master Copperfield,' he returned, 'of no one 
              in particular just at present - no male person, at least.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person?' </p>
            <p>　　He gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes, and 
              laughed. </p>
            <p>　　'Really, Master Copperfield,' he said, '- I should say Mister, 
              but I know you'll excuse the abit I've got into - you're so insinuating, 
              that you draw me like a corkscrew! Well, I don't mind telling you,' 
              putting his fish-like hand on mine, 'I'm not a lady's man in general, 
              sir, and I never was, with Mrs. Strong.' </p>
            <p>　　His eyes looked green now, as they watched mine with a rascally 
              cunning. </p>
            <p>　　'What do you mean?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, though I am a lawyer, Master Copperfield,' he replied, 
              with a dry grin, 'I mean, just at present, what I say.' </p>
            <p>　　'And what do you mean by your look?' I retorted, quietly. </p>
            <p>　　'By my look? Dear me, Copperfield, that's sharp practice! What 
              do I mean by my look?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said I. 'By your look.' </p>
            <p>　　He seemed very much amused, and laughed as heartily as it was 
              in his nature to laugh. After some scraping of his chin with his 
              hand, he went on to say, with his eyes cast downward - still scraping, 
              very slowly: </p>
            <p>　　'When I was but an umble clerk, she always looked down upon me. 
              She was for ever having my Agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse, 
              and she was for ever being a friend to you, Master Copperfield; 
              but I was too far beneath her, myself, to be noticed.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said I; 'suppose you were!' </p>
            <p>　　'- And beneath him too,' pursued Uriah, very distinctly, and 
              in a meditative tone of voice, as he continued to scrape his chin. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you know the Doctor better,' said I, 'than to suppose 
              him conscious of your existence, when you were not before him?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He directed his eyes at me in that sidelong glance again, and 
              he made his face very lantern-jawed, for the greater convenience 
              of scraping, as he answered: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear, I am not referring to the Doctor! Oh no, poor man! 
              I mean Mr. Maldon!' </p>
            <p>　　My heart quite died within me. All my old doubts and apprehensions 
              on that subject, all the Doctor's happiness and peace, all the mingled 
              possibilities of innocence and compromise, that I could not unravel, 
              I saw, in a moment, at the mercy of this fellow's twisting. </p>
            <p>　　'He never could come into the office, without ordering and shoving 
              me about,' said Uriah. 'One of your fine gentlemen he was! I was 
              very meek and umble - and I am. But I didn't like that sort of thing 
              - and I don't!' </p>
            <p>　　He left off scraping his chin, and sucked in his cheeks until 
              they seemed to meet inside; keeping his sidelong glance upon me 
              all the while. </p>
            <p>　　'She is one of your lovely women, she is,' he pursued, when he 
              had slowly restored his face to its natural form; 'and ready to 
              be no friend to such as me, I know. She's just the person as would 
              put my Agnes up to higher sort of game. Now, I ain't one of your 
              lady's men, Master Copperfield; but I've had eyes in my ed, a pretty 
              long time back. We umble ones have got eyes, mostly speaking - and 
              we look out of 'em.' </p>
            <p>　　I endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted, but, 
              I saw in his face, with poor success. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, I'm not a-going to let myself be run down, Copperfield,' 
              he continued, raising that part of his countenance, where his red 
              eyebrows would have been if he had had any, with malignant triumph, 
              'and I shall do what I can to put a stop to this friendship. I don't 
              approve of it. I don't mind acknowledging to you that I've got rather 
              a grudging disposition, and want to keep off all intruders. I ain't 
              a-going, if I know it, to run the risk of being plotted against.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You are always plotting, and delude yourself into the belief 
              that everybody else is doing the like, I think,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps so, Master Copperfield,' he replied. 'But I've got a 
              motive, as my fellow-partner used to say; and I go at it tooth and 
              nail. I mustn't be put upon, as a numble person, too much. I can't 
              allow people in my way. Really they must come out of the cart, Master 
              Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't understand you,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you, though?' he returned, with one of his jerks. 'I'm 
              astonished at that, Master Copperfield, you being usually so quick! 
              I'll try to be plainer, another time. - Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, 
              ringing at the gate, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'It looks like him,' I replied, as carelessly as I could. </p>
            <p>　　Uriah stopped short, put his hands between his great knobs of 
              knees, and doubled himself up with laughter. With perfectly silent 
              laughter. Not a sound escaped from him. I was so repelled by his 
              odious behaviour, particularly by this concluding instance, that 
              I turned away without any ceremony; and left him doubled up in the 
              middle of the garden, like a scarecrow in want of support. </p>
            <p>　　It was not on that evening; but, as I well remember, on the next 
              evening but one, which was a Sunday; that I took Agnes to see Dora. 
              I had arranged the visit, beforehand, with Miss Lavinia; and Agnes 
              was expected to tea. </p>
            <p>　　I was in a flutter of pride and anxiety; pride in my dear little 
              betrothed, and anxiety that Agnes should like her. All the way to 
              Putney, Agnes being inside the stage-coach, and I outside, I pictured 
              Dora to myself in every one of the pretty looks I knew so well; 
              now making up my mind that I should like her to look exactly as 
              she looked at such a time, and then doubting whether I should not 
              prefer her looking as she looked at such another time; and almost 
              worrying myself into a fever about it. </p>
            <p>　　I was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty, in any case; 
              but it fell out that I had never seen her look so well. She was 
              not in the drawing-room when I presented Agnes to her little aunts, 
              but was shyly keeping out of the way. I knew where to look for her, 
              now; and sure enough I found her stopping her ears again, behind 
              the same dull old door. </p>
            <p>　　At first she wouldn't come at all; and then she pleaded for five 
              minutes by my watch. When at length she put her arm through mine, 
              to be taken to the drawing-room, her charming little face was flushed, 
              and had never been so pretty. But, when we went into the room, and 
              it turned pale, she was ten thousand times prettier yet. </p>
            <p>　　Dora was afraid of Agnes. She had told me that she knew Agnes 
              was 'too clever'. But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful 
              and so earnest, and so thoughtful, and so good, she gave a faint 
              little cry of pleased surprise, and just put her affectionate arms 
              round Agnes's neck, and laid her innocent cheek against her face. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I never was so happy. I never was so pleased as when I saw those 
              two sit down together, side by side. As when I saw my little darling 
              looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes. As when I saw the 
              tender, beautiful regard which Agnes cast upon her. </p>
            <p>　　Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa partook, in their way, of my joy. 
              It was the pleasantest tea-table in the world. Miss Clarissa presided. 
              I cut and handed the sweet seed-cake - the little sisters had a 
              bird-like fondness for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar; Miss 
              Lavinia looked on with benignant patronage, as if our happy love 
              were all her work; and we were perfectly contented with ourselves 
              and one another. </p>
            <p>　　The gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts. Her 
              quiet interest in everything that interested Dora; her manner of 
              making acquaintance with Jip (who responded instantly); her pleasant 
              way, when Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me; 
              her modest grace and ease, eliciting a crowd of blushing little 
              marks of confidence from Dora; seemed to make our circle quite complete. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am so glad,' said Dora, after tea, 'that you like me. I didn't 
              think you would; and I want, more than ever, to be liked, now Julia 
              Mills is gone.' </p>
            <p>　　I have omitted to mention it, by the by. Miss Mills had sailed, 
              and Dora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend 
              to see her; and we had had preserved ginger, and guava, and other 
              delicacies of that sort for lunch; and we had left Miss Mills weeping 
              on a camp-stool on the quarter-deck, with a large new diary under 
              her arm, in which the original reflections awakened by the contemplation 
              of Ocean were to be recorded under lock and key. </p>
            <p>　　Agnes said she was afraid I must have given her an unpromising 
              character; but Dora corrected that directly. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh no!' she said, shaking her curls at me; 'it was all praise. 
              He thinks so much of your opinion, that I was quite afraid of it.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My good opinion cannot strengthen his attachment to some people 
              whom he knows,' said Agnes, with a smile; 'it is not worth their 
              having.' </p>
            <p>　　'But please let me have it,' said Dora, in her coaxing way, 'if 
              you can!' </p>
            <p>　　We made merry about Dora's wanting to be liked, and Dora said 
              I was a goose, and she didn't like me at any rate, and the short 
              evening flew away on gossamer-wings. The time was at hand when the 
              coach was to call for us. I was standing alone before the fire, 
              when Dora came stealing softly in, to give me that usual precious 
              little kiss before I went. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think, if I had had her for a friend a long time ago, 
              Doady,' said Dora, her bright eyes shining very brightly, and her 
              little right hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of 
              my coat, 'I might have been more clever perhaps?' </p>
            <p>　　'My love!' said I, 'what nonsense!' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you think it is nonsense?' returned Dora, without looking 
              at me. 'Are you sure it is?' </p>
            <p>　　'Of course I am!' 'I have forgotten,' said Dora, still turning 
              the button round and round, 'what relation Agnes is to you, you 
              dear bad boy.' </p>
            <p>　　'No blood-relation,' I replied; 'but we were brought up together, 
              like brother and sister.' </p>
            <p>　　'I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?' said Dora, beginning 
              on another button of my coat. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps because I couldn't see you, and not love you, Dora!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Suppose you had never seen me at all,' said Dora, going to another 
              button. </p>
            <p>　　'Suppose we had never been born!' said I, gaily. </p>
            <p>　　I wondered what she was thinking about, as I glanced in admiring 
              silence at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons 
              on my coat, and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast, 
              and at the lashes of her downcast eyes, slightly rising as they 
              followed her idle fingers. At length her eyes were lifted up to 
              mine, and she stood on tiptoe to give me, more thoughtfully than 
              usual, that precious little kiss - once, twice, three times - and 
              went out of the room. </p>
            <p>　　They all came back together within five minutes afterwards, and 
              Dora's unusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then. She was laughingly 
              resolved to put Jip through the whole of his performances, before 
              the coach came. They took some time (not so much on account of their 
              variety, as Jip's reluctance), and were still unfinished when it 
              was heard at the door. There was a hurried but affectionate parting 
              between Agnes and herself; and Dora was to write to Agnes (who was 
              not to mind her letters being foolish, she said), and Agnes was 
              to write to Dora; and they had a second parting at the coach door, 
              and a third when Dora, in spite of the remonstrances of Miss Lavinia, 
              would come running out once more to remind Agnes at the coach window 
              about writing, and to shake her curls at me on the box. </p>
            <p>　　The stage-coach was to put us down near Covent Garden, where 
              we were to take another stage-coach for Highgate. I was impatient 
              for the short walk in the interval, that Agnes might praise Dora 
              to me. Ah! what praise it was! How lovingly and fervently did it 
              commend the pretty creature I had won, with all her artless graces 
              best displayed, to my most gentle care! How thoughtfully remind 
              me, yet with no pretence of doing so, of the trust in which I held 
              the orphan child! </p>
            <p>　　Never, never, had I loved Dora so deeply and truly, as I loved 
              her that night. When we had again alighted, and were walking in 
              the starlight along the quiet road that led to the Doctor's house, 
              I told Agnes it was her doing. </p>
            <p>　　'When you were sitting by her,' said I, 'you seemed to be no 
              less her guardian angel than mine; and you seem so now, Agnes.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'A poor angel,' she returned, 'but faithful.' </p>
            <p>　　The clear tone of her voice, going straight to my heart, made 
              it natural to me to say: </p>
            <p>　　'The cheerfulness that belongs to you, Agnes (and to no one else 
              that ever I have seen), is so restored, I have observed today, that 
              I have begun to hope you are happier at home?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am happier in myself,' she said; 'I am quite cheerful and 
              light-hearted.' </p>
            <p>　　I glanced at the serene face looking upward, and thought it was 
              the stars that made it seem so noble. </p>
            <p>　　'There has been no change at home,' said Agnes, after a few moments. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No fresh reference,' said I, 'to - I wouldn't distress you, 
              Agnes, but I cannot help asking - to what we spoke of, when we parted 
              last?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, none,' she answered. </p>
            <p>　　'I have thought so much about it.' </p>
            <p>　　'You must think less about it. Remember that I confide in simple 
              love and truth at last. Have no apprehensions for me, Trotwood,' 
              she added, after a moment; 'the step you dread my taking, I shall 
              never take.' </p>
            <p>　　Although I think I had never really feared it, in any season 
              of cool reflection, it was an unspeakable relief to me to have this 
              assurance from her own truthful lips. I told her so, earnestly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And when this visit is over,' said I, - 'for we may not be alone 
              another time, - how long is it likely to be, my dear Agnes, before 
              you come to London again?' </p>
            <p>　　'Probably a long time,' she replied; 'I think it will be best 
              - for papa's sake - to remain at home. We are not likely to meet 
              often, for some time to come; but I shall be a good correspondent 
              of Dora's, and we shall frequently hear of one another that way.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　We were now within the little courtyard of the Doctor's cottage. 
              It was growing late. There was a light in the window of Mrs. Strong's 
              chamber, and Agnes, pointing to it, bade me good night. </p>
            <p>　　'Do not be troubled,' she said, giving me her hand, 'by our misfortunes 
              and anxieties. I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness. 
              If you can ever give me help, rely upon it I will ask you for it. 
              God bless you always!' In her beaming smile, and in these last tones 
              of her cheerful voice, I seemed again to see and hear my little 
              Dora in her company. I stood awhile, looking through the porch at 
              the stars, with a heart full of love and gratitude, and then walked 
              slowly forth. I had engaged a bed at a decent alehouse close by, 
              and was going out at the gate, when, happening to turn my head, 
              I saw a light in the Doctor's study. A half-reproachful fancy came 
              into my mind, that he had been working at the Dictionary without 
              my help. With the view of seeing if this were so, and, in any case, 
              of bidding him good night, if he were yet sitting among his books, 
              I turned back, and going softly across the hall, and gently opening 
              the door, looked in. </p>
            <p>　　The first person whom I saw, to my surprise, by the sober light 
              of the shaded lamp, was Uriah. He was standing close beside it, 
              with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth, and the other resting 
              on the Doctor's table. The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering 
              his face with his hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, 
              was leaning forward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm. </p>
            <p>　　For an instant, I supposed that the Doctor was ill. I hastily 
              advanced a step under that impression, when I met Uriah's eye, and 
              saw what was the matter. I would have withdrawn, but the Doctor 
              made a gesture to detain me, and I remained. </p>
            <p>　　'At any rate,' observed Uriah, with a writhe of his ungainly 
              person, 'we may keep the door shut. We needn't make it known to 
              ALL the town.' </p>
            <p>　　Saying which, he went on his toes to the door, which I had left 
              open, and carefully closed it. He then came back, and took up his 
              former position. There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal 
              in his voice and manner, more intolerable - at least to me - than 
              any demeanour he could have assumed. </p>
            <p>　　'I have felt it incumbent upon me, Master Copperfield,' said 
              Uriah, 'to point out to Doctor Strong what you and me have already 
              talked about. You didn't exactly understand me, though?' </p>
            <p>　　I gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good 
              old master, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort 
              and encouragement. He put his hand upon my shoulder, as it had been 
              his custom to do when I was quite a little fellow, but did not lift 
              his grey head. </p>
            <p>　　'As you didn't understand me, Master Copperfield,' resumed Uriah 
              in the same officious manner, 'I may take the liberty of umbly mentioning, 
              being among friends, that I have called Doctor Strong's attention 
              to the goings-on of Mrs. Strong. It's much against the grain with 
              me, I assure you, Copperfield, to be concerned in anything so unpleasant; 
              but really, as it is, we're all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't 
              to be. That was what my meaning was, sir, when you didn't understand 
              me.' I wonder now, when I recall his leer, that I did not collar 
              him, and try to shake the breath out of his body. </p>
            <p>　　'I dare say I didn't make myself very clear,' he went on, 'nor 
              you neither. Naturally, we was both of us inclined to give such 
              a subject a wide berth. Hows'ever, at last I have made up my mind 
              to speak plain; and I have mentioned to Doctor Strong that - did 
              you speak, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　This was to the Doctor, who had moaned. The sound might have 
              touched any heart, I thought, but it had no effect upon Uriah's. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'- mentioned to Doctor Strong,' he proceeded, 'that anyone may 
              see that Mr. Maldon, and the lovely and agreeable lady as is Doctor 
              Strong's wife, are too sweet on one another. Really the time is 
              come (we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't 
              to be), when Doctor Strong must be told that this was full as plain 
              to everybody as the sun, before Mr. Maldon went to India; that Mr. 
              Maldon made excuses to come back, for nothing else; and that he's 
              always here, for nothing else. When you come in, sir, I was just 
              putting it to my fellow-partner,' towards whom he turned, 'to say 
              to Doctor Strong upon his word and honour, whether he'd ever been 
              of this opinion long ago, or not. Come, Mr. Wickfield, sir! Would 
              you be so good as tell us? Yes or no, sir? Come, partner!' </p>
            <p>　　'For God's sake, my dear Doctor,' said Mr. Wickfield again laying 
              his irresolute hand upon the Doctor's arm, 'don't attach too much 
              weight to any suspicions I may have entertained.' </p>
            <p>　　'There!' cried Uriah, shaking his head. 'What a melancholy confirmation: 
              ain't it? Him! Such an old friend! Bless your soul, when I was nothing 
              but a clerk in his office, Copperfield, I've seen him twenty times, 
              if I've seen him once, quite in a taking about it - quite put out, 
              you know (and very proper in him as a father; I'm sure I can't blame 
              him), to think that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with what oughtn't 
              to be.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Strong,' said Mr. Wickfield in a tremulous voice, 'my 
              good friend, I needn't tell you that it has been my vice to look 
              for some one master motive in everybody, and to try all actions 
              by one narrow test. I may have fallen into such doubts as I have 
              had, through this mistake.' </p>
            <p>　　'You have had doubts, Wickfield,' said the Doctor, without lifting 
              up his head. 'You have had doubts.' </p>
            <p>　　'Speak up, fellow-partner,' urged Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　'I had, at one time, certainly,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'I - God 
              forgive me - I thought YOU had.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, no!' returned the Doctor, in a tone of most pathetic 
              grief. 'I thought, at one time,' said Mr. Wickfield, 'that you wished 
              to send Maldon abroad to effect a desirable separation.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, no!' returned the Doctor. 'To give Annie pleasure, by 
              making some provision for the companion of her childhood. Nothing 
              else.' </p>
            <p>　　'So I found,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'I couldn't doubt it, when 
              you told me so. But I thought - I implore you to remember the narrow 
              construction which has been my besetting sin - that, in a case where 
              there was so much disparity in point of years -' </p>
            <p>　　'That's the way to put it, you see, Master Copperfield!' observed 
              Uriah, with fawning and offensive pity. </p>
            <p>　　'- a lady of such youth, and such attractions, however real her 
              respect for you, might have been influenced in marrying, by worldly 
              considerations only. I make no allowance for innumerable feelings 
              and circumstances that may have all tended to good. For Heaven's 
              sake remember that!' </p>
            <p>　　'How kind he puts it!' said Uriah, shaking his head. </p>
            <p>　　'Always observing her from one point of view,' said Mr. Wickfield; 
              'but by all that is dear to you, my old friend, I entreat you to 
              consider what it was; I am forced to confess now, having no escape 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'No! There's no way out of it, Mr. Wickfield, sir,' observed 
              Uriah, 'when it's got to this.' </p>
            <p>　　'- that I did,' said Mr. Wickfield, glancing helplessly and distractedly 
              at his partner, 'that I did doubt her, and think her wanting in 
              her duty to you; and that I did sometimes, if I must say all, feel 
              averse to Agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her, as 
              to see what I saw, or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw. 
              I never mentioned this to anyone. I never meant it to be known to 
              anyone. And though it is terrible to you to hear,' said Mr. Wickfield, 
              quite subdued, 'if you knew how terrible it is for me to tell, you 
              would feel compassion for me!' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor, in the perfect goodness of his nature, put out his 
              hand. Mr. Wickfield held it for a little while in his, with his 
              head bowed down. </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure,' said Uriah, writhing himself into the silence like 
              a Conger-eel, 'that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to 
              everybody. But since we have got so far, I ought to take the liberty 
              of mentioning that Copperfield has noticed it too.' </p>
            <p>　　I turned upon him, and asked him how he dared refer to me! </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! it's very kind of you, Copperfield,' returned Uriah, undulating 
              all over, 'and we all know what an amiable character yours is; but 
              you know that the moment I spoke to you the other night, you knew 
              what I meant. You know you knew what I meant, Copperfield. Don't 
              deny it! You deny it with the best intentions; but don't do it, 
              Copperfield.' </p>
            <p>　　I saw the mild eye of the good old Doctor turned upon me for 
              a moment, and I felt that the confession of my old misgivings and 
              remembrances was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked. 
              It was of no use raging. I could not undo that. Say what I would, 
              I could not unsay it. </p>
            <p>　　We were silent again, and remained so, until the Doctor rose 
              and walked twice or thrice across the room. Presently he returned 
              to where his chair stood; and, leaning on the back of it, and occasionally 
              putting his handkerchief to his eyes, with a simple honesty that 
              did him more honour, to my thinking, than any disguise he could 
              have effected, said: </p>
            <p>　　'I have been much to blame. I believe I have been very much to 
              blame. I have exposed one whom I hold in my heart, to trials and 
              aspersions - I call them aspersions, even to have been conceived 
              in anybody's inmost mind - of which she never, but for me, could 
              have been the object.' </p>
            <p>　　Uriah Heep gave a kind of snivel. I think to express sympathy. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Of which my Annie,' said the Doctor, 'never, but for me, could 
              have been the object. Gentlemen, I am old now, as you know; I do 
              not feel, tonight, that I have much to live for. But my life - my 
              Life - upon the truth and honour of the dear lady who has been the 
              subject of this conversation!' </p>
            <p>　　I do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry, the realization 
              of the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter, 
              could have said this, with a more impressive and affecting dignity 
              than the plain old Doctor did. </p>
            <p>　　'But I am not prepared,' he went on, 'to deny - perhaps I may 
              have been, without knowing it, in some degree prepared to admit 
              - that I may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy 
              marriage. I am a man quite unaccustomed to observe; and I cannot 
              but believe that the observation of several people, of different 
              ages and positions, all too plainly tending in one direction (and 
              that so natural), is better than mine.' </p>
            <p>　　I had often admired, as I have elsewhere described, his benignant 
              manner towards his youthful wife; but the respectful tenderness 
              he manifested in every reference to her on this occasion, and the 
              almost reverential manner in which he put away from him the lightest 
              doubt of her integrity, exalted him, in my eyes, beyond description. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I married that lady,' said the Doctor, 'when she was extremely 
              young. I took her to myself when her character was scarcely formed. 
              So far as it was developed, it had been my happiness to form it. 
              I knew her father well. I knew her well. I had taught her what I 
              could, for the love of all her beautiful and virtuous qualities. 
              If I did her wrong; as I fear I did, in taking advantage (but I 
              never meant it) of her gratitude and her affection; I ask pardon 
              of that lady, in my heart!' </p>
            <p>　　He walked across the room, and came back to the same place; holding 
              the chair with a grasp that trembled, like his subdued voice, in 
              its earnestness. </p>
            <p>　　'I regarded myself as a refuge, for her, from the dangers and 
              vicissitudes of life. I persuaded myself that, unequal though we 
              were in years, she would live tranquilly and contentedly with me. 
              I did not shut out of my consideration the time when I should leave 
              her free, and still young and still beautiful, but with her judgement 
              more matured - no, gentlemen - upon my truth!' </p>
            <p>　　His homely figure seemed to be lightened up by his fidelity and 
              generosity. Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace 
              could have imparted to it. </p>
            <p>　　'My life with this lady has been very happy. Until tonight, I 
              have had uninterrupted occasion to bless the day on which I did 
              her great injustice.' </p>
            <p>　　His voice, more and more faltering in the utterance of these 
              words, stopped for a few moments; then he went on: </p>
            <p>　　'Once awakened from my dream - I have been a poor dreamer, in 
              one way or other, all my life - I see how natural it is that she 
              should have some regretful feeling towards her old companion and 
              her equal. That she does regard him with some innocent regret, with 
              some blameless thoughts of what might have been, but for me, is, 
              I fear, too true. Much that I have seen, but not noted, has come 
              back upon me with new meaning, during this last trying hour. But, 
              beyond this, gentlemen, the dear lady's name never must be coupled 
              with a word, a breath, of doubt.' </p>
            <p>　　For a little while, his eye kindled and his voice was firm; for 
              a little while he was again silent. Presently, he proceeded as before: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'It only remains for me, to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness 
              I have occasioned, as submissively as I can. It is she who should 
              reproach; not I. To save her from misconstruction, cruel misconstruction, 
              that even my friends have not been able to avoid, becomes my duty. 
              The more retired we live, the better I shall discharge it. And when 
              the time comes - may it come soon, if it be His merciful pleasure! 
              - when my death shall release her from constraint, I shall close 
              my eyes upon her honoured face, with unbounded confidence and love; 
              and leave her, with no sorrow then, to happier and brighter days.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I could not see him for the tears which his earnestness and goodness, 
              so adorned by, and so adorning, the perfect simplicity of his manner, 
              brought into my eyes. He had moved to the door, when he added: </p>
            <p>　　'Gentlemen, I have shown you my heart. I am sure you will respect 
              it. What we have said tonight is never to be said more. Wickfield, 
              give me an old friend's arm upstairs!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Wickfield hastened to him. Without interchanging a word they 
              went slowly out of the room together, Uriah looking after them. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Master Copperfield!' said Uriah, meekly turning to me. 
              'The thing hasn't took quite the turn that might have been expected, 
              for the old Scholar - what an excellent man! - is as blind as a 
              brickbat; but this family's out of the cart, I think!' </p>
            <p>　　I needed but the sound of his voice to be so madly enraged as 
              I never was before, and never have been since. </p>
            <p>　　'You villain,' said I, 'what do you mean by entrapping me into 
              your schemes? How dare you appeal to me just now, you false rascal, 
              as if we had been in discussion together?' </p>
            <p>　　As we stood, front to front, I saw so plainly, in the stealthy 
              exultation of his face, what I already so plainly knew; I mean that 
              he forced his confidence upon me, expressly to make me miserable, 
              and had set a deliberate trap for me in this very matter; that I 
              couldn't bear it. The whole of his lank cheek was invitingly before 
              me, and I struck it with my open hand with that force that my fingers 
              tingled as if I had burnt them. </p>
            <p>　　He caught the hand in his, and we stood in that connexion, looking 
              at each other. We stood so, a long time; long enough for me to see 
              the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, 
              and leave it a deeper red. </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield,' he said at length, in a breathless voice, 'have 
              you taken leave of your senses?' </p>
            <p>　　'I have taken leave of you,' said I, wresting my hand away. 'You 
              dog, I'll know no more of you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Won't you?' said he, constrained by the pain of his cheek to 
              put his hand there. 'Perhaps you won't be able to help it. Isn't 
              this ungrateful of you, now?' </p>
            <p>　　'I have shown you often enough,' said I, 'that I despise you. 
              I have shown you now, more plainly, that I do. Why should I dread 
              your doing your worst to all about you? What else do you ever do?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He perfectly understood this allusion to the considerations that 
              had hitherto restrained me in my communications with him. I rather 
              think that neither the blow, nor the allusion, would have escaped 
              me, but for the assurance I had had from Agnes that night. It is 
              no matter. </p>
            <p>　　There was another long pause. His eyes, as he looked at me, seemed 
              to take every shade of colour that could make eyes ugly. </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield,' he said, removing his hand from his cheek, 'you 
              have always gone against me. I know you always used to be against 
              me at Mr. Wickfield's.' </p>
            <p>　　'You may think what you like,' said I, still in a towering rage. 
              'If it is not true, so much the worthier you.' </p>
            <p>　　'And yet I always liked you, Copperfield!' he rejoined. </p>
            <p>　　I deigned to make him no reply; and, taking up my hat, was going 
              out to bed, when he came between me and the door. </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield,' he said, 'there must be two parties to a quarrel. 
              I won't be one.' </p>
            <p>　　'You may go to the devil!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't say that!' he replied. 'I know you'll be sorry afterwards. 
              How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad 
              spirit? But I forgive you.' </p>
            <p>　　'You forgive me!' I repeated disdainfully. </p>
            <p>　　'I do, and you can't help yourself,' replied Uriah. 'To think 
              of your going and attacking me, that have always been a friend to 
              you! But there can't be a quarrel without two parties, and I won't 
              be one. I will be a friend to you, in spite of you. So now you know 
              what you've got to expect.' </p>
            <p>　　The necessity of carrying on this dialogue (his part in which 
              was very slow; mine very quick) in a low tone, that the house might 
              not be disturbed at an unseasonable hour, did not improve my temper; 
              though my passion was cooling down. Merely telling him that I should 
              expect from him what I always had expected, and had never yet been 
              disappointed in, I opened the door upon him, as if he had been a 
              great walnut put there to be cracked, and went out of the house. 
              But he slept out of the house too, at his mother's lodging; and 
              before I had gone many hundred yards, came up with me. </p>
            <p>　　'You know, Copperfield,' he said, in my ear (I did not turn my 
              head), 'you're in quite a wrong position'; which I felt to be true, 
              and that made me chafe the more; 'you can't make this a brave thing, 
              and you can't help being forgiven. I don't intend to mention it 
              to mother, nor to any living soul. I'm determined to forgive you. 
              But I do wonder that you should lift your hand against a person 
              that you knew to be so umble!' </p>
            <p>　　I felt only less mean than he. He knew me better than I knew 
              myself. If he had retorted or openly exasperated me, it would have 
              been a relief and a justification; but he had put me on a slow fire, 
              on which I lay tormented half the night. </p>
            <p>　　In the morning, when I came out, the early church-bell was ringing, 
              and he was walking up and down with his mother. He addressed me 
              as if nothing had happened, and I could do no less than reply. I 
              had struck him hard enough to give him the toothache, I suppose. 
              At all events his face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief, 
              which, with his hat perched on the top of it, was far from improving 
              his appearance. I heard that he went to a dentist's in London on 
              the Monday morning, and had a tooth out. I hope it was a double 
              one. </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor gave out that he was not quite well; and remained 
              alone, for a considerable part of every day, during the remainder 
              of the visit. Agnes and her father had been gone a week, before 
              we resumed our usual work. On the day preceding its resumption, 
              the Doctor gave me with his own hands a folded note not sealed. 
              It was addressed to myself; and laid an injunction on me, in a few 
              affectionate words, never to refer to the subject of that evening. 
              I had confided it to my aunt, but to no one else. It was not a subject 
              I could discuss with Agnes, and Agnes certainly had not the least 
              suspicion of what had passed. </p>
            <p>　　Neither, I felt convinced, had Mrs. Strong then. Several weeks 
              elapsed before I saw the least change in her. It came on slowly, 
              like a cloud when there is no wind. At first, she seemed to wonder 
              at the gentle compassion with which the Doctor spoke to her, and 
              at his wish that she should have her mother with her, to relieve 
              the dull monotony of her life. Often, when we were at work, and 
              she was sitting by, I would see her pausing and looking at him with 
              that memorable face. Afterwards, I sometimes observed her rise, 
              with her eyes full of tears, and go out of the room. Gradually, 
              an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty, and deepened every day. 
              Mrs. Markleham was a regular inmate of the cottage then; but she 
              talked and talked, and saw nothing. </p>
            <p>　　As this change stole on Annie, once like sunshine in the Doctor's 
              house, the Doctor became older in appearance, and more grave; but 
              the sweetness of his temper, the placid kindness of his manner, 
              and his benevolent solicitude for her, if they were capable of any 
              increase, were increased. I saw him once, early on the morning of 
              her birthday, when she came to sit in the window while we were at 
              work (which she had always done, but now began to do with a timid 
              and uncertain air that I thought very touching), take her forehead 
              between his hands, kiss it, and go hurriedly away, too much moved 
              to remain. I saw her stand where he had left her, like a statue; 
              and then bend down her head, and clasp her hands, and weep, I cannot 
              say how sorrowfully. </p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, after that, I fancied that she tried to speak even 
              to me, in intervals when we were left alone. But she never uttered 
              a word. The Doctor always had some new project for her participating 
              in amusements away from home, with her mother; and Mrs. Markleham, 
              who was very fond of amusements, and very easily dissatisfied with 
              anything else, entered into them with great good-will, and was loud 
              in her commendations. But Annie, in a spiritless unhappy way, only 
              went whither she was led, and seemed to have no care for anything. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I did not know what to think. Neither did my aunt; who must have 
              walked, at various times, a hundred miles in her uncertainty. What 
              was strangest of all was, that the only real relief which seemed 
              to make its way into the secret region of this domestic unhappiness, 
              made its way there in the person of Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　What his thoughts were on the subject, or what his observation 
              was, I am as unable to explain, as I dare say he would have been 
              to assist me in the task. But, as I have recorded in the narrative 
              of my school days, his veneration for the Doctor was unbounded; 
              and there is a subtlety of perception in real attachment, even when 
              it is borne towards man by one of the lower animals, which leaves 
              the highest intellect behind. To this mind of the heart, if I may 
              call it so, in Mr. Dick, some bright ray of the truth shot straight. 
            </p>
            <p>　　He had proudly resumed his privilege, in many of his spare hours, 
              of walking up and down the garden with the Doctor; as he had been 
              accustomed to pace up and down The Doctor's Walk at Canterbury. 
              But matters were no sooner in this state, than he devoted all his 
              spare time (and got up earlier to make it more) to these perambulations. 
              If he had never been so happy as when the Doctor read that marvellous 
              performance, the Dictionary, to him; he was now quite miserable 
              unless the Doctor pulled it out of his pocket, and began. When the 
              Doctor and I were engaged, he now fell into the custom of walking 
              up and down with Mrs. Strong, and helping her to trim her favourite 
              flowers, or weed the beds. I dare say he rarely spoke a dozen words 
              in an hour: but his quiet interest, and his wistful face, found 
              immediate response in both their breasts; each knew that the other 
              liked him, and that he loved both; and he became what no one else 
              could be - a link between them. </p>
            <p>　　When I think of him, with his impenetrably wise face, walking 
              up and down with the Doctor, delighted to be battered by the hard 
              words in the Dictionary; when I think of him carrying huge watering-pots 
              after Annie; kneeling down, in very paws of gloves, at patient microscopic 
              work among the little leaves; expressing as no philosopher could 
              have expressed, in everything he did, a delicate desire to be her 
              friend; showering sympathy, trustfulness, and affection, out of 
              every hole in the watering-pot; when I think of him never wandering 
              in that better mind of his to which unhappiness addressed itself, 
              never bringing the unfortunate King Charles into the garden, never 
              wavering in his grateful service, never diverted from his knowledge 
              that there was something wrong, or from his wish to set it right- 
              I really feel almost ashamed of having known that he was not quite 
              in his wits, taking account of the utmost I have done with mine. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Nobody but myself, Trot, knows what that man is!' my aunt would 
              proudly remark, when we conversed about it. 'Dick will distinguish 
              himself yet!' </p>
            <p>　　I must refer to one other topic before I close this chapter. 
              While the visit at the Doctor's was still in progress, I observed 
              that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for 
              Uriah Heep, who remained at Highgate until the rest went back, it 
              being a leisure time; and that these were always directed in a business-like 
              manner by Mr. Micawber, who now assumed a round legal hand. I was 
              glad to infer, from these slight premises, that Mr. Micawber was 
              doing well; and consequently was much surprised to receive, about 
              this time, the following letter from his amiable wife. </p>
            <p>　　 </p>
            <p>　　 'CANTERBURY, Monday Evening. </p>
            <p>　　'You will doubtless be surprised, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to 
              receive this communication. Still more so, by its contents. Still 
              more so, by the stipulation of implicit confidence which I beg to 
              impose. But my feelings as a wife and mother require relief; and 
              as I do not wish to consult my family (already obnoxious to the 
              feelings of Mr. Micawber), I know no one of whom I can better ask 
              advice than my friend and former lodger. </p>
            <p>　　'You may be aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that between myself 
              and Mr. Micawber (whom I will never desert), there has always been 
              preserved a spirit of mutual confidence. Mr. Micawber may have occasionally 
              given a bill without consulting me, or he may have misled me as 
              to the period when that obligation would become due. This has actually 
              happened. But, in general, Mr. Micawber has had no secrets from 
              the bosom of affection - I allude to his wife - and has invariably, 
              on our retirement to rest, recalled the events of the day. </p>
            <p>　　'You will picture to yourself, my dear Mr. Copperfield, what 
              the poignancy of my feelings must be, when I inform you that Mr. 
              Micawber is entirely changed. He is reserved. He is secret. His 
              life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows - I again 
              allude to his wife - and if I should assure you that beyond knowing 
              that it is passed from morning to night at the office, I now know 
              less of it than I do of the man in the south, connected with whose 
              mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold 
              plum porridge, I should adopt a popular fallacy to express an actual 
              fact. </p>
            <p>　　'But this is not all. Mr. Micawber is morose. He is severe. He 
              is estranged from our eldest son and daughter, he has no pride in 
              his twins, he looks with an eye of coldness even on the unoffending 
              stranger who last became a member of our circle. The pecuniary means 
              of meeting our expenses, kept down to the utmost farthing, are obtained 
              from him with great difficulty, and even under fearful threats that 
              he will Settle himself (the exact expression); and he inexorably 
              refuses to give any explanation whatever of this distracting policy. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'This is hard to bear. This is heart-breaking. If you will advise 
              me, knowing my feeble powers such as they are, how you think it 
              will be best to exert them in a dilemma so unwonted, you will add 
              another friendly obligation to the many you have already rendered 
              me. With loves from the children, and a smile from the happily-unconscious 
              stranger, I remain, dear Mr. Copperfield, </p>
            <p>　　 Your afflicted, </p>
            <p>　　 'EMMA MICAWBER.' </p>
            <p>　　 I did not feel justified in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's 
              experience any other recommendation, than that she should try to 
              reclaim Mr. Micawber by patience and kindness (as I knew she would 
              in any case); but the letter set me thinking about him very much.

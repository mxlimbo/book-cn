            <p>　　 What is natural in me, is natural in many other men, I infer, 
              and so I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth 
              better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken. In the 
              keen distress of the discovery of his unworthiness, I thought more 
              of all that was brilliant in him, I softened more towards all that 
              was good in him, I did more justice to the qualities that might 
              have made him a man of a noble nature and a great name, than ever 
              I had done in the height of my devotion to him. Deeply as I felt 
              my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home, I believed 
              that if I had been brought face to face with him, I could not have 
              uttered one reproach. I should have loved him so well still - though 
              he fascinated me no longer - I should have held in so much tenderness 
              the memory of my affection for him, that I think I should have been 
              as weak as a spirit-wounded child, in all but the entertainment 
              of a thought that we could ever be re-united. That thought I never 
              had. I felt, as he had felt, that all was at an end between us. 
              What his remembrances of me were, I have never known - they were 
              light enough, perhaps, and easily dismissed - but mine of him were 
              as the remembrances of a cherished friend, who was dead. </p>
            <p>　　Yes, Steerforth, long removed from the scenes of this poor history! 
              My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement 
              Throne; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will, I know! 
            </p>
            <p>　　The news of what had happened soon spread through the town; insomuch 
              that as I passed along the streets next morning, I overheard the 
              people speaking of it at their doors. Many were hard upon her, some 
              few were hard upon him, but towards her second father and her lover 
              there was but one sentiment. Among all kinds of people a respect 
              for them in their distress prevailed, which was full of gentleness 
              and delicacy. The seafaring men kept apart, when those two were 
              seen early, walking with slow steps on the beach; and stood in knots, 
              talking compassionately among themselves. </p>
            <p>　　It was on the beach, close down by the sea, that I found them. 
              It would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all 
              last night, even if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still 
              sitting just as I left them, when it was broad day. They looked 
              worn; and I thought Mr. Peggotty's head was bowed in one night more 
              than in all the years I had known him. But they were both as grave 
              and steady as the sea itself, then lying beneath a dark sky, waveless 
              - yet with a heavy roll upon it, as if it breathed in its rest - 
              and touched, on the horizon, with a strip of silvery light from 
              the unseen sun. </p>
            <p>　　'We have had a mort of talk, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty to me, when 
              we had all three walked a little while in silence, 'of what we ought 
              and doen't ought to do. But we see our course now.' </p>
            <p>　　I happened to glance at Ham, then looking out to sea upon the 
              distant light, and a frightful thought came into my mind - not that 
              his face was angry, for it was not; I recall nothing but an expression 
              of stern determination in it - that if ever he encountered Steerforth, 
              he would kill him. </p>
            <p>　　'My dooty here, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'is done. I'm a going 
              to seek my -' he stopped, and went on in a firmer voice: 'I'm a 
              going to seek her. That's my dooty evermore.' </p>
            <p>　　He shook his head when I asked him where he would seek her, and 
              inquired if I were going to London tomorrow? I told him I had not 
              gone today, fearing to lose the chance of being of any service to 
              him; but that I was ready to go when he would. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll go along with you, sir,' he rejoined, 'if you're agreeable, 
              tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　We walked again, for a while, in silence. </p>
            <p>　　'Ham,'he presently resumed,'he'll hold to his present work, and 
              go and live along with my sister. The old boat yonder -' </p>
            <p>　　'Will you desert the old boat, Mr. Peggotty?' I gently interposed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My station, Mas'r Davy,' he returned, 'ain't there no longer; 
              and if ever a boat foundered, since there was darkness on the face 
              of the deep, that one's gone down. But no, sir, no; I doen't mean 
              as it should be deserted. Fur from that.' </p>
            <p>　　We walked again for a while, as before, until he explained: </p>
            <p>　　'My wishes is, sir, as it shall look, day and night, winter and 
              summer, as it has always looked, since she fust know'd it. If ever 
              she should come a wandering back, I wouldn't have the old place 
              seem to cast her off, you understand, but seem to tempt her to draw 
              nigher to 't, and to peep in, maybe, like a ghost, out of the wind 
              and rain, through the old winder, at the old seat by the fire. Then, 
              maybe, Mas'r Davy, seein' none but Missis Gummidge there, she might 
              take heart to creep in, trembling; and might come to be laid down 
              in her old bed, and rest her weary head where it was once so gay.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I could not speak to him in reply, though I tried. </p>
            <p>　　'Every night,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'as reg'lar as the night comes, 
              the candle must be stood in its old pane of glass, that if ever 
              she should see it, it may seem to say &quot;Come back, my child, 
              come back!&quot; If ever there's a knock, Ham (partic'ler a soft 
              knock), arter dark, at your aunt's door, doen't you go nigh it. 
              Let it be her - not you - that sees my fallen child!' </p>
            <p>　　He walked a little in front of us, and kept before us for some 
              minutes. During this interval, I glanced at Ham again, and observing 
              the same expression on his face, and his eyes still directed to 
              the distant light, I touched his arm. </p>
            <p>　　Twice I called him by his name, in the tone in which I might 
              have tried to rouse a sleeper, before he heeded me. When I at last 
              inquired on what his thoughts were so bent, he replied: </p>
            <p>　　'On what's afore me, Mas'r Davy; and over yon.' 'On the life 
              before you, do you mean?' He had pointed confusedly out to sea. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Ay, Mas'r Davy. I doen't rightly know how 'tis, but from over 
              yon there seemed to me to come - the end of it like,' looking at 
              me as if he were waking, but with the same determined face. </p>
            <p>　　'What end?' I asked, possessed by my former fear. </p>
            <p>　　'I doen't know,'he said, thoughtfully; 'I was calling to mind 
              that the beginning of it all did take place here - and then the 
              end come. But it's gone! Mas'r Davy,' he added; answering, as I 
              think, my look; 'you han't no call to be afeerd of me: but I'm kiender 
              muddled; I don't fare to feel no matters,' - which was as much as 
              to say that he was not himself, and quite confounded. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty stopping for us to join him: we did so, and said 
              no more. The remembrance of this, in connexion with my former thought, 
              however, haunted me at intervals, even until the inexorable end 
              came at its appointed time. </p>
            <p>　　We insensibly approached the old boat, and entered. Mrs. Gummidge, 
              no longer moping in her especial corner, was busy preparing breakfast. 
              She took Mr. Peggotty's hat, and placed his seat for him, and spoke 
              so comfortably and softly, that I hardly knew her. </p>
            <p>　　'Dan'l, my good man,' said she, 'you must eat and drink, and 
              keep up your strength, for without it you'll do nowt. Try, that's 
              a dear soul! An if I disturb you with my clicketten,' she meant 
              her chattering, 'tell me so, Dan'l, and I won't.' </p>
            <p>　　When she had served us all, she withdrew to the window, where 
              she sedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other 
              clothes belonging to Mr. Peggotty, and neatly folding and packing 
              them in an old oilskin bag, such as sailors carry. Meanwhile, she 
              continued talking, in the same quiet manner: </p>
            <p>　　'All times and seasons, you know, Dan'l,' said Mrs. Gummidge, 
              'I shall be allus here, and everythink will look accordin' to your 
              wishes. I'm a poor scholar, but I shall write to you, odd times, 
              when you're away, and send my letters to Mas'r Davy. Maybe you'll 
              write to me too, Dan'l, odd times, and tell me how you fare to feel 
              upon your lone lorn journies.' </p>
            <p>　　'You'll be a solitary woman heer, I'm afeerd!' said Mr. Peggotty. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, Dan'l,' she returned, 'I shan't be that. Doen't you 
              mind me. I shall have enough to do to keep a Beein for you' (Mrs. 
              Gummidge meant a home), 'again you come back - to keep a Beein here 
              for any that may hap to come back, Dan'l. In the fine time, I shall 
              set outside the door as I used to do. If any should come nigh, they 
              shall see the old widder woman true to 'em, a long way off.' </p>
            <p>　　What a change in Mrs. Gummidge in a little time! She was another 
              woman. She was so devoted, she had such a quick perception of what 
              it would be well to say, and what it would be well to leave unsaid; 
              she was so forgetful of herself, and so regardful of the sorrow 
              about her, that I held her in a sort of veneration. The work she 
              did that day! There were many things to be brought up from the beach 
              and stored in the outhouse - as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, 
              lobster-pots, bags of ballast, and the like; and though there was 
              abundance of assistance rendered, there being not a pair of working 
              hands on all that shore but would have laboured hard for Mr. Peggotty, 
              and been well paid in being asked to do it, yet she persisted, all 
              day long, in toiling under weights that she was quite unequal to, 
              and fagging to and fro on all sorts of unnecessary errands. As to 
              deploring her misfortunes, she appeared to have entirely lost the 
              recollection of ever having had any. She preserved an equable cheerfulness 
              in the midst of her sympathy, which was not the least astonishing 
              part of the change that had come over her. Querulousness was out 
              of the question. I did not even observe her voice to falter, or 
              a tear to escape from her eyes, the whole day through, until twilight; 
              when she and I and Mr. Peggotty being alone together, and he having 
              fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she broke into a half-suppressed 
              fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to the door, said, 'Ever 
              bless you, Mas'r Davy, be a friend to him, poor dear!' Then, she 
              immediately ran out of the house to wash her face, in order that 
              she might sit quietly beside him, and be found at work there, when 
              he should awake. In short I left her, when I went away at night, 
              the prop and staff of Mr. Peggotty's affliction; and I could not 
              meditate enough upon the lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge, and 
              the new experience she unfolded to me. </p>
            <p>　　It was between nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy 
              manner through the town, I stopped at Mr. Omer's door. Mr. Omer 
              had taken it so much to heart, his daughter told me, that he had 
              been very low and poorly all day, and had gone to bed without his 
              pipe. </p>
            <p>　　'A deceitful, bad-hearted girl,' said Mrs. Joram. 'There was 
              no good in her, ever!' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't say so,' I returned. 'You don't think so.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I do!' cried Mrs. Joram, angrily. </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Joram tossed her head, endeavouring to be very stern and 
              cross; but she could not command her softer self, and began to cry. 
              I was young, to be sure; but I thought much the better of her for 
              this sympathy, and fancied it became her, as a virtuous wife and 
              mother, very well indeed. </p>
            <p>　　'What will she ever do!' sobbed Minnie. 'Where will she go! What 
              will become of her! Oh, how could she be so cruel, to herself and 
              him!' </p>
            <p>　　I remembered the time when Minnie was a young and pretty girl; 
              and I was glad she remembered it too, so feelingly. </p>
            <p>　　'My little Minnie,' said Mrs. Joram, 'has only just now been 
              got to sleep. Even in her sleep she is sobbing for Em'ly. All day 
              long, little Minnie has cried for her, and asked me, over and over 
              again, whether Em'ly was wicked? What can I say to her, when Em'ly 
              tied a ribbon off her own neck round little Minnie's the last night 
              she was here, and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till 
              she was fast asleep! The ribbon's round my little Minnie's neck 
              now. It ought not to be, perhaps, but what can I do? Em'ly is very 
              bad, but they were fond of one another. And the child knows nothing!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Joram was so unhappy that her husband came out to take care 
              of her. Leaving them together, I went home to Peggotty's; more melancholy 
              myself, if possible, than I had been yet. </p>
            <p>　　That good creature - I mean Peggotty - all untired by her late 
              anxieties and sleepless nights, was at her brother's, where she 
              meant to stay till morning. An old woman, who had been employed 
              about the house for some weeks past, while Peggotty had been unable 
              to attend to it, was the house's only other occupant besides myself. 
              As I had no occasion for her services, I sent her to bed, by no 
              means against her will, and sat down before the kitchen fire a little 
              while, to think about all this. </p>
            <p>　　I was blending it with the deathbed of the late Mr. Barkis, and 
              was driving out with the tide towards the distance at which Ham 
              had looked so singularly in the morning, when I was recalled from 
              my wanderings by a knock at the door. There was a knocker upon the 
              door, but it was not that which made the sound. The tap was from 
              a hand, and low down upon the door, as if it were given by a child. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman 
              to a person of distinction. I opened the door; and at first looked 
              down, to my amazement, on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared 
              to be walking about of itself. But presently I discovered underneath 
              it, Miss Mowcher. </p>
            <p>　　I might not have been prepared to give the little creature a 
              very kind reception, if, on her removing the umbrella, which her 
              utmost efforts were unable to shut up, she had shown me the 'volatile' 
              expression of face which had made so great an impression on me at 
              our first and last meeting. But her face, as she turned it up to 
              mine, was so earnest; and when I relieved her of the umbrella (which 
              would have been an inconvenient one for the Irish Giant), she wrung 
              her little hands in such an afflicted manner; that I rather inclined 
              towards her. </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Mowcher!' said I, after glancing up and down the empty 
              street, without distinctly knowing what I expected to see besides; 
              'how do you come here? What is the matter?' She motioned to me with 
              her short right arm, to shut the umbrella for her; and passing me 
              hurriedly, went into the kitchen. When I had closed the door, and 
              followed, with the umbrella in my hand, I found her sitting on the 
              corner of the fender - it was a low iron one, with two flat bars 
              at top to stand plates upon - in the shadow of the boiler, swaying 
              herself backwards and forwards, and chafing her hands upon her knees 
              like a person in pain. </p>
            <p>　　Quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit, 
              and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour, I exclaimed 
              again, 'Pray tell me, Miss Mowcher, what is the matter! are you 
              ill?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear young soul,' returned Miss Mowcher, squeezing her hands 
              upon her heart one over the other. 'I am ill here, I am very ill. 
              To think that it should come to this, when I might have known it 
              and perhaps prevented it, if I hadn't been a thoughtless fool!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Again her large bonnet (very disproportionate to the figure) 
              went backwards and forwards, in her swaying of her little body to 
              and fro; while a most gigantic bonnet rocked, in unison with it, 
              upon the wall. </p>
            <p>　　'I am surprised,' I began, 'to see you so distressed and serious'- 
              when she interrupted me. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, it's always so!' she said. 'They are all surprised, these 
              inconsiderate young people, fairly and full grown, to see any natural 
              feeling in a little thing like me! They make a plaything of me, 
              use me for their amusement, throw me away when they are tired, and 
              wonder that I feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier! Yes, 
              yes, that's the way. The old way!' </p>
            <p>　　'It may be, with others,' I returned, 'but I do assure you it 
              is not with me. Perhaps I ought not to be at all surprised to see 
              you as you are now: I know so little of you. I said, without consideration, 
              what I thought.' </p>
            <p>　　'What can I do?' returned the little woman, standing up, and 
              holding out her arms to show herself. 'See! What I am, my father 
              was; and my sister is; and my brother is. I have worked for sister 
              and brother these many years - hard, Mr. Copperfield - all day. 
              I must live. I do no harm. If there are people so unreflecting or 
              so cruel, as to make a jest of me, what is left for me to do but 
              to make a jest of myself, them, and everything? If I do so, for 
              the time, whose fault is that? Mine?' </p>
            <p>　　No. Not Miss Mowcher's, I perceived. </p>
            <p>　　'If I had shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend,' 
              pursued the little woman, shaking her head at me, with reproachful 
              earnestness, 'how much of his help or good will do you think I should 
              ever have had? If little Mowcher (who had no hand, young gentleman, 
              in the making of herself) addressed herself to him, or the like 
              of him, because of her misfortunes, when do you suppose her small 
              voice would have been heard? Little Mowcher would have as much need 
              to live, if she was the bitterest and dullest of pigmies; but she 
              couldn't do it. No. She might whistle for her bread and butter till 
              she died of Air.' </p>
            <p>　　Miss Mowcher sat down on the fender again, and took out her handkerchief, 
              and wiped her eyes. </p>
            <p>　　'Be thankful for me, if you have a kind heart, as I think you 
              have,' she said, 'that while I know well what I am, I can be cheerful 
              and endure it all. I am thankful for myself, at any rate, that I 
              can find my tiny way through the world, without being beholden to 
              anyone; and that in return for all that is thrown at me, in folly 
              or vanity, as I go along, I can throw bubbles back. If I don't brood 
              over all I want, it is the better for me, and not the worse for 
              anyone. If I am a plaything for you giants, be gentle with me.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Miss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket, looking 
              at me with very intent expression all the while, and pursued: </p>
            <p>　　'I saw you in the street just now. You may suppose I am not able 
              to walk as fast as you, with my short legs and short breath, and 
              I couldn't overtake you; but I guessed where you came, and came 
              after you. I have been here before, today, but the good woman wasn't 
              at home.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you know her?' I demanded. </p>
            <p>　　'I know of her, and about her,' she replied, 'from Omer and Joram. 
              I was there at seven o'clock this morning. Do you remember what 
              Steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl, that time when 
              I saw you both at the inn?' </p>
            <p>　　The great bonnet on Miss Mowcher's head, and the greater bonnet 
              on the wall, began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked 
              this question. </p>
            <p>　　I remembered very well what she referred to, having had it in 
              my thoughts many times that day. I told her so. </p>
            <p>　　'May the Father of all Evil confound him,' said the little woman, 
              holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes, 'and 
              ten times more confound that wicked servant; but I believed it was 
              YOU who had a boyish passion for her!' </p>
            <p>　　'I?' I repeated. </p>
            <p>　　'Child, child! In the name of blind ill-fortune,' cried Miss 
              Mowcher, wringing her hands impatiently, as she went to and fro 
              again upon the fender, 'why did you praise her so, and blush, and 
              look disturbed? ' </p>
            <p>　　I could not conceal from myself that I had done this, though 
              for a reason very different from her supposition. </p>
            <p>　　'What did I know?' said Miss Mowcher, taking out her handkerchief 
              again, and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever, at short 
              intervals, she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once. 'He 
              was crossing you and wheedling you, I saw; and you were soft wax 
              in his hands, I saw. Had I left the room a minute, when his man 
              told me that &quot;Young Innocence&quot; (so he called you, and 
              you may call him &quot;Old Guilt&quot; all the days of your life) 
              had set his heart upon her, and she was giddy and liked him, but 
              his master was resolved that no harm should come of it - more for 
              your sake than for hers - and that that was their business here? 
              How could I BUT believe him? I saw Steerforth soothe and please 
              you by his praise of her! You were the first to mention her name. 
              You owned to an old admiration of her. You were hot and cold, and 
              red and white, all at once when I spoke to you of her. What could 
              I think - what DID I think - but that you were a young libertine 
              in everything but experience, and had fallen into hands that had 
              experience enough, and could manage you (having the fancy) for your 
              own good? Oh! oh! oh! They were afraid of my finding out the truth,' 
              exclaimed Miss Mowcher, getting off the fender, and trotting up 
              and down the kitchen with her two short arms distressfully lifted 
              up, 'because I am a sharp little thing - I need be, to get through 
              the world at all! - and they deceived me altogether, and I gave 
              the poor unfortunate girl a letter, which I fully believe was the 
              beginning of her ever speaking to Littimer, who was left behind 
              on purpose!' </p>
            <p>　　I stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy, looking 
              at Miss Mowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she 
              was out of breath: when she sat upon the fender again, and, drying 
              her face with her handkerchief, shook her head for a long time, 
              without otherwise moving, and without breaking silence. </p>
            <p>　　'My country rounds,' she added at length, 'brought me to Norwich, 
              Mr. Copperfield, the night before last. What I happened to find 
              there, about their secret way of coming and going, without you - 
              which was strange - led to my suspecting something wrong. I got 
              into the coach from London last night, as it came through Norwich, 
              and was here this morning. Oh, oh, oh! too late!' </p>
            <p>　　Poor little Mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and 
              fretting, that she turned round on the fender, putting her poor 
              little wet feet in among the ashes to warm them, and sat looking 
              at the fire, like a large doll. I sat in a chair on the other side 
              of the hearth, lost in unhappy reflections, and looking at the fire 
              too, and sometimes at her. </p>
            <p>　　'I must go,' she said at last, rising as she spoke. 'It's late. 
              You don't mistrust me?' </p>
            <p>　　Meeting her sharp glance, which was as sharp as ever when she 
              asked me, I could not on that short challenge answer no, quite frankly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Come!' said she, accepting the offer of my hand to help her 
              over the fender, and looking wistfully up into my face, 'you know 
              you wouldn't mistrust me, if I was a full-sized woman!' </p>
            <p>　　I felt that there was much truth in this; and I felt rather ashamed 
              of myself. </p>
            <p>　　'You are a young man,' she said, nodding. 'Take a word of advice, 
              even from three foot nothing. Try not to associate bodily defects 
              with mental, my good friend, except for a solid reason.' </p>
            <p>　　She had got over the fender now, and I had got over my suspicion. 
              I told her that I believed she had given me a faithful account of 
              herself, and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing 
              hands. She thanked me, and said I was a good fellow. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, mind!' she exclaimed, turning back on her way to the door, 
              and looking shrewdly at me, with her forefinger up again.- 'I have 
              some reason to suspect, from what I have heard - my ears are always 
              open; I can't afford to spare what powers I have - that they are 
              gone abroad. But if ever they return, if ever any one of them returns, 
              while I am alive, I am more likely than another, going about as 
              I do, to find it out soon. Whatever I know, you shall know. If ever 
              I can do anything to serve the poor betrayed girl, I will do it 
              faithfully, please Heaven! And Littimer had better have a bloodhound 
              at his back, than little Mowcher!' </p>
            <p>　　I placed implicit faith in this last statement, when I marked 
              the look with which it was accompanied. </p>
            <p>　　'Trust me no more, but trust me no less, than you would trust 
              a full-sized woman,' said the little creature, touching me appealingly 
              on the wrist. 'If ever you see me again, unlike what I am now, and 
              like what I was when you first saw me, observe what company I am 
              in. Call to mind that I am a very helpless and defenceless little 
              thing. Think of me at home with my brother like myself and sister 
              like myself, when my day's work is done. Perhaps you won't, then, 
              be very hard upon me, or surprised if I can be distressed and serious. 
              Good night!' </p>
            <p>　　I gave Miss Mowcher my hand, with a very different opinion of 
              her from that which I had hitherto entertained, and opened the door 
              to let her out. It was not a trifling business to get the great 
              umbrella up, and properly balanced in her grasp; but at last I successfully 
              accomplished this, and saw it go bobbing down the street through 
              the rain, without the least appearance of having anybody underneath 
              it, except when a heavier fall than usual from some over-charged 
              water-spout sent it toppling over, on one side, and discovered Miss 
              Mowcher struggling violently to get it right. After making one or 
              two sallies to her relief, which were rendered futile by the umbrella's 
              hopping on again, like an immense bird, before I could reach it, 
              I came in, went to bed, and slept till morning. </p>
            <p>　　In the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse, 
              and we went at an early hour to the coach office, where Mrs. Gummidge 
              and Ham were waiting to take leave of us. </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy,' Ham whispered, drawing me aside, while Mr. Peggotty 
              was stowing his bag among the luggage, 'his life is quite broke 
              up. He doen't know wheer he's going; he doen't know -what's afore 
              him; he's bound upon a voyage that'll last, on and off, all the 
              rest of his days, take my wured for 't, unless he finds what he's 
              a seeking of. I am sure you'll be a friend to him, Mas'r Davy?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Trust me, I will indeed,' said I, shaking hands with Ham earnestly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Thankee. Thankee, very kind, sir. One thing furder. I'm in good 
              employ, you know, Mas'r Davy, and I han't no way now of spending 
              what I gets. Money's of no use to me no more, except to live. If 
              you can lay it out for him, I shall do my work with a better art. 
              Though as to that, sir,' and he spoke very steadily and mildly, 
              'you're not to think but I shall work at all times, like a man, 
              and act the best that lays in my power!' </p>
            <p>　　I told him I was well convinced of it; and I hinted that I hoped 
              the time might even come, when he would cease to lead the lonely 
              life he naturally contemplated now. </p>
            <p>　　'No, sir,' he said, shaking his head, 'all that's past and over 
              with me, sir. No one can never fill the place that's empty. But 
              you'll bear in mind about the money, as theer's at all times some 
              laying by for him?' </p>
            <p>　　Reminding him of the fact, that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady, 
              though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his 
              late brother-in-law, I promised to do so. We then took leave of 
              each other. I cannot leave him even now, without remembering with 
              a pang, at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow. </p>
            <p>　　As to Mrs. Gummidge, if I were to endeavour to describe how she 
              ran down the street by the side of the coach, seeing nothing but 
              Mr. Peggotty on the roof, through the tears she tried to repress, 
              and dashing herself against the people who were coming in the opposite 
              direction, I should enter on a task of some difficulty. Therefore 
              I had better leave her sitting on a baker's door-step, out of breath, 
              with no shape at all remaining in her bonnet, and one of her shoes 
              off, lying on the pavement at a considerable distance. </p>
            <p>　　When we got to our journey's end, our first pursuit was to look 
              about for a little lodging for Peggotty, where her brother could 
              have a bed. We were so fortunate as to find one, of a very clean 
              and cheap description, over a chandler's shop, only two streets 
              removed from me. When we had engaged this domicile, I bought some 
              cold meat at an eating-house, and took my fellow-travellers home 
              to tea; a proceeding, I regret to state, which did not meet with 
              Mrs. Crupp's approval, but quite the contrary. I ought to observe, 
              however, in explanation of that lady's state of mind, that she was 
              much offended by Peggotty's tucking up her widow's gown before she 
              had been ten minutes in the place, and setting to work to dust my 
              bedroom. This Mrs. Crupp regarded in the light of a liberty, and 
              a liberty, she said, was a thing she never allowed. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London 
              for which I was not unprepared. It was, that he purposed first seeing 
              Mrs. Steerforth. As I felt bound to assist him in this, and also 
              to mediate between them; with the view of sparing the mother's feelings 
              as much as possible, I wrote to her that night. I told her as mildly 
              as I could what his wrong was, and what my own share in his injury. 
              I said he was a man in very common life, but of a most gentle and 
              upright character; and that I ventured to express a hope that she 
              would not refuse to see him in his heavy trouble. I mentioned two 
              o'clock in the afternoon as the hour of our coming, and I sent the 
              letter myself by the first coach in the morning. </p>
            <p>　　At the appointed time, we stood at the door - the door of that 
              house where I had been, a few days since, so happy: where my youthful 
              confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely: which 
              was closed against me henceforth: which was now a waste, a ruin. 
            </p>
            <p>　　No Littimer appeared. The pleasanter face which had replaced 
              his, on the occasion of my last visit, answered to our summons, 
              and went before us to the drawing-room. Mrs. Steerforth was sitting 
              there. Rosa Dartle glided, as we went in, from another part of the 
              room and stood behind her chair. </p>
            <p>　　I saw, directly, in his mother's face, that she knew from himself 
              what he had done. It was very pale; and bore the traces of deeper 
              emotion than my letter alone, weakened by the doubts her fondness 
              would have raised upon it, would have been likely to create. I thought 
              her more like him than ever I had thought her; and I felt, rather 
              than saw, that the resemblance was not lost on my companion. </p>
            <p>　　She sat upright in her arm-chair, with a stately, immovable, 
              passionless air, that it seemed as if nothing could disturb. She 
              looked very steadfastly at Mr. Peggotty when he stood before her; 
              and he looked quite as steadfastly at her. Rosa Dartle's keen glance 
              comprehended all of us. For some moments not a word was spoken. 
            </p>
            <p>　　She motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated. He said, in a low 
              voice, 'I shouldn't feel it nat'ral, ma'am, to sit down in this 
              house. I'd sooner stand.' And this was succeeded by another silence, 
              which she broke thus: </p>
            <p>　　'I know, with deep regret, what has brought you here. What do 
              you want of me? What do you ask me to do?' </p>
            <p>　　He put his hat under his arm, and feeling in his breast for Emily's 
              letter, took it out, unfolded it, and gave it to her. 'Please to 
              read that, ma'am. That's my niece's hand!' </p>
            <p>　　She read it, in the same stately and impassive way, - untouched 
              by its contents, as far as I could see, - and returned it to him. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Unless he brings me back a lady,&quot;' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              tracing out that part with his finger. 'I come to know, ma'am, whether 
              he will keep his wured?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' she returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Why not?' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'It is impossible. He would disgrace himself. You cannot fail 
              to know that she is far below him.' </p>
            <p>　　'Raise her up!' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'She is uneducated and ignorant.' </p>
            <p>　　'Maybe she's not; maybe she is,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'I think 
              not, ma'am; but I'm no judge of them things. Teach her better!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Since you oblige me to speak more plainly, which I am very unwilling 
              to do, her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible, 
              if nothing else did.' </p>
            <p>　　'Hark to this, ma'am,' he returned, slowly and quietly. 'You 
              know what it is to love your child. So do I. If she was a hundred 
              times my child, I couldn't love her more. You doen't know what it 
              is to lose your child. I do. All the heaps of riches in the wureld 
              would be nowt to me (if they was mine) to buy her back! But, save 
              her from this disgrace, and she shall never be disgraced by us. 
              Not one of us that she's growed up among, not one of us that's lived 
              along with her and had her for their all in all, these many year, 
              will ever look upon her pritty face again. We'll be content to let 
              her be; we'll be content to think of her, far off, as if she was 
              underneath another sun and sky; we'll be content to trust her to 
              her husband, - to her little children, p'raps, - and bide the time 
              when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God!' </p>
            <p>　　The rugged eloquence with which he spoke, was not devoid of all 
              effect. She still preserved her proud manner, but there was a touch 
              of softness in her voice, as she answered: </p>
            <p>　　'I justify nothing. I make no counter-accusations. But I am sorry 
              to repeat, it is impossible. Such a marriage would irretrievably 
              blight my son's career, and ruin his prospects. Nothing is more 
              certain than that it never can take place, and never will. If there 
              is any other compensation -' </p>
            <p>　　'I am looking at the likeness of the face,' interrupted Mr. Peggotty, 
              with a steady but a kindling eye, 'that has looked at me, in my 
              home, at my fireside, in my boat - wheer not? - smiling and friendly, 
              when it was so treacherous, that I go half wild when I think of 
              it. If the likeness of that face don't turn to burning fire, at 
              the thought of offering money to me for my child's blight and ruin, 
              it's as bad. I doen't know, being a lady's, but what it's worse.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　She changed now, in a moment. An angry flush overspread her features; 
              and she said, in an intolerant manner, grasping the arm-chair tightly 
              with her hands: </p>
            <p>　　'What compensation can you make to ME for opening such a pit 
              between me and my son? What is your love to mine? What is your separation 
              to ours?' </p>
            <p>　　Miss Dartle softly touched her, and bent down her head to whisper, 
              but she would not hear a word. </p>
            <p>　　'No, Rosa, not a word! Let the man listen to what I say! My son, 
              who has been the object of my life, to whom its every thought has 
              been devoted, whom I have gratified from a child in every wish, 
              from whom I have had no separate existence since his birth, - to 
              take up in a moment with a miserable girl, and avoid me! To repay 
              my confidence with systematic deception, for her sake, and quit 
              me for her! To set this wretched fancy, against his mother's claims 
              upon his duty, love, respect, gratitude - claims that every day 
              and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing 
              could be proof against! Is this no injury?' </p>
            <p>　　Again Rosa Dartle tried to soothe her; again ineffectually. </p>
            <p>　　'I say, Rosa, not a word! If he can stake his all upon the lightest 
              object, I can stake my all upon a greater purpose. Let him go where 
              he will, with the means that my love has secured to him! Does he 
              think to reduce me by long absence? He knows his mother very little 
              if he does. Let him put away his whim now, and he is welcome back. 
              Let him not put her away now, and he never shall come near me, living 
              or dying, while I can raise my hand to make a sign against it, unless, 
              being rid of her for ever, he comes humbly to me and begs for my 
              forgiveness. This is my right. This is the acknowledgement I WILL 
              HAVE. This is the separation that there is between us! And is this,' 
              she added, looking at her visitor with the proud intolerant air 
              with which she had begun, 'no injury?' </p>
            <p>　　While I heard and saw the mother as she said these words, I seemed 
              to hear and see the son, defying them. All that I had ever seen 
              in him of an unyielding, wilful spirit, I saw in her. All the understanding 
              that I had now of his misdirected energy, became an understanding 
              of her character too, and a perception that it was, in its strongest 
              springs, the same. </p>
            <p>　　She now observed to me, aloud, resuming her former restraint, 
              that it was useless to hear more, or to say more, and that she begged 
              to put an end to the interview. She rose with an air of dignity 
              to leave the room, when Mr. Peggotty signified that it was needless. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Doen't fear me being any hindrance to you, I have no more to 
              say, ma'am,' he remarked, as he moved towards the door. 'I come 
              beer with no hope, and I take away no hope. I have done what I thowt 
              should be done, but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan'ning 
              where I do. This has been too evil a house fur me and mine, fur 
              me to be in my right senses and expect it.' </p>
            <p>　　With this, we departed; leaving her standing by her elbow-chair, 
              a picture of a noble presence and a handsome face. </p>
            <p>　　We had, on our way out, to cross a paved hall, with glass sides 
              and roof, over which a vine was trained. Its leaves and shoots were 
              green then, and the day being sunny, a pair of glass doors leading 
              to the garden were thrown open. Rosa Dartle, entering this way with 
              a noiseless step, when we were close to them, addressed herself 
              to me: </p>
            <p>　　'You do well,' she said, 'indeed, to bring this fellow here!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face, 
              and flashed in her jet-black eyes, I could not have thought compressible 
              even into that face. The scar made by the hammer was, as usual in 
              this excited state of her features, strongly marked. When the throbbing 
              I had seen before, came into it as I looked at her, she absolutely 
              lifted up her hand, and struck it. </p>
            <p>　　'This is a fellow,' she said, 'to champion and bring here, is 
              he not? You are a true man!' </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Dartle,' I returned, 'you are surely not so unjust as to 
              condemn ME!' </p>
            <p>　　'Why do you bring division between these two mad creatures?' 
              she returned. 'Don't you know that they are both mad with their 
              own self-will and pride?' </p>
            <p>　　'Is it my doing?' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Is it your doing!' she retorted. 'Why do you bring this man 
              here?' </p>
            <p>　　'He is a deeply-injured man, Miss Dartle,' I replied. 'You may 
              not know it.' </p>
            <p>　　'I know that James Steerforth,' she said, with her hand on her 
              bosom, as if to prevent the storm that was raging there, from being 
              loud, 'has a false, corrupt heart, and is a traitor. But what need 
              I know or care about this fellow, and his common niece?' </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Dartle,' I returned, 'you deepen the injury. It is sufficient 
              already. I will only say, at parting, that you do him a great wrong.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I do him no wrong,' she returned. 'They are a depraved, worthless 
              set. I would have her whipped!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty passed on, without a word, and went out at the door. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, shame, Miss Dartle! shame!' I said indignantly. 'How can 
              you bear to trample on his undeserved affliction!' </p>
            <p>　　'I would trample on them all,' she answered. 'I would have his 
              house pulled down. I would have her branded on the face, dressed 
              in rags, and cast out in the streets to starve. If I had the power 
              to sit in judgement on her, I would see it done. See it done? I 
              would do it! I detest her. If I ever could reproach her with her 
              infamous condition, I would go anywhere to do so. If I could hunt 
              her to her grave, I would. If there was any word of comfort that 
              would be a solace to her in her dying hour, and only I possessed 
              it, I wouldn't part with it for Life itself.' </p>
            <p>　　The mere vehemence of her words can convey, I am sensible, but 
              a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed, and 
              which made itself articulate in her whole figure, though her voice, 
              instead of being raised, was lower than usual. No description I 
              could give of her would do justice to my recollection of her, or 
              to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger. I have seen passion 
              in many forms, but I have never seen it in such a form as that. 
            </p>
            <p>　　When I joined Mr. Peggotty, he was walking slowly and thoughtfully 
              down the hill. He told me, as soon as I came up with him, that having 
              now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in London, 
              he meant 'to set out on his travels', that night. I asked him where 
              he meant to go? He only answered, 'I'm a going, sir, to seek my 
              niece.' </p>
            <p>　　We went back to the little lodging over the chandler's shop, 
              and there I found an opportunity of repeating to Peggotty what he 
              had said to me. She informed me, in return, that he had said the 
              same to her that morning. She knew no more than I did, where he 
              was going, but she thought he had some project shaped out in his 
              mind. </p>
            <p>　　I did not like to leave him, under such circumstances, and we 
              all three dined together off a beefsteak pie - which was one of 
              the many good things for which Peggotty was famous - and which was 
              curiously flavoured on this occasion, I recollect well, by a miscellaneous 
              taste of tea, coffee, butter, bacon, cheese, new loaves, firewood, 
              candles, and walnut ketchup, continually ascending from the shop. 
              After dinner we sat for an hour or so near the window, without talking 
              much; and then Mr. Peggotty got up, and brought his oilskin bag 
              and his stout stick, and laid them on the table. </p>
            <p>　　He accepted, from his sister's stock of ready money, a small 
              sum on account of his legacy; barely enough, I should have thought, 
              to keep him for a month. He promised to communicate with me, when 
              anything befell him; and he slung his bag about him, took his hat 
              and stick, and bade us both 'Good-bye!' </p>
            <p>　　'All good attend you, dear old woman,' he said, embracing Peggotty, 
              'and you too, Mas'r Davy!' shaking hands with me. 'I'm a-going to 
              seek her, fur and wide. If she should come home while I'm away - 
              but ah, that ain't like to be! - or if I should bring her back, 
              my meaning is, that she and me shall live and die where no one can't 
              reproach her. If any hurt should come to me, remember that the last 
              words I left for her was, &quot;My unchanged love is with my darling 
              child, and I forgive her!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　He said this solemnly, bare-headed; then, putting on his hat, 
              he went down the stairs, and away. We followed to the door. It was 
              a warm, dusty evening, just the time when, in the great main thoroughfare 
              out of which that by-way turned, there was a temporary lull in the 
              eternal tread of feet upon the pavement, and a strong red sunshine. 
              He turned, alone, at the corner of our shady street, into a glow 
              of light, in which we lost him. </p>
            <p>　　Rarely did that hour of the evening come, rarely did I wake at 
              night, rarely did I look up at the moon, or stars, or watch the 
              falling rain, or hear the wind, but I thought of his solitary figure 
              toiling on, poor pilgrim, and recalled the words: </p>
            <p>　　'I'm a going to seek her, fur and wide. If any hurt should come 
              to me, remember that the last words I left for her was, &quot;My 
              unchanged love is with my darling child, and I forgive her!&quot;'

            <p>　　 I laboured hard at my book, without allowing it to interfere 
              with the punctual discharge of my newspaper duties; and it came 
              out and was very successful. I was not stunned by the praise which 
              sounded in my ears, notwithstanding that I was keenly alive to it, 
              and thought better of my own performance, I have little doubt, than 
              anybody else did. It has always been in my observation of human 
              nature, that a man who has any good reason to believe in himself 
              never flourishes himself before the faces of other people in order 
              that they may believe in him. For this reason, I retained my modesty 
              in very self-respect; and the more praise I got, the more I tried 
              to deserve. </p>
            <p>　　It is not my purpose, in this record, though in all other essentials 
              it is my written memory, to pursue the history of my own fictions. 
              They express themselves, and I leave them to themselves. When I 
              refer to them, incidentally, it is only as a part of my progress. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Having some foundation for believing, by this time, that nature 
              and accident had made me an author, I pursued my vocation with confidence. 
              Without such assurance I should certainly have left it alone, and 
              bestowed my energy on some other endeavour. I should have tried 
              to find out what nature and accident really had made me, and to 
              be that, and nothing else. I had been writing, in the newspaper 
              and elsewhere, so prosperously, that when my new success was achieved, 
              I considered myself reasonably entitled to escape from the dreary 
              debates. One joyful night, therefore, I noted down the music of 
              the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time, and I have never heard 
              it since; though I still recognize the old drone in the newspapers, 
              without any substantial variation (except, perhaps, that there is 
              more of it), all the livelong session. </p>
            <p>　　I now write of the time when I had been married, I suppose, about 
              a year and a half. After several varieties of experiment, we had 
              given up the housekeeping as a bad job. The house kept itself, and 
              we kept a page. The principal function of this retainer was to quarrel 
              with the cook; in which respect he was a perfect Whittington, without 
              his cat, or the remotest chance of being made Lord Mayor. </p>
            <p>　　He appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepan-lids. His 
              whole existence was a scuffle. He would shriek for help on the most 
              improper occasions, - as when we had a little dinner-party, or a 
              few friends in the evening, - and would come tumbling out of the 
              kitchen, with iron missiles flying after him. We wanted to get rid 
              of him, but he was very much attached to us, and wouldn't go. He 
              was a tearful boy, and broke into such deplorable lamentations, 
              when a cessation of our connexion was hinted at, that we were obliged 
              to keep him. He had no mother - no anything in the way of a relative, 
              that I could discover, except a sister, who fled to America the 
              moment we had taken him off her hands; and he became quartered on 
              us like a horrible young changeling. He had a lively perception 
              of his own unfortunate state, and was always rubbing his eyes with 
              the sleeve of his jacket, or stooping to blow his nose on the extreme 
              corner of a little pocket-handkerchief, which he never would take 
              completely out of his pocket, but always economized and secreted. 
            </p>
            <p>　　This unlucky page, engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten 
              per annum, was a source of continual trouble to me. I watched him 
              as he grew - and he grew like scarlet beans - with painful apprehensions 
              of the time when he would begin to shave; even of the days when 
              he would be bald or grey. I saw no prospect of ever getting rid 
              of him; and, projecting myself into the future, used to think what 
              an inconvenience he would be when he was an old man. </p>
            <p>　　I never expected anything less, than this unfortunate's manner 
              of getting me out of my difficulty. He stole Dora's watch, which, 
              like everything else belonging to us, had no particular place of 
              its own; and, converting it into money, spent the produce (he was 
              always a weak-minded boy) in incessantly riding up and down between 
              London and Uxbridge outside the coach. He was taken to Bow Street, 
              as well as I remember, on the completion of his fifteenth journey; 
              when four-and-sixpence, and a second-hand fife which he couldn't 
              play, were found upon his person. </p>
            <p>　　The surprise and its consequences would have been much less disagreeable 
              to me if he had not been penitent. But he was very penitent indeed, 
              and in a peculiar way - not in the lump, but by instalments. For 
              example: the day after that on which I was obliged to appear against 
              him, he made certain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar, 
              which we believed to be full of wine, but which had nothing in it 
              except bottles and corks. We supposed he had now eased his mind, 
              and told the worst he knew of the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, 
              his conscience sustained a new twinge, and he disclosed how she 
              had a little girl, who, early every morning, took away our bread; 
              and also how he himself had been suborned to maintain the milkman 
              in coals. In two or three days more, I was informed by the authorities 
              of his having led to the discovery of sirloins of beef among the 
              kitchen-stuff, and sheets in the rag-bag. A little while afterwards, 
              he broke out in an entirely new direction, and confessed to a knowledge 
              of burglarious intentions as to our premises, on the part of the 
              pot-boy, who was immediately taken up. I got to be so ashamed of 
              being such a victim, that I would have given him any money to hold 
              his tongue, or would have offered a round bribe for his being permitted 
              to run away. It was an aggravating circumstance in the case that 
              he had no idea of this, but conceived that he was making me amends 
              in every new discovery: not to say, heaping obligations on my head. 
            </p>
            <p>　　At last I ran away myself, whenever I saw an emissary of the 
              police approaching with some new intelligence; and lived a stealthy 
              life until he was tried and ordered to be transported. Even then 
              he couldn't be quiet, but was always writing us letters; and wanted 
              so much to see Dora before he went away, that Dora went to visit 
              him, and fainted when she found herself inside the iron bars. In 
              short, I had no peace of my life until he was expatriated, and made 
              (as I afterwards heard) a shepherd of, 'up the country' somewhere; 
              I have no geographical idea where. </p>
            <p>　　All this led me into some serious reflections, and presented 
              our mistakes in a new aspect; as I could not help communicating 
              to Dora one evening, in spite of my tenderness for her. </p>
            <p>　　'My love,' said I, 'it is very painful to me to think that our 
              want of system and management, involves not only ourselves (which 
              we have got used to), but other people.' </p>
            <p>　　'You have been silent for a long time, and now you are going 
              to be cross!' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'No, my dear, indeed! Let me explain to you what I mean.' </p>
            <p>　　'I think I don't want to know,' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'But I want you to know, my love. Put Jip down.' </p>
            <p>　　Dora put his nose to mine, and said 'Boh!' to drive my seriousness 
              away; but, not succeeding, ordered him into his Pagoda, and sat 
              looking at me, with her hands folded, and a most resigned little 
              expression of countenance. </p>
            <p>　　'The fact is, my dear,' I began, 'there is contagion in us. We 
              infect everyone about us.' </p>
            <p>　　I might have gone on in this figurative manner, if Dora's face 
              had not admonished me that she was wondering with all her might 
              whether I was going to propose any new kind of vaccination, or other 
              medical remedy, for this unwholesome state of ours. Therefore I 
              checked myself, and made my meaning plainer. </p>
            <p>　　'It is not merely, my pet,' said I, 'that we lose money and comfort, 
              and even temper sometimes, by not learning to be more careful; but 
              that we incur the serious responsibility of spoiling everyone who 
              comes into our service, or has any dealings with us. I begin to 
              be afraid that the fault is not entirely on one side, but that these 
              people all turn out ill because we don't turn out very well ourselves.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what an accusation,' exclaimed Dora, opening her eyes wide; 
              'to say that you ever saw me take gold watches! Oh!' </p>
            <p>　　'My dearest,' I remonstrated, 'don't talk preposterous nonsense! 
              Who has made the least allusion to gold watches?' </p>
            <p>　　'You did,' returned Dora. 'You know you did. You said I hadn't 
              turned out well, and compared me to him.' </p>
            <p>　　'To whom?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'To the page,' sobbed Dora. 'Oh, you cruel fellow, to compare 
              your affectionate wife to a transported page! Why didn't you tell 
              me your opinion of me before we were married? Why didn't you say, 
              you hard-hearted thing, that you were convinced I was worse than 
              a transported page? Oh, what a dreadful opinion to have of me! Oh, 
              my goodness!' </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Dora, my love,' I returned, gently trying to remove the 
              handkerchief she pressed to her eyes, 'this is not only very ridiculous 
              of you, but very wrong. In the first place, it's not true.' </p>
            <p>　　'You always said he was a story-teller,' sobbed Dora. 'And now 
              you say the same of me! Oh, what shall I do! What shall I do!' </p>
            <p>　　'My darling girl,' I retorted, 'I really must entreat you to 
              be reasonable, and listen to what I did say, and do say. My dear 
              Dora, unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ, they 
              will never learn to do their duty to us. I am afraid we present 
              opportunities to people to do wrong, that never ought to be presented. 
              Even if we were as lax as we are, in all our arrangements, by choice 
              - which we are not - even if we liked it, and found it agreeable 
              to be so - which we don't - I am persuaded we should have no right 
              to go on in this way. We are positively corrupting people. We are 
              bound to think of that. I can't help thinking of it, Dora. It is 
              a reflection I am unable to dismiss, and it sometimes makes me very 
              uneasy. There, dear, that's all. Come now. Don't be foolish!' </p>
            <p>　　Dora would not allow me, for a long time, to remove the handkerchief. 
              She sat sobbing and murmuring behind it, that, if I was uneasy, 
              why had I ever been married? Why hadn't I said, even the day before 
              we went to church, that I knew I should be uneasy, and I would rather 
              not? If I couldn't bear her, why didn't I send her away to her aunts 
              at Putney, or to Julia Mills in India? Julia would be glad to see 
              her, and would not call her a transported page; Julia never had 
              called her anything of the sort. In short, Dora was so afflicted, 
              and so afflicted me by being in that condition, that I felt it was 
              of no use repeating this kind of effort, though never so mildly, 
              and I must take some other course. </p>
            <p>　　What other course was left to take? To 'form her mind'? This 
              was a common phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound, 
              and I resolved to form Dora's mind. </p>
            <p>　　I began immediately. When Dora was very childish, and I would 
              have infinitely preferred to humour her, I tried to be grave - and 
              disconcerted her, and myself too. I talked to her on the subjects 
              which occupied my thoughts; and I read Shakespeare to her - and 
              fatigued her to the last degree. I accustomed myself to giving her, 
              as it were quite casually, little scraps of useful information, 
              or sound opinion - and she started from them when I let them off, 
              as if they had been crackers. No matter how incidentally or naturally 
              I endeavoured to form my little wife's mind, I could not help seeing 
              that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about, 
              and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions. In particular, it 
              was clear to me, that she thought Shakespeare a terrible fellow. 
              The formation went on very slowly. </p>
            <p>　　I pressed Traddles into the service without his knowledge; and 
              whenever he came to see us, exploded my mines upon him for the edification 
              of Dora at second hand. The amount of practical wisdom I bestowed 
              upon Traddles in this manner was immense, and of the best quality; 
              but it had no other effect upon Dora than to depress her spirits, 
              and make her always nervous with the dread that it would be her 
              turn next. I found myself in the condition of a schoolmaster, a 
              trap, a pitfall; of always playing spider to Dora's fly, and always 
              pouncing out of my hole to her infinite disturbance. </p>
            <p>　　Still, looking forward through this intermediate stage, to the 
              time when there should be a perfect sympathy between Dora and me, 
              and when I should have 'formed her mind' to my entire satisfaction, 
              I persevered, even for months. Finding at last, however, that, although 
              I had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog, bristling 
              all over with determination, I had effected nothing, it began to 
              occur to me that perhaps Dora's mind was already formed. </p>
            <p>　　On further consideration this appeared so likely, that I abandoned 
              my scheme, which had had a more promising appearance in words than 
              in action; resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife, 
              and to try to change her into nothing else by any process. I was 
              heartily tired of being sagacious and prudent by myself, and of 
              seeing my darling under restraint; so I bought a pretty pair of 
              ear-rings for her, and a collar for Jip, and went home one day to 
              make myself agreeable. </p>
            <p>　　Dora was delighted with the little presents, and kissed me joyfully; 
              but there was a shadow between us, however slight, and I had made 
              up my mind that it should not be there. If there must be such a 
              shadow anywhere, I would keep it for the future in my own breast. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I sat down by my wife on the sofa, and put the ear-rings in her 
              ears; and then I told her that I feared we had not been quite as 
              good company lately, as we used to be, and that the fault was mine. 
              Which I sincerely felt, and which indeed it was. </p>
            <p>　　'The truth is, Dora, my life,' I said; 'I have been trying to 
              be wise.' </p>
            <p>　　'And to make me wise too,' said Dora, timidly. 'Haven't you, 
              Doady?' </p>
            <p>　　I nodded assent to the pretty inquiry of the raised eyebrows, 
              and kissed the parted lips. </p>
            <p>　　'It's of not a bit of use,' said Dora, shaking her head, until 
              the ear-rings rang again. 'You know what a little thing I am, and 
              what I wanted you to call me from the first. If you can't do so, 
              I am afraid you'll never like me. Are you sure you don't think, 
              sometimes, it would have been better to have -' </p>
            <p>　　'Done what, my dear?' For she made no effort to proceed. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing!' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing?' I repeated. </p>
            <p>　　She put her arms round my neck, and laughed, and called herself 
              by her favourite name of a goose, and hid her face on my shoulder 
              in such a profusion of curls that it was quite a task to clear them 
              away and see it. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't I think it would have been better to have done nothing, 
              than to have tried to form my little wife's mind?' said I, laughing 
              at myself. 'Is that the question? Yes, indeed, I do.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is that what you have been trying?' cried Dora. 'Oh what a shocking 
              boy!' </p>
            <p>　　'But I shall never try any more,' said I. 'For I love her dearly 
              as she is.' </p>
            <p>　　'Without a story - really?' inquired Dora, creeping closer to 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　'Why should I seek to change,' said I, 'what has been so precious 
              to me for so long! You never can show better than as your own natural 
              self, my sweet Dora; and we'll try no conceited experiments, but 
              go back to our old way, and be happy.' </p>
            <p>　　'And be happy!' returned Dora. 'Yes! All day! And you won't mind 
              things going a tiny morsel wrong, sometimes?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' said I. 'We must do the best we can.' </p>
            <p>　　'And you won't tell me, any more, that we make other people bad,' 
              coaxed Dora; 'will you? Because you know it's so dreadfully cross!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'it's better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable, isn't it?' 
              said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'Better to be naturally Dora than anything else in the world.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'In the world! Ah, Doady, it's a large place!' </p>
            <p>　　She shook her head, turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine, 
              kissed me, broke into a merry laugh, and sprang away to put on Jip's 
              new collar. </p>
            <p>　　So ended my last attempt to make any change in Dora. I had been 
              unhappy in trying it; I could not endure my own solitary wisdom; 
              I could not reconcile it with her former appeal to me as my child-wife. 
              I resolved to do what I could, in a quiet way, to improve our proceedings 
              myself, but I foresaw that my utmost would be very little, or I 
              must degenerate into the spider again, and be for ever lying in 
              wait. </p>
            <p>　　And the shadow I have mentioned, that was not to be between us 
              any more, but was to rest wholly on my own heart? How did that fall? 
            </p>
            <p>　　The old unhappy feeling pervaded my life. It was deepened, if 
              it were changed at all; but it was as undefined as ever, and addressed 
              me like a strain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night. 
              I loved my wife dearly, and I was happy; but the happiness I had 
              vaguely anticipated, once, was not the happiness I enjoyed, and 
              there was always something wanting. </p>
            <p>　　In fulfilment of the compact I have made with myself, to reflect 
              my mind on this paper, I again examine it, closely, and bring its 
              secrets to the light. What I missed, I still regarded - I always 
              regarded - as something that had been a dream of my youthful fancy; 
              that was incapable of realization; that I was now discovering to 
              be so, with some natural pain, as all men did. But that it would 
              have been better for me if my wife could have helped me more, and 
              shared the many thoughts in which I had no partner; and that this 
              might have been; I knew. </p>
            <p>　　Between these two irreconcilable conclusions: the one, that what 
              I felt was general and unavoidable; the other, that it was particular 
              to me, and might have been different: I balanced curiously, with 
              no distinct sense of their opposition to each other. When I thought 
              of the airy dreams of youth that are incapable of realization, I 
              thought of the better state preceding manhood that I had outgrown; 
              and then the contented days with Agnes, in the dear old house, arose 
              before me, like spectres of the dead, that might have some renewal 
              in another world, but never more could be reanimated here. </p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, the speculation came into my thoughts, What might 
              have happened, or what would have happened, if Dora and I had never 
              known each other? But she was so incorporated with my existence, 
              that it was the idlest of all fancies, and would soon rise out of 
              my reach and sight, like gossamer floating in the air. </p>
            <p>　　I always loved her. What I am describing, slumbered, and half 
              awoke, and slept again, in the innermost recesses of my mind. There 
              was no evidence of it in me; I know of no influence it had in anything 
              I said or did. I bore the weight of all our little cares, and all 
              my projects; Dora held the pens; and we both felt that our shares 
              were adjusted as the case required. She was truly fond of me, and 
              proud of me; and when Agnes wrote a few earnest words in her letters 
              to Dora, of the pride and interest with which my old friends heard 
              of my growing reputation, and read my book as if they heard me speaking 
              its contents, Dora read them out to me with tears of joy in her 
              bright eyes, and said I was a dear old clever, famous boy. </p>
            <p>　　'The first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart.' Those 
              words of Mrs. Strong's were constantly recurring to me, at this 
              time; were almost always present to my mind. I awoke with them, 
              often, in the night; I remember to have even read them, in dreams, 
              inscribed upon the walls of houses. For I knew, now, that my own 
              heart was undisciplined when it first loved Dora; and that if it 
              had been disciplined, it never could have felt, when we were married, 
              what it had felt in its secret experience. </p>
            <p>　　'There can be no disparity in marriage, like unsuitability of 
              mind and purpose.' Those words I remembered too. I had endeavoured 
              to adapt Dora to myself, and found it impracticable. It remained 
              for me to adapt myself to Dora; to share with her what I could, 
              and be happy; to bear on my own shoulders what I must, and be happy 
              still. This was the discipline to which I tried to bring my heart, 
              when I began to think. It made my second year much happier than 
              my first; and, what was better still, made Dora's life all sunshine. 
            </p>
            <p>　　But, as that year wore on, Dora was not strong. I had hoped that 
              lighter hands than mine would help to mould her character, and that 
              a baby-smile upon her breast might change my child-wife to a woman. 
              It was not to be. The spirit fluttered for a moment on the threshold 
              of its little prison, and, unconscious of captivity, took wing. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'When I can run about again, as I used to do, aunt,' said Dora, 
              'I shall make Jip race. He is getting quite slow and lazy.' </p>
            <p>　　'I suspect, my dear,' said my aunt quietly working by her side, 
              'he has a worse disorder than that. Age, Dora.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you think he is old?' said Dora, astonished. 'Oh, how strange 
              it seems that Jip should be old!' </p>
            <p>　　'It's a complaint we are all liable to, Little One, as we get 
              on in life,' said my aunt, cheerfully; 'I don't feel more free from 
              it than I used to be, I assure you.' </p>
            <p>　　'But Jip,' said Dora, looking at him with compassion, 'even little 
              Jip! Oh, poor fellow!' </p>
            <p>　　'I dare say he'll last a long time yet, Blossom,' said my aunt, 
              patting Dora on the cheek, as she leaned out of her couch to look 
              at Jip, who responded by standing on his hind legs, and baulking 
              himself in various asthmatic attempts to scramble up by the head 
              and shoulders. 'He must have a piece of flannel in his house this 
              winter, and I shouldn't wonder if he came out quite fresh again, 
              with the flowers in the spring. Bless the little dog!' exclaimed 
              my aunt, 'if he had as many lives as a cat, and was on the point 
              of losing 'em all, he'd bark at me with his last breath, I believe!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Dora had helped him up on the sofa; where he really was defying 
              my aunt to such a furious extent, that he couldn't keep straight, 
              but barked himself sideways. The more my aunt looked at him, the 
              more he reproached her; for she had lately taken to spectacles, 
              and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Dora made him lie down by her, with a good deal of persuasion; 
              and when he was quiet, drew one of his long ears through and through 
              her hand, repeating thoughtfully, 'Even little Jip! Oh, poor fellow!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'His lungs are good enough,' said my aunt, gaily, 'and his dislikes 
              are not at all feeble. He has a good many years before him, no doubt. 
              But if you want a dog to race with, Little Blossom, he has lived 
              too well for that, and I'll give you one.' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, aunt,' said Dora, faintly. 'But don't, please!' </p>
            <p>　　'No?' said my aunt, taking off her spectacles. </p>
            <p>　　'I couldn't have any other dog but Jip,' said Dora. 'It would 
              be so unkind to Jip! Besides, I couldn't be such friends with any 
              other dog but Jip; because he wouldn't have known me before I was 
              married, and wouldn't have barked at Doady when he first came to 
              our house. I couldn't care for any other dog but Jip, I am afraid, 
              aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'To be sure!' said my aunt, patting her cheek again. 'You are 
              right.' </p>
            <p>　　'You are not offended,' said Dora. 'Are you?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, what a sensitive pet it is!' cried my aunt, bending over 
              her affectionately. 'To think that I could be offended!' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, I didn't really think so,' returned Dora; 'but I am 
              a little tired, and it made me silly for a moment - I am always 
              a silly little thing, you know, but it made me more silly - to talk 
              about Jip. He has known me in all that has happened to me, haven't 
              you, Jip? And I couldn't bear to slight him, because he was a little 
              altered - could I, Jip?' </p>
            <p>　　Jip nestled closer to his mistress, and lazily licked her hand. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You are not so old, Jip, are you, that you'll leave your mistress 
              yet?' said Dora. 'We may keep one another company a little longer!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　My pretty Dora! When she came down to dinner on the ensuing Sunday, 
              and was so glad to see old Traddles (who always dined with us on 
              Sunday), we thought she would be 'running about as she used to do', 
              in a few days. But they said, wait a few days more; and then, wait 
              a few days more; and still she neither ran nor walked. She looked 
              very pretty, and was very merry; but the little feet that used to 
              be so nimble when they danced round Jip, were dull and motionless. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I began to carry her downstairs every morning, and upstairs every 
              night. She would clasp me round the neck and laugh, the while, as 
              if I did it for a wager. Jip would bark and caper round us, and 
              go on before, and look back on the landing, breathing short, to 
              see that we were coming. My aunt, the best and most cheerful of 
              nurses, would trudge after us, a moving mass of shawls and pillows. 
              Mr. Dick would not have relinquished his post of candle-bearer to 
              anyone alive. Traddles would be often at the bottom of the staircase, 
              looking on, and taking charge of sportive messages from Dora to 
              the dearest girl in the world. We made quite a gay procession of 
              it, and my child-wife was the gayest there. </p>
            <p>　　But, sometimes, when I took her up, and felt that she was lighter 
              in my arms, a dead blank feeling came upon me, as if I were approaching 
              to some frozen region yet unseen, that numbed my life. I avoided 
              the recognition of this feeling by any name, or by any communing 
              with myself; until one night, when it was very strong upon me, and 
              my aunt had left her with a parting cry of 'Good night, Little Blossom,' 
              I sat down at my desk alone, and cried to think, Oh what a fatal 
              name it was, and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the 
              tree! </p>

            <p>　　 For anything I know, I may have had some wild idea of running 
              all the way to Dover, when I gave up the pursuit of the young man 
              with the donkey-cart, and started for Greenwich. My scattered senses 
              were soon collected as to that point, if I had; for I came to a 
              stop in the Kent Road, at a terrace with a piece of water before 
              it, and a great foolish image in the middle, blowing a dry shell. 
              Here I sat down on a doorstep, quite spent and exhausted with the 
              efforts I had already made, and with hardly breath enough to cry 
              for the loss of my box and half-guinea. </p>
            <p>　　It was by this time dark; I heard the clocks strike ten, as I 
              sat resting. But it was a summer night, fortunately, and fine weather. 
              When I had recovered my breath, and had got rid of a stifling sensation 
              in my throat, I rose up and went on. In the midst of my distress, 
              I had no notion of going back. I doubt if I should have had any, 
              though there had been a Swiss snow-drift in the Kent Road. </p>
            <p>　　But my standing possessed of only three-halfpence in the world 
              (and I am sure I wonder how they came to be left in my pocket on 
              a Saturday night!) troubled me none the less because I went on. 
              I began to picture to myself, as a scrap of newspaper intelligence, 
              my being found dead in a day or two, under some hedge; and I trudged 
              on miserably, though as fast as I could, until I happened to pass 
              a little shop, where it was written up that ladies' and gentlemen's 
              wardrobes were bought, and that the best price was given for rags, 
              bones, and kitchen-stuff. The master of this shop was sitting at 
              the door in his shirt-sleeves, smoking; and as there were a great 
              many coats and pairs of trousers dangling from the low ceiling, 
              and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what they were, 
              I fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful disposition, 
              who had hung all his enemies, and was enjoying himself. </p>
            <p>　　My late experiences with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber suggested to me 
              that here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little 
              while. I went up the next by-street, took off my waistcoat, rolled 
              it neatly under my arm, and came back to the shop door. </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, sir,' I said, 'I am to sell this for a fair price.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dolloby - Dolloby was the name over the shop door, at least 
              - took the waistcoat, stood his pipe on its head, against the door-post, 
              went into the shop, followed by me, snuffed the two candles with 
              his fingers, spread the waistcoat on the counter, and looked at 
              it there, held it up against the light, and looked at it there, 
              and ultimately said: </p>
            <p>　　'What do you call a price, now, for this here little weskit?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! you know best, sir,' I returned modestly. </p>
            <p>　　'I can't be buyer and seller too,' said Mr. Dolloby. 'Put a price 
              on this here little weskit.' </p>
            <p>　　'Would eighteenpence be?'- I hinted, after some hesitation. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again, and gave it me back. 'I should 
              rob my family,' he said, 'if I was to offer ninepence for it.' </p>
            <p>　　This was a disagreeable way of putting the business; because 
              it imposed upon me, a perfect stranger, the unpleasantness of asking 
              Mr. Dolloby to rob his family on my account. My circumstances being 
              so very pressing, however, I said I would take ninepence for it, 
              if he pleased. Mr. Dolloby, not without some grumbling, gave ninepence. 
              I wished him good night, and walked out of the shop the richer by 
              that sum, and the poorer by a waistcoat. But when I buttoned my 
              jacket, that was not much. Indeed, I foresaw pretty clearly that 
              my jacket would go next, and that I should have to make the best 
              of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers, and might 
              deem myself lucky if I got there even in that trim. But my mind 
              did not run so much on this as might be supposed. Beyond a general 
              impression of the distance before me, and of the young man with 
              the donkey-cart having used me cruelly, I think I had no very urgent 
              sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence 
              in my pocket. </p>
            <p>　　A plan had occurred to me for passing the night, which I was 
              going to carry into execution. This was, to lie behind the wall 
              at the back of my old school, in a corner where there used to be 
              a haystack. I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the 
              boys, and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories, so near 
              me: although the boys would know nothing of my being there, and 
              the bedroom would yield me no shelter. </p>
            <p>　　I had had a hard day's work, and was pretty well jaded when I 
              came climbing out, at last, upon the level of Blackheath. It cost 
              me some trouble to find out Salem House; but I found it, and I found 
              a haystack in the corner, and I lay down by it; having first walked 
              round the wall, and looked up at the windows, and seen that all 
              was dark and silent within. Never shall I forget the lonely sensation 
              of first lying down, without a roof above my head! </p>
            <p>　　Sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts, against 
              whom house-doors were locked, and house-dogs barked, that night 
              - and I dreamed of lying on my old school-bed, talking to the boys 
              in my room; and found myself sitting upright, with Steerforth's 
              name upon my lips, looking wildly at the stars that were glistening 
              and glimmering above me. When I remembered where I was at that untimely 
              hour, a feeling stole upon me that made me get up, afraid of I don't 
              know what, and walk about. But the fainter glimmering of the stars, 
              and the pale light in the sky where the day was coming, reassured 
              me: and my eyes being very heavy, I lay down again and slept - though 
              with a knowledge in my sleep that it was cold - until the warm beams 
              of the sun, and the ringing of the getting-up bell at Salem House, 
              awoke me. If I could have hoped that Steerforth was there, I would 
              have lurked about until he came out alone; but I knew he must have 
              left long since. Traddles still remained, perhaps, but it was very 
              doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discretion 
              or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his good nature, 
              to wish to trust him with my situation. So I crept away from the 
              wall as Mr. Creakle's boys were getting up, and struck into the 
              long dusty track which I had first known to be the Dover Road when 
              I was one of them, and when I little expected that any eyes would 
              ever see me the wayfarer I was now, upon it. </p>
            <p>　　What a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at 
              Yarmouth! In due time I heard the church-bells ringing, as I plodded 
              on; and I met people who were going to church; and I passed a church 
              or two where the congregation were inside, and the sound of singing 
              came out into the sunshine, while the beadle sat and cooled himself 
              in the shade of the porch, or stood beneath the yew-tree, with his 
              hand to his forehead, glowering at me going by. But the peace and 
              rest of the old Sunday morning were on everything, except me. That 
              was the difference. I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust, with 
              my tangled hair. But for the quiet picture I had conjured up, of 
              my mother in her youth and beauty, weeping by the fire, and my aunt 
              relenting to her, I hardly think I should have had the courage to 
              go on until next day. But it always went before me, and I followed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I got, that Sunday, through three-and-twenty miles on the straight 
              road, though not very easily, for I was new to that kind of toil. 
              I see myself, as evening closes in, coming over the bridge at Rochester, 
              footsore and tired, and eating bread that I had bought for supper. 
              One or two little houses, with the notice, 'Lodgings for Travellers', 
              hanging out, had tempted me; but I was afraid of spending the few 
              pence I had, and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the 
              trampers I had met or overtaken. I sought no shelter, therefore, 
              but the sky; and toiling into Chatham, - which, in that night's 
              aspect, is a mere dream of chalk, and drawbridges, and mastless 
              ships in a muddy river, roofed like Noah's arks, - crept, at last, 
              upon a sort of grass-grown battery overhanging a lane, where a sentry 
              was walking to and fro. Here I lay down, near a cannon; and, happy 
              in the society of the sentry's footsteps, though he knew no more 
              of my being above him than the boys at Salem House had known of 
              my lying by the wall, slept soundly until morning. </p>
            <p>　　Very stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning, and quite dazed 
              by the beating of drums and marching of troops, which seemed to 
              hem me in on every side when I went down towards the long narrow 
              street. Feeling that I could go but a very little way that day, 
              if I were to reserve any strength for getting to my journey's end, 
              I resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business. 
              Accordingly, I took the jacket off, that I might learn to do without 
              it; and carrying it under my arm, began a tour of inspection of 
              the various slop-shops. </p>
            <p>　　It was a likely place to sell a jacket in; for the dealers in 
              second-hand clothes were numerous, and were, generally speaking, 
              on the look-out for customers at their shop doors. But as most of 
              them had, hanging up among their stock, an officer's coat or two, 
              epaulettes and all, I was rendered timid by the costly nature of 
              their dealings, and walked about for a long time without offering 
              my merchandise to anyone. </p>
            <p>　　This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store 
              shops, and such shops as Mr. Dolloby's, in preference to the regular 
              dealers. At last I found one that I thought looked promising, at 
              the corner of a dirty lane, ending in an enclosure full of stinging-nettles, 
              against the palings of which some second-hand sailors' clothes, 
              that seemed to have overflowed the shop, were fluttering among some 
              cots, and rusty guns, and oilskin hats, and certain trays full of 
              so many old rusty keys of so many sizes that they seemed various 
              enough to open all the doors in the world. </p>
            <p>　　Into this shop, which was low and small, and which was darkened 
              rather than lighted by a little window, overhung with clothes, and 
              was descended into by some steps, I went with a palpitating heart; 
              which was not relieved when an ugly old man, with the lower part 
              of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard, rushed out of 
              a dirty den behind it, and seized me by the hair of my head. He 
              was a dreadful old man to look at, in a filthy flannel waistcoat, 
              and smelling terribly of rum. His bedstead, covered with a tumbled 
              and ragged piece of patchwork, was in the den he had come from, 
              where another little window showed a prospect of more stinging-nettles, 
              and a lame donkey. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what do you want?' grinned this old man, in a fierce, monotonous 
              whine. 'Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want? Oh, my lungs and 
              liver, what do you want? Oh, goroo, goroo!' </p>
            <p>　　I was so much dismayed by these words, and particularly by the 
              repetition of the last unknown one, which was a kind of rattle in 
              his throat, that I could make no answer; hereupon the old man, still 
              holding me by the hair, repeated: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what do you want? Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want? 
              Oh, my lungs and liver, what do you want? Oh, goroo!' - which he 
              screwed out of himself, with an energy that made his eyes start 
              in his head. </p>
            <p>　　'I wanted to know,' I said, trembling, 'if you would buy a jacket.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, let's see the jacket!' cried the old man. 'Oh, my heart 
              on fire, show the jacket to us! Oh, my eyes and limbs, bring the 
              jacket out!' </p>
            <p>　　With that he took his trembling hands, which were like the claws 
              of a great bird, out of my hair; and put on a pair of spectacles, 
              not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, how much for the jacket?' cried the old man, after examining 
              it. 'Oh - goroo! - how much for the jacket?' </p>
            <p>　　'Half-a-crown,' I answered, recovering myself. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, my lungs and liver,' cried the old man, 'no! Oh, my eyes, 
              no! Oh, my limbs, no! Eighteenpence. Goroo!' </p>
            <p>　　Every time he uttered this ejaculation, his eyes seemed to be 
              in danger of starting out; and every sentence he spoke, he delivered 
              in a sort of tune, always exactly the same, and more like a gust 
              of wind, which begins low, mounts up high, and falls again, than 
              any other comparison I can find for it. </p>
            <p>　　'Well,' said I, glad to have closed the bargain, 'I'll take eighteenpence.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, my liver!' cried the old man, throwing the jacket on a shelf. 
              'Get out of the shop! Oh, my lungs, get out of the shop! Oh, my 
              eyes and limbs - goroo! - don't ask for money; make it an exchange.' 
              I never was so frightened in my life, before or since; but I told 
              him humbly that I wanted money, and that nothing else was of any 
              use to me, but that I would wait for it, as he desired, outside, 
              and had no wish to hurry him. So I went outside, and sat down in 
              the shade in a corner. And I sat there so many hours, that the shade 
              became sunlight, and the sunlight became shade again, and still 
              I sat there waiting for the money. </p>
            <p>　　There never was such another drunken madman in that line of business, 
              I hope. That he was well known in the neighbourhood, and enjoyed 
              the reputation of having sold himself to the devil, I soon understood 
              from the visits he received from the boys, who continually came 
              skirmishing about the shop, shouting that legend, and calling to 
              him to bring out his gold. 'You ain't poor, you know, Charley, as 
              you pretend. Bring out your gold. Bring out some of the gold you 
              sold yourself to the devil for. Come! It's in the lining of the 
              mattress, Charley. Rip it open and let's have some!' This, and many 
              offers to lend him a knife for the purpose, exasperated him to such 
              a degree, that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part, 
              and flights on the part of the boys. Sometimes in his rage he would 
              take me for one of them, and come at me, mouthing as if he were 
              going to tear me in pieces; then, remembering me, just in time, 
              would dive into the shop, and lie upon his bed, as I thought from 
              the sound of his voice, yelling in a frantic way, to his own windy 
              tune, the 'Death of Nelson'; with an Oh! before every line, and 
              innumerable Goroos interspersed. As if this were not bad enough 
              for me, the boys, connecting me with the establishment, on account 
              of the patience and perseverance with which I sat outside, half-dressed, 
              pelted me, and used me very ill all day. </p>
            <p>　　He made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange; 
              at one time coming out with a fishing-rod, at another with a fiddle, 
              at another with a cocked hat, at another with a flute. But I resisted 
              all these overtures, and sat there in desperation; each time asking 
              him, with tears in my eyes, for my money or my jacket. At last he 
              began to pay me in halfpence at a time; and was full two hours getting 
              by easy stages to a shilling. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, my eyes and limbs!' he then cried, peeping hideously out 
              of the shop, after a long pause, 'will you go for twopence more?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I can't,' I said; 'I shall be starved.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, my lungs and liver, will you go for threepence?' </p>
            <p>　　'I would go for nothing, if I could,' I said, 'but I want the 
              money badly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, go-roo!' (it is really impossible to express how he twisted 
              this ejaculation out of himself, as he peeped round the door-post 
              at me, showing nothing but his crafty old head); 'will you go for 
              fourpence?' </p>
            <p>　　I was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer; and taking 
              the money out of his claw, not without trembling, went away more 
              hungry and thirsty than I had ever been, a little before sunset. 
              But at an expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely; 
              and, being in better spirits then, limped seven miles upon my road. 
            </p>
            <p>　　My bed at night was under another haystack, where I rested comfortably, 
              after having washed my blistered feet in a stream, and dressed them 
              as well as I was able, with some cool leaves. When I took the road 
              again next morning, I found that it lay through a succession of 
              hop-grounds and orchards. It was sufficiently late in the year for 
              the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples; and in a few places the 
              hop-pickers were already at work. I thought it all extremely beautiful, 
              and made up my mind to sleep among the hops that night: imagining 
              some cheerful companionship in the long perspectives of poles, with 
              the graceful leaves twining round them. </p>
            <p>　　The trampers were worse than ever that day, and inspired me with 
              a dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind. Some of them were most 
              ferocious-looking ruffians, who stared at me as I went by; and stopped, 
              perhaps, and called after me to come back and speak to them, and 
              when I took to my heels, stoned me. I recollect one young fellow 
              - a tinker, I suppose, from his wallet and brazier - who had a woman 
              with him, and who faced about and stared at me thus; and then roared 
              to me in such a tremendous voice to come back, that I halted and 
              looked round. </p>
            <p>　　'Come here, when you're called,' said the tinker, 'or I'll rip 
              your young body open.' </p>
            <p>　　I thought it best to go back. As I drew nearer to them, trying 
              to propitiate the tinker by my looks, I observed that the woman 
              had a black eye. </p>
            <p>　　'Where are you going?' said the tinker, gripping the bosom of 
              my shirt with his blackened hand. </p>
            <p>　　'I am going to Dover,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Where do you come from?' asked the tinker, giving his hand another 
              turn in my shirt, to hold me more securely. </p>
            <p>　　'I come from London,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'What lay are you upon?' asked the tinker. 'Are you a prig?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'N-no,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Ain't you, by G--? If you make a brag of your honesty to me,' 
              said the tinker, 'I'll knock your brains out.' </p>
            <p>　　With his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me, and 
              then looked at me from head to foot. </p>
            <p>　　'Have you got the price of a pint of beer about you?' said the 
              tinker. 'If you have, out with it, afore I take it away!' </p>
            <p>　　I should certainly have produced it, but that I met the woman's 
              look, and saw her very slightly shake her head, and form 'No!' with 
              her lips. </p>
            <p>　　'I am very poor,' I said, attempting to smile, 'and have got 
              no money.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, what do you mean?' said the tinker, looking so sternly 
              at me, that I almost feared he saw the money in my pocket. </p>
            <p>　　'Sir!' I stammered. </p>
            <p>　　'What do you mean,' said the tinker, 'by wearing my brother's 
              silk handkerchief! Give it over here!' And he had mine off my neck 
              in a moment, and tossed it to the woman. </p>
            <p>　　The woman burst into a fit of laughter, as if she thought this 
              a joke, and tossed it back to me, nodded once, as slightly as before, 
              and made the word 'Go!' with her lips. Before I could obey, however, 
              the tinker seized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness 
              that threw me away like a feather, and putting it loosely round 
              his own neck, turned upon the woman with an oath, and knocked her 
              down. I never shall forget seeing her fall backward on the hard 
              road, and lie there with her bonnet tumbled off, and her hair all 
              whitened in the dust; nor, when I looked back from a distance, seeing 
              her sitting on the pathway, which was a bank by the roadside, wiping 
              the blood from her face with a corner of her shawl, while he went 
              on ahead. </p>
            <p>　　This adventure frightened me so, that, afterwards, when I saw 
              any of these people coming, I turned back until I could find a hiding-place, 
              where I remained until they had gone out of sight; which happened 
              so often, that I was very seriously delayed. But under this difficulty, 
              as under all the other difficulties of my journey, I seemed to be 
              sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her 
              youth, before I came into the world. It always kept me company. 
              It was there, among the hops, when I lay down to sleep; it was with 
              me on my waking in the morning; it went before me all day. I have 
              associated it, ever since, with the sunny street of Canterbury, 
              dozing as it were in the hot light; and with the sight of its old 
              houses and gateways, and the stately, grey Cathedral, with the rooks 
              sailing round the towers. When I came, at last, upon the bare, wide 
              downs near Dover, it relieved the solitary aspect of the scene with 
              hope; and not until I reached that first great aim of my journey, 
              and actually set foot in the town itself, on the sixth day of my 
              flight, did it desert me. But then, strange to say, when I stood 
              with my ragged shoes, and my dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed figure, 
              in the place so long desired, it seemed to vanish like a dream, 
              and to leave me helpless and dispirited. </p>
            <p>　　I inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first, and received 
              various answers. One said she lived in the South Foreland Light, 
              and had singed her whiskers by doing so; another, that she was made 
              fast to the great buoy outside the harbour, and could only be visited 
              at half-tide; a third, that she was locked up in Maidstone jail 
              for child-stealing; a fourth, that she was seen to mount a broom 
              in the last high wind, and make direct for Calais. The fly-drivers, 
              among whom I inquired next, were equally jocose and equally disrespectful; 
              and the shopkeepers, not liking my appearance, generally replied, 
              without hearing what I had to say, that they had got nothing for 
              me. I felt more miserable and destitute than I had done at any period 
              of my running away. My money was all gone, I had nothing left to 
              dispose of; I was hungry, thirsty, and worn out; and seemed as distant 
              from my end as if I had remained in London. </p>

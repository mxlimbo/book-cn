            <p>　　 It was yet early in the morning of the following day, when, 
              as I was walking in my garden with my aunt (who took little other 
              exercise now, being so much in attendance on my dear Dora), I was 
              told that Mr. Peggotty desired to speak with me. He came into the 
              garden to meet me half-way, on my going towards the gate; and bared 
              his head, as it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt, 
              for whom he had a high respect. I had been telling her all that 
              had happened overnight. Without saying a word, she walked up with 
              a cordial face, shook hands with him, and patted him on the arm. 
              It was so expressively done, that she had no need to say a word. 
              Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I'll go in now, Trot,' said my aunt, 'and look after Little 
              Blossom, who will be getting up presently.' </p>
            <p>　　'Not along of my being heer, ma'am, I hope?' said Mr. Peggotty. 
              'Unless my wits is gone a bahd's neezing' - by which Mr. Peggotty 
              meant to say, bird's-nesting - 'this morning, 'tis along of me as 
              you're a-going to quit us?' </p>
            <p>　　'You have something to say, my good friend,' returned my aunt, 
              'and will do better without me.' </p>
            <p>　　'By your leave, ma'am,' returned Mr. Peggotty, 'I should take 
              it kind, pervising you doen't mind my clicketten, if you'd bide 
              heer.' </p>
            <p>　　'Would you?' said my aunt, with short good-nature. 'Then I am 
              sure I will!' </p>
            <p>　　So, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty's, and walked with 
              him to a leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the 
              garden, where she sat down on a bench, and I beside her. There was 
              a seat for Mr. Peggotty too, but he preferred to stand, leaning 
              his hand on the small rustic table. As he stood, looking at his 
              cap for a little while before beginning to speak, I could not help 
              observing what power and force of character his sinewy hand expressed, 
              and what a good and trusty companion it was to his honest brow and 
              iron-grey hair. </p>
            <p>　　'I took my dear child away last night,' Mr. Peggotty began, as 
              he raised his eyes to ours, 'to my lodging, wheer I have a long 
              time been expecting of her and preparing fur her. It was hours afore 
              she knowed me right; and when she did, she kneeled down at my feet, 
              and kiender said to me, as if it was her prayers, how it all come 
              to be. You may believe me, when I heerd her voice, as I had heerd 
              at home so playful - and see her humbled, as it might be in the 
              dust our Saviour wrote in with his blessed hand - I felt a wownd 
              go to my 'art, in the midst of all its thankfulness.' </p>
            <p>　　He drew his sleeve across his face, without any pretence of concealing 
              why; and then cleared his voice. </p>
            <p>　　'It warn't for long as I felt that; for she was found. I had 
              on'y to think as she was found, and it was gone. I doen't know why 
              I do so much as mention of it now, I'm sure. I didn't have it in 
              my mind a minute ago, to say a word about myself; but it come up 
              so nat'ral, that I yielded to it afore I was aweer.' </p>
            <p>　　'You are a self-denying soul,' said my aunt, 'and will have your 
              reward.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty, with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart 
              his face, made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt, 
              as an acknowledgement of her good opinion; then took up the thread 
              he had relinquished. </p>
            <p>　　'When my Em'ly took flight,' he said, in stern wrath for the 
              moment, 'from the house wheer she was made a prisoner by that theer 
              spotted snake as Mas'r Davy see, - and his story's trew, and may 
              GOD confound him! - she took flight in the night. It was a dark 
              night, with a many stars a-shining. She was wild. She ran along 
              the sea beach, believing the old boat was theer; and calling out 
              to us to turn away our faces, for she was a-coming by. She heerd 
              herself a-crying out, like as if it was another person; and cut 
              herself on them sharp-pinted stones and rocks, and felt it no more 
              than if she had been rock herself. Ever so fur she run, and there 
              was fire afore her eyes, and roarings in her ears. Of a sudden - 
              or so she thowt, you unnerstand - the day broke, wet and windy, 
              and she was lying b'low a heap of stone upon the shore, and a woman 
              was a-speaking to her, saying, in the language of that country, 
              what was it as had gone so much amiss?' </p>
            <p>　　He saw everything he related. It passed before him, as he spoke, 
              so vividly, that, in the intensity of his earnestness, he presented 
              what he described to me, with greater distinctness than I can express. 
              I can hardly believe, writing now long afterwards, but that I was 
              actually present in these scenes; they are impressed upon me with 
              such an astonishing air of fidelity. </p>
            <p>　　'As Em'ly's eyes - which was heavy - see this woman better,' 
              Mr. Peggotty went on, 'she know'd as she was one of them as she 
              had often talked to on the beach. Fur, though she had run (as I 
              have said) ever so fur in the night, she had oftentimes wandered 
              long ways, partly afoot, partly in boats and carriages, and know'd 
              all that country, 'long the coast, miles and miles. She hadn't no 
              children of her own, this woman, being a young wife; but she was 
              a- looking to have one afore long. And may my prayers go up to Heaven 
              that 'twill be a happiness to her, and a comfort, and a honour, 
              all her life! May it love her and be dootiful to her, in her old 
              age; helpful of her at the last; a Angel to her heer, and heerafter!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Amen!' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'She had been summat timorous and down,' said Mr. Peggotty, and 
              had sat, at first, a little way off, at her spinning, or such work 
              as it was, when Em'ly talked to the children. But Em'ly had took 
              notice of her, and had gone and spoke to her; and as the young woman 
              was partial to the children herself, they had soon made friends. 
              Sermuchser, that when Em'ly went that way, she always giv Em'ly 
              flowers. This was her as now asked what it was that had gone so 
              much amiss. Em'ly told her, and she - took her home. She did indeed. 
              She took her home,' said Mr. Peggotty, covering his face. </p>
            <p>　　He was more affected by this act of kindness, than I had ever 
              seen him affected by anything since the night she went away. My 
              aunt and I did not attempt to disturb him. </p>
            <p>　　'It was a little cottage, you may suppose,' he said, presently, 
              'but she found space for Em'ly in it, - her husband was away at 
              sea, - and she kep it secret, and prevailed upon such neighbours 
              as she had (they was not many near) to keep it secret too. Em'ly 
              was took bad with fever, and, what is very strange to me is, - maybe 
              'tis not so strange to scholars, - the language of that country 
              went out of her head, and she could only speak her own, that no 
              one unnerstood. She recollects, as if she had dreamed it, that she 
              lay there always a-talking her own tongue, always believing as the 
              old boat was round the next pint in the bay, and begging and imploring 
              of 'em to send theer and tell how she was dying, and bring back 
              a message of forgiveness, if it was on'y a wured. A'most the whole 
              time, she thowt, - now, that him as I made mention on just now was 
              lurking for her unnerneath the winder; now that him as had brought 
              her to this was in the room, - and cried to the good young woman 
              not to give her up, and know'd, at the same time, that she couldn't 
              unnerstand, and dreaded that she must be took away. Likewise the 
              fire was afore her eyes, and the roarings in her ears; and theer 
              was no today, nor yesterday, nor yet tomorrow; but everything in 
              her life as ever had been, or as ever could be, and everything as 
              never had been, and as never could be, was a crowding on her all 
              at once, and nothing clear nor welcome, and yet she sang and laughed 
              about it! How long this lasted, I doen't know; but then theer come 
              a sleep; and in that sleep, from being a many times stronger than 
              her own self, she fell into the weakness of the littlest child.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Here he stopped, as if for relief from the terrors of his own 
              description. After being silent for a few moments, he pursued his 
              story. </p>
            <p>　　'It was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke; and so quiet, that 
              there warn't a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a 
              tide, upon the shore. It was her belief, at first, that she was 
              at home upon a Sunday morning; but the vine leaves as she see at 
              the winder, and the hills beyond, warn't home, and contradicted 
              of her. Then, come in her friend to watch alongside of her bed; 
              and then she know'd as the old boat warn't round that next pint 
              in the bay no more, but was fur off; and know'd where she was, and 
              why; and broke out a-crying on that good young woman's bosom, wheer 
              I hope her baby is a-lying now, a-cheering of her with its pretty 
              eyes!' </p>
            <p>　　He could not speak of this good friend of Emily's without a flow 
              of tears. It was in vain to try. He broke down again, endeavouring 
              to bless her! </p>
            <p>　　'That done my Em'ly good,' he resumed, after such emotion as 
              I could not behold without sharing in; and as to my aunt, she wept 
              with all her heart; 'that done Em'ly good, and she begun to mend. 
              But, the language of that country was quite gone from her, and she 
              was forced to make signs. So she went on, getting better from day 
              to day, slow, but sure, and trying to learn the names of common 
              things - names as she seemed never to have heerd in all her life 
              - till one evening come, when she was a-setting at her window, looking 
              at a little girl at play upon the beach. And of a sudden this child 
              held out her hand, and said, what would be in English, &quot;Fisherman's 
              daughter, here's a shell!&quot; - for you are to unnerstand that 
              they used at first to call her &quot;Pretty lady&quot;, as the general 
              way in that country is, and that she had taught 'em to call her 
              &quot;Fisherman's daughter&quot; instead. The child says of a sudden, 
              &quot;Fisherman's daughter, here's a shell!&quot; Then Em'ly unnerstands 
              her; and she answers, bursting out a-crying; and it all comes back! 
            </p>
            <p>　　'When Em'ly got strong again,' said Mr. Peggotty, after another 
              short interval of silence, 'she cast about to leave that good young 
              creetur, and get to her own country. The husband was come home, 
              then; and the two together put her aboard a small trader bound to 
              Leghorn, and from that to France. She had a little money, but it 
              was less than little as they would take for all they done. I'm a'most 
              glad on it, though they was so poor! What they done, is laid up 
              wheer neither moth or rust doth corrupt, and wheer thieves do not 
              break through nor steal. Mas'r Davy, it'll outlast all the treasure 
              in the wureld. </p>
            <p>　　'Em'ly got to France, and took service to wait on travelling 
              ladies at a inn in the port. Theer, theer come, one day, that snake. 
              - Let him never come nigh me. I doen't know what hurt I might do 
              him! - Soon as she see him, without him seeing her, all her fear 
              and wildness returned upon her, and she fled afore the very breath 
              he draw'd. She come to England, and was set ashore at Dover. </p>
            <p>　　'I doen't know,&quot; said Mr. Peggotty, 'for sure, when her 
              'art begun to fail her; but all the way to England she had thowt 
              to come to her dear home. Soon as she got to England she turned 
              her face tow'rds it. But, fear of not being forgiv, fear of being 
              pinted at, fear of some of us being dead along of her, fear of many 
              things, turned her from it, kiender by force, upon the road: &quot;Uncle, 
              uncle,&quot; she says to me, &quot;the fear of not being worthy 
              to do what my torn and bleeding breast so longed to do, was the 
              most fright'ning fear of all! I turned back, when my 'art was full 
              of prayers that I might crawl to the old door-step, in the night, 
              kiss it, lay my wicked face upon it, and theer be found dead in 
              the morning.&quot; </p>
            <p>　　'She come,' said Mr. Peggotty, dropping his voice to an awe-stricken 
              whisper, 'to London. She - as had never seen it in her life - alone 
              - without a penny - young - so pretty - come to London. A'most the 
              moment as she lighted heer, all so desolate, she found (as she believed) 
              a friend; a decent woman as spoke to her about the needle-work as 
              she had been brought up to do, about finding plenty of it fur her, 
              about a lodging fur the night, and making secret inquiration concerning 
              of me and all at home, tomorrow. When my child,' he said aloud, 
              and with an energy of gratitude that shook him from head to foot, 
              'stood upon the brink of more than I can say or think on - Martha, 
              trew to her promise, saved her.' </p>
            <p>　　I could not repress a cry of joy. </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy!' said he, gripping my hand in that strong hand of 
              his, 'it was you as first made mention of her to me. I thankee, 
              sir! She was arnest. She had know'd of her bitter knowledge wheer 
              to watch and what to do. She had done it. And the Lord was above 
              all! She come, white and hurried, upon Em'ly in her sleep. She says 
              to her, &quot;Rise up from worse than death, and come with me!&quot; 
              Them belonging to the house would have stopped her, but they might 
              as soon have stopped the sea. &quot;Stand away from me,&quot; she 
              says, &quot;I am a ghost that calls her from beside her open grave!&quot; 
              She told Em'ly she had seen me, and know'd I loved her, and forgive 
              her. She wrapped her, hasty, in her clothes. She took her, faint 
              and trembling, on her arm. She heeded no more what they said, than 
              if she had had no ears. She walked among 'em with my child, minding 
              only her; and brought her safe out, in the dead of the night, from 
              that black pit of ruin! </p>
            <p>　　'She attended on Em'ly,' said Mr. Peggotty, who had released 
              my hand, and put his own hand on his heaving chest; 'she attended 
              to my Em'ly, lying wearied out, and wandering betwixt whiles, till 
              late next day. Then she went in search of me; then in search of 
              you, Mas'r Davy. She didn't tell Em'ly what she come out fur, lest 
              her 'art should fail, and she should think of hiding of herself. 
              How the cruel lady know'd of her being theer, I can't say. Whether 
              him as I have spoke so much of, chanced to see 'em going theer, 
              or whether (which is most like, to my thinking) he had heerd it 
              from the woman, I doen't greatly ask myself. My niece is found. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'All night long,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'we have been together, 
              Em'ly and me. 'Tis little (considering the time) as she has said, 
              in wureds, through them broken-hearted tears; 'tis less as I have 
              seen of her dear face, as grow'd into a woman's at my hearth. But, 
              all night long, her arms has been about my neck; and her head has 
              laid heer; and we knows full well, as we can put our trust in one 
              another, ever more.' </p>
            <p>　　He ceased to speak, and his hand upon the table rested there 
              in perfect repose, with a resolution in it that might have conquered 
              lions. </p>
            <p>　　'It was a gleam of light upon me, Trot,' said my aunt, drying 
              her eyes, 'when I formed the resolution of being godmother to your 
              sister Betsey Trotwood, who disappointed me; but, next to that, 
              hardly anything would have given me greater pleasure, than to be 
              godmother to that good young creature's baby!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunt's feelings, 
              but could not trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject 
              of her commendation. We all remained silent, and occupied with our 
              own reflections (my aunt drying her eyes, and now sobbing convulsively, 
              and now laughing and calling herself a fool); until I spoke. </p>
            <p>　　'You have quite made up your mind,' said I to Mr. Peggotty, 'as 
              to the future, good friend? I need scarcely ask you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Quite, Mas'r Davy,' he returned; 'and told Em'ly. Theer's mighty 
              countries, fur from heer. Our future life lays over the sea.' </p>
            <p>　　'They will emigrate together, aunt,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes!' said Mr. Peggotty, with a hopeful smile. 'No one can't 
              reproach my darling in Australia. We will begin a new life over 
              theer!' </p>
            <p>　　I asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going 
              away. </p>
            <p>　　'I was down at the Docks early this morning, sir,' he returned, 
              'to get information concerning of them ships. In about six weeks 
              or two months from now, there'll be one sailing - I see her this 
              morning - went aboard - and we shall take our passage in her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Quite alone?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Aye, Mas'r Davy!' he returned. 'My sister, you see, she's that 
              fond of you and yourn, and that accustomed to think on'y of her 
              own country, that it wouldn't be hardly fair to let her go. Besides 
              which, theer's one she has in charge, Mas'r Davy, as doen't ought 
              to be forgot.' </p>
            <p>　　'Poor Ham!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'My good sister takes care of his house, you see, ma'am, and 
              he takes kindly to her,' Mr. Peggotty explained for my aunt's better 
              information. 'He'll set and talk to her, with a calm spirit, wen 
              it's like he couldn't bring himself to open his lips to another. 
              Poor fellow!' said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, 'theer's not 
              so much left him, that he could spare the little as he has!' </p>
            <p>　　'And Mrs. Gummidge?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, I've had a mort of consideration, I do tell you,' returned 
              Mr. Peggotty, with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he 
              went on, 'concerning of Missis Gummidge. You see, wen Missis Gummidge 
              falls a-thinking of the old 'un, she an't what you may call good 
              company. Betwixt you and me, Mas'r Davy - and you, ma'am - wen Mrs. 
              Gummidge takes to wimicking,' - our old country word for crying, 
              - 'she's liable to be considered to be, by them as didn't know the 
              old 'un, peevish-like. Now I DID know the old 'un,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              'and I know'd his merits, so I unnerstan' her; but 'tan't entirely 
              so, you see, with others - nat'rally can't be!' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt and I both acquiesced. </p>
            <p>　　'Wheerby,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'my sister might - I doen't say 
              she would, but might - find Missis Gummidge give her a leetle trouble 
              now-and-again. Theerfur 'tan't my intentions to moor Missis Gummidge 
              'long with them, but to find a Beein' fur her wheer she can fisherate 
              for herself.' (A Beein' signifies, in that dialect, a home, and 
              to fisherate is to provide.) 'Fur which purpose,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              'I means to make her a 'lowance afore I go, as'll leave her pretty 
              comfort'ble. She's the faithfullest of creeturs. 'Tan't to be expected, 
              of course, at her time of life, and being lone and lorn, as the 
              good old Mawther is to be knocked about aboardship, and in the woods 
              and wilds of a new and fur-away country. So that's what I'm a-going 
              to do with her.' </p>
            <p>　　He forgot nobody. He thought of everybody's claims and strivings, 
              but his own. </p>
            <p>　　'Em'ly,' he continued, 'will keep along with me - poor child, 
              she's sore in need of peace and rest! - until such time as we goes 
              upon our voyage. She'll work at them clothes, as must be made; and 
              I hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was, 
              wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt nodded confirmation of this hope, and imparted great 
              satisfaction to Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Theer's one thing furder, Mas'r Davy,' said he, putting his 
              hand in his breast-pocket, and gravely taking out the little paper 
              bundle I had seen before, which he unrolled on the table. 'Theer's 
              these here banknotes - fifty pound, and ten. To them I wish to add 
              the money as she come away with. I've asked her about that (but 
              not saying why), and have added of it up. I an't a scholar. Would 
              you be so kind as see how 'tis?' </p>
            <p>　　He handed me, apologetically for his scholarship, a piece of 
              paper, and observed me while I looked it over. It was quite right. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Thankee, sir,' he said, taking it back. 'This money, if you 
              doen't see objections, Mas'r Davy, I shall put up jest afore I go, 
              in a cover directed to him; and put that up in another, directed 
              to his mother. I shall tell her, in no more wureds than I speak 
              to you, what it's the price on; and that I'm gone, and past receiving 
              of it back.' </p>
            <p>　　I told him that I thought it would be right to do so - that I 
              was thoroughly convinced it would be, since he felt it to be right. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I said that theer was on'y one thing furder,' he proceeded with 
              a grave smile, when he had made up his little bundle again, and 
              put it in his pocket; 'but theer was two. I warn't sure in my mind, 
              wen I come out this morning, as I could go and break to Ham, of 
              my own self, what had so thankfully happened. So I writ a letter 
              while I was out, and put it in the post-office, telling of 'em how 
              all was as 'tis; and that I should come down tomorrow to unload 
              my mind of what little needs a-doing of down theer, and, most-like, 
              take my farewell leave of Yarmouth.' </p>
            <p>　　'And do you wish me to go with you?' said I, seeing that he left 
              something unsaid. </p>
            <p>　　'If you could do me that kind favour, Mas'r Davy,' he replied. 
              'I know the sight on you would cheer 'em up a bit.' </p>
            <p>　　My little Dora being in good spirits, and very desirous that 
              I should go - as I found on talking it over with her - I readily 
              pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish. Next 
              morning, consequently, we were on the Yarmouth coach, and again 
              travelling over the old ground. </p>
            <p>　　As we passed along the familiar street at night - Mr. Peggotty, 
              in despite of all my remonstrances, carrying my bag - I glanced 
              into Omer and Joram's shop, and saw my old friend Mr. Omer there, 
              smoking his pipe. I felt reluctant to be present, when Mr. Peggotty 
              first met his sister and Ham; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering 
              behind. </p>
            <p>　　'How is Mr. Omer, after this long time?' said I, going in. </p>
            <p>　　He fanned away the smoke of his pipe, that he might get a better 
              view of me, and soon recognized me with great delight. </p>
            <p>　　'I should get up, sir, to acknowledge such an honour as this 
              visit,' said he, 'only my limbs are rather out of sorts, and I am 
              wheeled about. With the exception of my limbs and my breath, howsoever, 
              I am as hearty as a man can be, I'm thankful to say.' </p>
            <p>　　I congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits, 
              and saw, now, that his easy-chair went on wheels. </p>
            <p>　　'It's an ingenious thing, ain't it?' he inquired, following the 
              direction of my glance, and polishing the elbow with his arm. 'It 
              runs as light as a feather, and tracks as true as a mail-coach. 
              Bless you, my little Minnie - my grand-daughter you know, Minnie's 
              child - puts her little strength against the back, gives it a shove, 
              and away we go, as clever and merry as ever you see anything! And 
              I tell you what - it's a most uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing, 
              and find out the enjoyment of it, as Mr. Omer. He was as radiant, 
              as if his chair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were 
              the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury 
              of a pipe. </p>
            <p>　　'I see more of the world, I can assure you,' said Mr. Omer, 'in 
              this chair, than ever I see out of it. You'd be surprised at the 
              number of people that looks in of a day to have a chat. You really 
              would! There's twice as much in the newspaper, since I've taken 
              to this chair, as there used to be. As to general reading, dear 
              me, what a lot of it I do get through! That's what I feel so strong, 
              you know! If it had been my eyes, what should I have done? If it 
              had been my ears, what should I have done? Being my limbs, what 
              does it signify? Why, my limbs only made my breath shorter when 
              I used 'em. And now, if I want to go out into the street or down 
              to the sands, I've only got to call Dick, Joram's youngest 'prentice, 
              and away I go in my own carriage, like the Lord Mayor of London.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He half suffocated himself with laughing here. </p>
            <p>　　'Lord bless you!' said Mr. Omer, resuming his pipe, 'a man must 
              take the fat with the lean; that's what he must make up his mind 
              to, in this life. Joram does a fine business. Ex-cellent business!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am very glad to hear it,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I knew you would be,' said Mr. Omer. 'And Joram and Minnie are 
              like Valentines. What more can a man expect? What's his limbs to 
              that!' </p>
            <p>　　His supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was 
              one of the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered. </p>
            <p>　　'And since I've took to general reading, you've took to general 
              writing, eh, sir?' said Mr. Omer, surveying me admiringly. 'What 
              a lovely work that was of yours! What expressions in it! I read 
              it every word - every word. And as to feeling sleepy! Not at all!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I laughingly expressed my satisfaction, but I must confess that 
              I thought this association of ideas significant. </p>
            <p>　　'I give you my word and honour, sir,' said Mr. Omer, 'that when 
              I lay that book upon the table, and look at it outside; compact 
              in three separate and indiwidual wollumes - one, two, three; I am 
              as proud as Punch to think that I once had the honour of being connected 
              with your family. And dear me, it's a long time ago, now, ain't 
              it? Over at Blunderstone. With a pretty little party laid along 
              with the other party. And you quite a small party then, yourself. 
              Dear, dear!' </p>
            <p>　　I changed the subject by referring to Emily. After assuring him 
              that I did not forget how interested he had always been in her, 
              and how kindly he had always treated her, I gave him a general account 
              of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha; which I knew 
              would please the old man. He listened with the utmost attention, 
              and said, feelingly, when I had done: </p>
            <p>　　'I am rejoiced at it, sir! It's the best news I have heard for 
              many a day. Dear, dear, dear! And what's going to be undertook for 
              that unfortunate young woman, Martha, now?' </p>
            <p>　　'You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since 
              yesterday,' said I, 'but on which I can give you no information 
              yet, Mr. Omer. Mr. Peggotty has not alluded to it, and I have a 
              delicacy in doing so. I am sure he has not forgotten it. He forgets 
              nothing that is disinterested and good.' </p>
            <p>　　'Because you know,' said Mr. Omer, taking himself up, where he 
              had left off, 'whatever is done, I should wish to be a member of. 
              Put me down for anything you may consider right, and let me know. 
              I never could think the girl all bad, and I am glad to find she's 
              not. So will my daughter Minnie be. Young women are contradictory 
              creatures in some things - her mother was just the same as her - 
              but their hearts are soft and kind. It's all show with Minnie, about 
              Martha. Why she should consider it necessary to make any show, I 
              don't undertake to tell you. But it's all show, bless you. She'd 
              do her any kindness in private. So, put me down for whatever you 
              may consider right, will you be so good? and drop me a line where 
              to forward it. Dear me!' said Mr. Omer, 'when a man is drawing on 
              to a time of life, where the two ends of life meet; when he finds 
              himself, however hearty he is, being wheeled about for the second 
              time, in a speeches of go-cart; he should be over-rejoiced to do 
              a kindness if he can. He wants plenty. And I don't speak of myself, 
              particular,' said Mr. Omer, 'because, sir, the way I look at it 
              is, that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill, whatever 
              age we are, on account of time never standing still for a single 
              moment. So let us always do a kindness, and be over-rejoiced. To 
              be sure!' </p>
            <p>　　He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put it on a ledge in 
              the back of his chair, expressly made for its reception. </p>
            <p>　　'There's Em'ly's cousin, him that she was to have been married 
              to,' said Mr. Omer, rubbing his hands feebly, 'as fine a fellow 
              as there is in Yarmouth! He'll come and talk or read to me, in the 
              evening, for an hour together sometimes. That's a kindness, I should 
              call it! All his life's a kindness.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am going to see him now,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Are you?' said Mr. Omer. 'Tell him I was hearty, and sent my 
              respects. Minnie and Joram's at a ball. They would be as proud to 
              see you as I am, if they was at home. Minnie won't hardly go out 
              at all, you see, &quot;on account of father&quot;, as she says. 
              So I swore tonight, that if she didn't go, I'd go to bed at six. 
              In consequence of which,' Mr. Omer shook himself and his chair with 
              laughter at the success of his device, 'she and Joram's at a ball.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I shook hands with him, and wished him good night. </p>
            <p>　　'Half a minute, sir,' said Mr. Omer. 'If you was to go without 
              seeing my little elephant, you'd lose the best of sights. You never 
              see such a sight! Minnie!' A musical little voice answered, from 
              somewhere upstairs, 'I am coming, grandfather!' and a pretty little 
              girl with long, flaxen, curling hair, soon came running into the 
              shop. </p>
            <p>　　'This is my little elephant, sir,' said Mr. Omer, fondling the 
              child. 'Siamese breed, sir. Now, little elephant!' </p>
            <p>　　The little elephant set the door of the parlour open, enabling 
              me to see that, in these latter days, it was converted into a bedroom 
              for Mr. Omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs; and then 
              hid her pretty forehead, and tumbled her long hair, against the 
              back of Mr. Omer's chair. </p>
            <p>　　'The elephant butts, you know, sir,' said Mr. Omer, winking, 
              'when he goes at a object. Once, elephant. Twice. Three times!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　At this signal, the little elephant, with a dexterity that was 
              next to marvellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round 
              with Mr. Omer in it, and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlour, 
              without touching the door-post: Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying 
              the performance, and looking back at me on the road as if it were 
              the triumphant issue of his life's exertions. </p>
            <p>　　After a stroll about the town I went to Ham's house. Peggotty 
              had now removed here for good; and had let her own house to the 
              successor of Mr. Barkis in the carrying business, who had paid her 
              very well for the good-will, cart, and horse. I believe the very 
              same slow horse that Mr. Barkis drove was still at work. </p>
            <p>　　I found them in the neat kitchen, accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge, 
              who had been fetched from the old boat by Mr. Peggotty himself. 
              I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post, by anyone 
              else. He had evidently told them all. Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge 
              had their aprons to their eyes, and Ham had just stepped out 'to 
              take a turn on the beach'. He presently came home, very glad to 
              see me; and I hope they were all the better for my being there. 
              We spoke, with some approach to cheerfulness, of Mr. Peggotty's 
              growing rich in a new country, and of the wonders he would describe 
              in his letters. We said nothing of Emily by name, but distantly 
              referred to her more than once. Ham was the serenest of the party. 
            </p>
            <p>　　But, Peggotty told me, when she lighted me to a little chamber 
              where the Crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table, that 
              he always was the same. She believed (she told me, crying) that 
              he was broken-hearted; though he was as full of courage as of sweetness, 
              and worked harder and better than any boat-builder in any yard in 
              all that part. There were times, she said, of an evening, when he 
              talked of their old life in the boat-house; and then he mentioned 
              Emily as a child. But, he never mentioned her as a woman. </p>
            <p>　　I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak 
              to me alone. I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next 
              evening, as he came home from his work. Having settled this with 
              myself, I fell asleep. That night, for the first time in all those 
              many nights, the candle was taken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty 
              swung in his old hammock in the old boat, and the wind murmured 
              with the old sound round his head. </p>
            <p>　　All next day, he was occupied in disposing of his fishing-boat 
              and tackle; in packing up, and sending to London by waggon, such 
              of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful 
              to him; and in parting with the rest, or bestowing them on Mrs. 
              Gummidge. She was with him all day. As I had a sorrowful wish to 
              see the old place once more, before it was locked up, I engaged 
              to meet them there in the evening. But I so arranged it, as that 
              I should meet Ham first. </p>
            <p>　　It was easy to come in his way, as I knew where he worked. I 
              met him at a retired part of the sands, which I knew he would cross, 
              and turned back with him, that he might have leisure to speak to 
              me if he really wished. I had not mistaken the expression of his 
              face. We had walked but a little way together, when he said, without 
              looking at me: </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy, have you seen her?' </p>
            <p>　　'Only for a moment, when she was in a swoon,' I softly answered. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We walked a little farther, and he said: </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy, shall you see her, d'ye think?' </p>
            <p>　　'It would be too painful to her, perhaps,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I have thowt of that,' he replied. 'So 'twould, sir, so 'twould.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'But, Ham,' said I, gently, 'if there is anything that I could 
              write to her, for you, in case I could not tell it; if there is 
              anything you would wish to make known to her through me; I should 
              consider it a sacred trust.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure on't. I thankee, sir, most kind! I think theer is 
              something I could wish said or wrote.' </p>
            <p>　　'What is it?' </p>
            <p>　　We walked a little farther in silence, and then he spoke. </p>
            <p>　　''Tan't that I forgive her. 'Tan't that so much. 'Tis more as 
              I beg of her to forgive me, for having pressed my affections upon 
              her. Odd times, I think that if I hadn't had her promise fur to 
              marry me, sir, she was that trustful of me, in a friendly way, that 
              she'd have told me what was struggling in her mind, and would have 
              counselled with me, and I might have saved her.' </p>
            <p>　　I pressed his hand. 'Is that all?' 'Theer's yet a something else,' 
              he returned, 'if I can say it, Mas'r Davy.' </p>
            <p>　　We walked on, farther than we had walked yet, before he spoke 
              again. He was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express 
              by lines. He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I loved her - and I love the mem'ry of her - too deep - to be 
              able to lead her to believe of my own self as I'm a happy man. I 
              could only be happy - by forgetting of her - and I'm afeerd I couldn't 
              hardly bear as she should be told I done that. But if you, being 
              so full of learning, Mas'r Davy, could think of anything to say 
              as might bring her to believe I wasn't greatly hurt: still loving 
              of her, and mourning for her: anything as might bring her to believe 
              as I was not tired of my life, and yet was hoping fur to see her 
              without blame, wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary 
              are at rest - anything as would ease her sorrowful mind, and yet 
              not make her think as I could ever marry, or as 'twas possible that 
              anyone could ever be to me what she was - I should ask of you to 
              say that - with my prayers for her - that was so dear.' </p>
            <p>　　I pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself 
              to do this as well as I could. </p>
            <p>　　'I thankee, sir,' he answered. ''Twas kind of you to meet me. 
              'Twas kind of you to bear him company down. Mas'r Davy, I unnerstan' 
              very well, though my aunt will come to Lon'on afore they sail, and 
              they'll unite once more, that I am not like to see him agen. I fare 
              to feel sure on't. We doen't say so, but so 'twill be, and better 
              so. The last you see on him - the very last - will you give him 
              the lovingest duty and thanks of the orphan, as he was ever more 
              than a father to?' </p>
            <p>　　This I also promised, faithfully. </p>
            <p>　　'I thankee agen, sir,' he said, heartily shaking hands. 'I know 
              wheer you're a-going. Good-bye!' </p>
            <p>　　With a slight wave of his hand, as though to explain to me that 
              he could not enter the old place, he turned away. As I looked after 
              his figure, crossing the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn 
              his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass 
              on, looking at it, until he was a shadow in the distance. </p>
            <p>　　The door of the boat-house stood open when I approached; and, 
              on entering, I found it emptied of all its furniture, saving one 
              of the old lockers, on which Mrs. Gummidge, with a basket on her 
              knee, was seated, looking at Mr. Peggotty. He leaned his elbow on 
              the rough chimney-piece, and gazed upon a few expiring embers in 
              the grate; but he raised his head, hopefully, on my coming in, and 
              spoke in a cheery manner. </p>
            <p>　　'Come, according to promise, to bid farewell to 't, eh, Mas'r 
              Davy?' he said, taking up the candle. 'Bare enough, now, an't it?' 
              'Indeed you have made good use of the time,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, we have not been idle, sir. Missis Gummidge has worked 
              like a - I doen't know what Missis Gummidge an't worked like,' said 
              Mr. Peggotty, looking at her, at a loss for a sufficiently approving 
              simile. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Gummidge, leaning on her basket, made no observation. </p>
            <p>　　'Theer's the very locker that you used to sit on, 'long with 
              Em'ly!' said Mr. Peggotty, in a whisper. 'I'm a-going to carry it 
              away with me, last of all. And heer's your old little bedroom, see, 
              Mas'r Davy! A'most as bleak tonight, as 'art could wish!' </p>
            <p>　　In truth, the wind, though it was low, had a solemn sound, and 
              crept around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was 
              very mournful. Everything was gone, down to the little mirror with 
              the oyster-shell frame. I thought of myself, lying here, when that 
              first great change was being wrought at home. I thought of the blue-eyed 
              child who had enchanted me. I thought of Steerforth: and a foolish, 
              fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand, and liable 
              to be met at any turn. </p>
            <p>　　''Tis like to be long,' said Mr. Peggotty, in a low voice, 'afore 
              the boat finds new tenants. They look upon 't, down beer, as being 
              unfortunate now!' </p>
            <p>　　'Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'To a mast-maker up town,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'I'm a-going to 
              give the key to him tonight.' </p>
            <p>　　We looked into the other little room, and came back to Mrs. Gummidge, 
              sitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the 
              chimney-piece, requested to rise, that he might carry it outside 
              the door before extinguishing the candle. </p>
            <p>　　'Dan'l,' said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, and 
              clinging to his arm 'my dear Dan'l, the parting words I speak in 
              this house is, I mustn't be left behind. Doen't ye think of leaving 
              me behind, Dan'l! Oh, doen't ye ever do it!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty, taken aback, looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me, and 
              from me to Mrs. Gummidge, as if he had been awakened from a sleep. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Doen't ye, dearest Dan'l, doen't ye!' cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently. 
              'Take me 'long with you, Dan'l, take me 'long with you and Em'ly! 
              I'll be your servant, constant and trew. If there's slaves in them 
              parts where you're a-going, I'll be bound to you for one, and happy, 
              but doen't ye leave me behind, Dan'l, that's a deary dear!' </p>
            <p>　　'My good soul,' said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, 'you doen't 
              know what a long voyage, and what a hard life 'tis!' 'Yes, I do, 
              Dan'l! I can guess!' cried Mrs. Gummidge. 'But my parting words 
              under this roof is, I shall go into the house and die, if I am not 
              took. I can dig, Dan'l. I can work. I can live hard. I can be loving 
              and patient now - more than you think, Dan'l, if you'll on'y try 
              me. I wouldn't touch the 'lowance, not if I was dying of want, Dan'l 
              Peggotty; but I'll go with you and Em'ly, if you'll on'y let me, 
              to the world's end! I know how 'tis; I know you think that I am 
              lone and lorn; but, deary love, 'tan't so no more! I ain't sat here, 
              so long, a-watching, and a-thinking of your trials, without some 
              good being done me. Mas'r Davy, speak to him for me! I knows his 
              ways, and Em'ly's, and I knows their sorrows, and can be a comfort 
              to 'em, some odd times, and labour for 'em allus! Dan'l, deary Dan'l, 
              let me go 'long with you!' </p>
            <p>　　And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, and kissed it with a homely 
              pathos and affection, in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude, 
              that he well deserved. </p>
            <p>　　We brought the locker out, extinguished the candle, fastened 
              the door on the outside, and left the old boat close shut up, a 
              dark speck in the cloudy night. Next day, when we were returning 
              to London outside the coach, Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on 
              the seat behind, and Mrs. Gummidge was happy. </p>

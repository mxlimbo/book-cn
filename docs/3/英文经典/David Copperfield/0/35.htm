            <p>　　 I wrote to Agnes as soon as Dora and I were engaged. I wrote 
              her a long letter, in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest 
              I was, and what a darling Dora was. I entreated Agnes not to regard 
              this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other, 
              or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used 
              to joke about. I assured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable, 
              and expressed my belief that nothing like it had ever been known. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Somehow, as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window, 
              and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came 
              stealing over me, it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry 
              and agitation in which I had been living lately, and of which my 
              very happiness partook in some degree, that it soothed me into tears. 
              I remember that I sat resting my head upon my hand, when the letter 
              was half done, cherishing a general fancy as if Agnes were one of 
              the elements of my natural home. As if, in the retirement of the 
              house made almost sacred to me by her presence, Dora and I must 
              be happier than anywhere. As if, in love, joy, sorrow, hope, or 
              disappointment; in all emotions; my heart turned naturally there, 
              and found its refuge and best friend. </p>
            <p>　　Of Steerforth I said nothing. I only told her there had been 
              sad grief at Yarmouth, on account of Emily's flight; and that on 
              me it made a double wound, by reason of the circumstances attending 
              it. I knew how quick she always was to divine the truth, and that 
              she would never be the first to breathe his name. To this letter, 
              I received an answer by return of post. As I read it, I seemed to 
              hear Agnes speaking to me. It was like her cordial voice in my ears. 
              What can I say more! </p>
            <p>　　While I had been away from home lately, Traddles had called twice 
              or thrice. Finding Peggotty within, and being informed by Peggotty 
              (who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive 
              it), that she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured 
              acquaintance with her, and had stayed to have a little chat with 
              her about me. So Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all 
              on her own side, and of immoderate length, as she was very difficult 
              indeed to stop, God bless her! when she had me for her theme. </p>
            <p>　　This reminds me, not only that I expected Traddles on a certain 
              afternoon of his own appointing, which was now come, but that Mrs. 
              Crupp had resigned everything appertaining to her office (the salary 
              excepted) until Peggotty should cease to present herself. Mrs. Crupp, 
              after holding divers conversations respecting Peggotty, in a very 
              high-pitched voice, on the staircase - with some invisible Familiar 
              it would appear, for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at 
              those times - addressed a letter to me, developing her views. Beginning 
              it with that statement of universal application, which fitted every 
              occurrence of her life, namely, that she was a mother herself, she 
              went on to inform me that she had once seen very different days, 
              but that at all periods of her existence she had had a constitutional 
              objection to spies, intruders, and informers. She named no names, 
              she said; let them the cap fitted, wear it; but spies, intruders, 
              and informers, especially in widders' weeds (this clause was underlined), 
              she had ever accustomed herself to look down upon. If a gentleman 
              was the victim of spies, intruders, and informers (but still naming 
              no names), that was his own pleasure. He had a right to please himself; 
              so let him do. All that she, Mrs. Crupp, stipulated for, was, that 
              she should not be 'brought in contract' with such persons. Therefore 
              she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top 
              set, until things were as they formerly was, and as they could be 
              wished to be; and further mentioned that her little book would be 
              found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning, when she 
              requested an immediate settlement of the same, with the benevolent 
              view of saving trouble 'and an ill-conwenience' to all parties. 
            </p>
            <p>　　After this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on 
              the stairs, principally with pitchers, and endeavouring to delude 
              Peggotty into breaking her legs. I found it rather harassing to 
              live in this state of siege, but was too much afraid of Mrs. Crupp 
              to see any way out of it. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' cried Traddles, punctually appearing at 
              my door, in spite of all these obstacles, 'how do you do?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Traddles,' said I, 'I am delighted to see you at last, 
              and very sorry I have not been at home before. But I have been so 
              much engaged -' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, yes, I know,' said Traddles, 'of course. Yours lives in 
              London, I think.' </p>
            <p>　　'What did you say?' </p>
            <p>　　'She - excuse me - Miss D., you know,' said Traddles, colouring 
              in his great delicacy, 'lives in London, I believe?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh yes. Near London.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mine, perhaps you recollect,' said Traddles, with a serious 
              look, 'lives down in Devonshire - one of ten. Consequently, I am 
              not so much engaged as you - in that sense.' 'I wonder you can bear,' 
              I returned, 'to see her so seldom.' </p>
            <p>　　'Hah!' said Traddles, thoughtfully. 'It does seem a wonder. I 
              suppose it is, Copperfield, because there is no help for it?' </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose so,' I replied with a smile, and not without a blush. 
              'And because you have so much constancy and patience, Traddles.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' said Traddles, considering about it, 'do I strike 
              you in that way, Copperfield? Really I didn't know that I had. But 
              she is such an extraordinarily dear girl herself, that it's possible 
              she may have imparted something of those virtues to me. Now you 
              mention it, Copperfield, I shouldn't wonder at all. I assure you 
              she is always forgetting herself, and taking care of the other nine.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Is she the eldest?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear, no,' said Traddles. 'The eldest is a Beauty.' </p>
            <p>　　He saw, I suppose, that I could not help smiling at the simplicity 
              of this reply; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not, of course, but that my Sophy - pretty name, Copperfield, 
              I always think?' </p>
            <p>　　'Very pretty!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Not, of course, but that Sophy is beautiful too in my eyes, 
              and would be one of the dearest girls that ever was, in anybody's 
              eyes (I should think). But when I say the eldest is a Beauty, I 
              mean she really is a -' he seemed to be describing clouds about 
              himself, with both hands: 'Splendid, you know,' said Traddles, energetically. 
              'Indeed!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, I assure you,' said Traddles, 'something very uncommon, 
              indeed! Then, you know, being formed for society and admiration, 
              and not being able to enjoy much of it in consequence of their limited 
              means, she naturally gets a little irritable and exacting, sometimes. 
              Sophy puts her in good humour!' </p>
            <p>　　'Is Sophy the youngest?' I hazarded. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear, no!' said Traddles, stroking his chin. 'The two youngest 
              are only nine and ten. Sophy educates 'em.' </p>
            <p>　　'The second daughter, perhaps?' I hazarded. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said Traddles. 'Sarah's the second. Sarah has something 
              the matter with her spine, poor girl. The malady will wear out by 
              and by, the doctors say, but in the meantime she has to lie down 
              for a twelvemonth. Sophy nurses her. Sophy's the fourth.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is the mother living?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh yes,' said Traddles, 'she is alive. She is a very superior 
              woman indeed, but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution, 
              and - in fact, she has lost the use of her limbs.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Very sad, is it not?' returned Traddles. 'But in a merely domestic 
              view it is not so bad as it might be, because Sophy takes her place. 
              She is quite as much a mother to her mother, as she is to the other 
              nine.' </p>
            <p>　　I felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young 
              lady; and, honestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the 
              good-nature of Traddles from being imposed upon, to the detriment 
              of their joint prospects in life, inquired how Mr. Micawber was? 
            </p>
            <p>　　'He is quite well, Copperfield, thank you,' said Traddles. 'I 
              am not living with him at present.' </p>
            <p>　　'No?' </p>
            <p>　　'No. You see the truth is,' said Traddles, in a whisper, 'he 
              had changed his name to Mortimer, in consequence of his temporary 
              embarrassments; and he don't come out till after dark - and then 
              in spectacles. There was an execution put into our house, for rent. 
              Mrs. Micawber was in such a dreadful state that I really couldn't 
              resist giving my name to that second bill we spoke of here. You 
              may imagine how delightful it was to my feelings, Copperfield, to 
              see the matter settled with it, and Mrs. Micawber recover her spirits.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Hum!' said I. 'Not that her happiness was of long duration,' 
              pursued Traddles, 'for, unfortunately, within a week another execution 
              came in. It broke up the establishment. I have been living in a 
              furnished apartment since then, and the Mortimers have been very 
              private indeed. I hope you won't think it selfish, Copperfield, 
              if I mention that the broker carried off my little round table with 
              the marble top, and Sophy's flower-pot and stand?' </p>
            <p>　　'What a hard thing!' I exclaimed indignantly. </p>
            <p>　　'It was a - it was a pull,' said Traddles, with his usual wince 
              at that expression. 'I don't mention it reproachfully, however, 
              but with a motive. The fact is, Copperfield, I was unable to repurchase 
              them at the time of their seizure; in the first place, because the 
              broker, having an idea that I wanted them, ran the price up to an 
              extravagant extent; and, in the second place, because I - hadn't 
              any money. Now, I have kept my eye since, upon the broker's shop,' 
              said Traddles, with a great enjoyment of his mystery, 'which is 
              up at the top of Tottenham Court Road, and, at last, today I find 
              them put out for sale. I have only noticed them from over the way, 
              because if the broker saw me, bless you, he'd ask any price for 
              them! What has occurred to me, having now the money, is, that perhaps 
              you wouldn't object to ask that good nurse of yours to come with 
              me to the shop - I can show it her from round the corner of the 
              next street - and make the best bargain for them, as if they were 
              for herself, that she can!' </p>
            <p>　　The delight with which Traddles propounded this plan to me, and 
              the sense he had of its uncommon artfulness, are among the freshest 
              things in my remembrance. </p>
            <p>　　I told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him, 
              and that we would all three take the field together, but on one 
              condition. That condition was, that he should make a solemn resolution 
              to grant no more loans of his name, or anything else, to Mr. Micawber. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, 'I have already done so, 
              because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate, 
              but that I have been positively unjust to Sophy. My word being passed 
              to myself, there is no longer any apprehension; but I pledge it 
              to you, too, with the greatest readiness. That first unlucky obligation, 
              I have paid. I have no doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if 
              he could, but he could not. One thing I ought to mention, which 
              I like very much in Mr. Micawber, Copperfield. It refers to the 
              second obligation, which is not yet due. He don't tell me that it 
              is provided for, but he says it WILL BE. Now, I think there is something 
              very fair and honest about that!' </p>
            <p>　　I was unwilling to damp my good friend's confidence, and therefore 
              assented. After a little further conversation, we went round to 
              the chandler's shop, to enlist Peggotty; Traddles declining to pass 
              the evening with me, both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions 
              that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could 
              re-purchase it, and because it was the evening he always devoted 
              to writing to the dearest girl in the world. </p>
            <p>　　I never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street 
              in Tottenham Court Road, while Peggotty was bargaining for the precious 
              articles; or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after 
              vainly offering a price, and was hailed by the relenting broker, 
              and went back again. The end of the negotiation was, that she bought 
              the property on tolerably easy terms, and Traddles was transported 
              with pleasure. </p>
            <p>　　'I am very much obliged to you, indeed,' said Traddles, on hearing 
              it was to be sent to where he lived, that night. 'If I might ask 
              one other favour, I hope you would not think it absurd, Copperfield?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I said beforehand, certainly not. </p>
            <p>　　'Then if you WOULD be good enough,' said Traddles to Peggotty, 
              'to get the flower-pot now, I think I should like (it being Sophy's, 
              Copperfield) to carry it home myself!' </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty was glad to get it for him, and he overwhelmed her with 
              thanks, and went his way up Tottenham Court Road, carrying the flower-pot 
              affectionately in his arms, with one of the most delighted expressions 
              of countenance I ever saw. </p>
            <p>　　We then turned back towards my chambers. As the shops had charms 
              for Peggotty which I never knew them possess in the same degree 
              for anybody else, I sauntered easily along, amused by her staring 
              in at the windows, and waiting for her as often as she chose. We 
              were thus a good while in getting to the Adelphi. </p>
            <p>　　On our way upstairs, I called her attention to the sudden disappearance 
              of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps. 
              We were both very much surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer 
              door standing open (which I had shut) and to hear voices inside. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We looked at one another, without knowing what to make of this, 
              and went into the sitting-room. What was my amazement to find, of 
              all people upon earth, my aunt there, and Mr. Dick! My aunt sitting 
              on a quantity of luggage, with her two birds before her, and her 
              cat on her knee, like a female Robinson Crusoe, drinking tea. Mr. 
              Dick leaning thoughtfully on a great kite, such as we had often 
              been out together to fly, with more luggage piled about him! </p>
            <p>　　'My dear aunt!' cried I. 'Why, what an unexpected pleasure!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　We cordially embraced; and Mr. Dick and I cordially shook hands; 
              and Mrs. Crupp, who was busy making tea, and could not be too attentive, 
              cordially said she had knowed well as Mr. Copperfull would have 
              his heart in his mouth, when he see his dear relations. </p>
            <p>　　'Holloa!' said my aunt to Peggotty, who quailed before her awful 
              presence. 'How are YOU?' </p>
            <p>　　'You remember my aunt, Peggotty?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'For the love of goodness, child,' exclaimed my aunt, 'don't 
              call the woman by that South Sea Island name! If she married and 
              got rid of it, which was the best thing she could do, why don't 
              you give her the benefit of the change? What's your name now, - 
              P?' said my aunt, as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Barkis, ma'am,' said Peggotty, with a curtsey. </p>
            <p>　　'Well! That's human,' said my aunt. 'It sounds less as if you 
              wanted a missionary. How d'ye do, Barkis? I hope you're well?' </p>
            <p>　　Encouraged by these gracious words, and by my aunt's extending 
              her hand, Barkis came forward, and took the hand, and curtseyed 
              her acknowledgements. </p>
            <p>　　'We are older than we were, I see,' said my aunt. 'We have only 
              met each other once before, you know. A nice business we made of 
              it then! Trot, my dear, another cup.' </p>
            <p>　　I handed it dutifully to my aunt, who was in her usual inflexible 
              state of figure; and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject 
              of her sitting on a box. </p>
            <p>　　'Let me draw the sofa here, or the easy-chair, aunt,' said I. 
              'Why should you be so uncomfortable?' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, Trot,' replied my aunt, 'I prefer to sit upon my 
              property.' Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp, and observed, 
              'We needn't trouble you to wait, ma'am.' </p>
            <p>　　'Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?' 
              said Mrs. Crupp. 'No, I thank you, ma'am,' replied my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?' said Mrs. 
              Crupp. 'Or would you be persuaded to try a new-laid hegg? or should 
              I brile a rasher? Ain't there nothing I could do for your dear aunt, 
              Mr. Copperfull?' </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing, ma'am,' returned my aunt. 'I shall do very well, I 
              thank you.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Crupp, who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet 
              temper, and incessantly holding her head on one side, to express 
              a general feebleness of constitution, and incessantly rubbing her 
              hands, to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects, 
              gradually smiled herself, one-sided herself, and rubbed herself, 
              out of the room. 'Dick!' said my aunt. 'You know what I told you 
              about time-servers and wealth-worshippers?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick - with rather a scared look, as if he had forgotten 
              it - returned a hasty answer in the affirmative. </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Crupp is one of them,' said my aunt. 'Barkis, I'll trouble 
              you to look after the tea, and let me have another cup, for I don't 
              fancy that woman's pouring-out!' </p>
            <p>　　I knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something 
              of importance on her mind, and that there was far more matter in 
              this arrival than a stranger might have supposed. I noticed how 
              her eye lighted on me, when she thought my attention otherwise occupied; 
              and what a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on 
              within her, while she preserved her outward stiffness and composure. 
              I began to reflect whether I had done anything to offend her; and 
              my conscience whispered me that I had not yet told her about Dora. 
              Could it by any means be that, I wondered! </p>
            <p>　　As I knew she would only speak in her own good time, I sat down 
              near her, and spoke to the birds, and played with the cat, and was 
              as easy as I could be. But I was very far from being really easy; 
              and I should still have been so, even if Mr. Dick, leaning over 
              the great kite behind my aunt, had not taken every secret opportunity 
              of shaking his head darkly at me, and pointing at her. </p>
            <p>　　'Trot,' said my aunt at last, when she had finished her tea, 
              and carefully smoothed down her dress, and wiped her lips - 'you 
              needn't go, Barkis! - Trot, have you got to be firm and self-reliant?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I hope so, aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'What do you think?' inquired Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'I think so, aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then why, my love,' said my aunt, looking earnestly at me, 'why 
              do you think I prefer to sit upon this property of mine tonight?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head, unable to guess. </p>
            <p>　　'Because,' said my aunt, 'it's all I have. Because I'm ruined, 
              my dear!' </p>
            <p>　　If the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river 
              together, I could hardly have received a greater shock. </p>
            <p>　　'Dick knows it,' said my aunt, laying her hand calmly on my shoulder. 
              'I am ruined, my dear Trot! All I have in the world is in this room, 
              except the cottage; and that I have left Janet to let. Barkis, I 
              want to get a bed for this gentleman tonight. To save expense, perhaps 
              you can make up something here for myself. Anything will do. It's 
              only for tonight. We'll talk about this, more, tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　I was roused from my amazement, and concern for her - I am sure, 
              for her - by her falling on my neck, for a moment, and crying that 
              she only grieved for me. In another moment she suppressed this emotion; 
              and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected: </p>
            <p>　　'We must meet reverses boldly, and not suffer them to frighten 
              us, my dear. We must learn to act the play out. We must live misfortune 
              down, Trot!' </p>

            </div>
            <p>　　 Next morning, after breakfast, I entered on school life again. 
              I went, accompanied by Mr. Wickfield, to the scene of my future 
              studies - a grave building in a courtyard, with a learned air about 
              it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws 
              who came down from the Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing 
              on the grass-plot - and was introduced to my new master, Doctor 
              Strong. </p>
            <p>　　Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty, to my thinking, as the 
              tall iron rails and gates outside the house; and almost as stiff 
              and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them, and were set 
              up, on the top of the red-brick wall, at regular distances all round 
              the court, like sublimated skittles, for Time to play at. He was 
              in his library (I mean Doctor Strong was), with his clothes not 
              particularly well brushed, and his hair not particularly well combed; 
              his knee-smalls unbraced; his long black gaiters unbuttoned; and 
              his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearth-rug. Turning upon 
              me a lustreless eye, that reminded me of a long-forgotten blind 
              old horse who once used to crop the grass, and tumble over the graves, 
              in Blunderstone churchyard, he said he was glad to see me: and then 
              he gave me his hand; which I didn't know what to do with, as it 
              did nothing for itself. </p>
            <p>　　But, sitting at work, not far from Doctor Strong, was a very 
              pretty young lady - whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter, 
              I supposed - who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to 
              put Doctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she 
              did with great cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, 
              and we were going out to the schoolroom, I was much surprised to 
              hear Mr. Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as 
              'Mrs. Strong'; and I was wondering could she be Doctor Strong's 
              son's wife, or could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong 
              himself unconsciously enlightened me. </p>
            <p>　　'By the by, Wickfield,' he said, stopping in a passage with his 
              hand on my shoulder; 'you have not found any suitable provision 
              for my wife's cousin yet?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'No. Not yet.' </p>
            <p>　　'I could wish it done as soon as it can be done, Wickfield,' 
              said Doctor Strong, 'for Jack Maldon is needy, and idle; and of 
              those two bad things, worse things sometimes come. What does Doctor 
              Watts say,' he added, looking at me, and moving his head to the 
              time of his quotation, '&quot;Satan finds some mischief still, for 
              idle hands to do.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'Egad, Doctor,' returned Mr. Wickfield, 'if Doctor Watts knew 
              mankind, he might have written, with as much truth, &quot;Satan 
              finds some mischief still, for busy hands to do.&quot; The busy 
              people achieve their full share of mischief in the world, you may 
              rely upon it. What have the people been about, who have been the 
              busiest in getting money, and in getting power, this century or 
              two? No mischief?' </p>
            <p>　　'Jack Maldon will never be very busy in getting either, I expect,' 
              said Doctor Strong, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps not,' said Mr. Wickfield; 'and you bring me back to 
              the question, with an apology for digressing. No, I have not been 
              able to dispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet. I believe,' he said this 
              with some hesitation, 'I penetrate your motive, and it makes the 
              thing more difficult.' </p>
            <p>　　'My motive,' returned Doctor Strong, 'is to make some suitable 
              provision for a cousin, and an old playfellow, of Annie's.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I know,' said Mr. Wickfield; 'at home or abroad.' </p>
            <p>　　'Aye!' replied the Doctor, apparently wondering why he emphasized 
              those words so much. 'At home or abroad.' </p>
            <p>　　'Your own expression, you know,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Or abroad.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Surely,' the Doctor answered. 'Surely. One or other.' </p>
            <p>　　'One or other? Have you no choice?' asked Mr. Wickfield. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' returned the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'No?' with astonishment. </p>
            <p>　　'Not the least.' </p>
            <p>　　'No motive,' said Mr. Wickfield, 'for meaning abroad, and not 
              at home?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' returned the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'I am bound to believe you, and of course I do believe you,' 
              said Mr. Wickfield. 'It might have simplified my office very much, 
              if I had known it before. But I confess I entertained another impression.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Doctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look, 
              which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great 
              encouragement; for it was full of amiability and sweetness, and 
              there was a simplicity in it, and indeed in his whole manner, when 
              the studious, pondering frost upon it was got through, very attractive 
              and hopeful to a young scholar like me. Repeating 'no', and 'not 
              the least', and other short assurances to the same purport, Doctor 
              Strong jogged on before us, at a queer, uneven pace; and we followed: 
              Mr. Wickfield, looking grave, I observed, and shaking his head to 
              himself, without knowing that I saw him. </p>
            <p>　　The schoolroom was a pretty large hall, on the quietest side 
              of the house, confronted by the stately stare of some half-dozen 
              of the great urns, and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden 
              belonging to the Doctor, where the peaches were ripening on the 
              sunny south wall. There were two great aloes, in tubs, on the turf 
              outside the windows; the broad hard leaves of which plant (looking 
              as if they were made of painted tin) have ever since, by association, 
              been symbolical to me of silence and retirement. About five-and-twenty 
              boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in, but 
              they rose to give the Doctor good morning, and remained standing 
              when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me. </p>
            <p>　　'A new boy, young gentlemen,' said the Doctor; 'Trotwood Copperfield.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　One Adams, who was the head-boy, then stepped out of his place 
              and welcomed me. He looked like a young clergyman, in his white 
              cravat, but he was very affable and good-humoured; and he showed 
              me my place, and presented me to the masters, in a gentlemanly way 
              that would have put me at my ease, if anything could. </p>
            <p>　　It seemed to me so long, however, since I had been among such 
              boys, or among any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker 
              and Mealy Potatoes, that I felt as strange as ever I have done in 
              my life. I was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which 
              they could have no knowledge, and of having acquired experiences 
              foreign to my age, appearance, and condition as one of them, that 
              I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary 
              little schoolboy. I had become, in the Murdstone and Grinby time, 
              however short or long it may have been, so unused to the sports 
              and games of boys, that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in 
              the commonest things belonging to them. Whatever I had learnt, had 
              so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day 
              to night, that now, when I was examined about what I knew, I knew 
              nothing, and was put into the lowest form of the school. But, troubled 
              as I was, by my want of boyish skill, and of book-learning too, 
              I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration, that, 
              in what I did know, I was much farther removed from my companions 
              than in what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think, 
              if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? 
              Was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in 
              connexion with the Micawber family - all those pawnings, and sellings, 
              and suppers - in spite of myself? Suppose some of the boys had seen 
              me coming through Canterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find 
              me out? What would they say, who made so light of money, if they 
              could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase 
              of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding? How would 
              it affect them, who were so innocent of London life, and London 
              streets, to discover how knowing I was (and was ashamed to be) in 
              some of the meanest phases of both? All this ran in my head so much, 
              on that first day at Doctor Strong's, that I felt distrustful of 
              my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within myself whensoever I 
              was approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried off the 
              minute school was over, afraid of committing myself in my response 
              to any friendly notice or advance. </p>
            <p>　　But there was such an influence in Mr. Wickfield's old house, 
              that when I knocked at it, with my new school-books under my arm, 
              I began to feel my uneasiness softening away. As I went up to my 
              airy old room, the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall 
              upon my doubts and fears, and to make the past more indistinct. 
              I sat there, sturdily conning my books, until dinner-time (we were 
              out of school for good at three); and went down, hopeful of becoming 
              a passable sort of boy yet. </p>
            <p>　　Agnes was in the drawing-room, waiting for her father, who was 
              detained by someone in his office. She met me with her pleasant 
              smile, and asked me how I liked the school. I told her I should 
              like it very much, I hoped; but I was a little strange to it at 
              first. </p>
            <p>　　'You have never been to school,' I said, 'have you?' 'Oh yes! 
              Every day.' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?' </p>
            <p>　　'Papa couldn't spare me to go anywhere else,' she answered, smiling 
              and shaking her head. 'His housekeeper must be in his house, you 
              know.' </p>
            <p>　　'He is very fond of you, I am sure,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　She nodded 'Yes,' and went to the door to listen for his coming 
              up, that she might meet him on the stairs. But, as he was not there, 
              she came back again. </p>
            <p>　　'Mama has been dead ever since I was born,' she said, in her 
              quiet way. 'I only know her picture, downstairs. I saw you looking 
              at it yesterday. Did you think whose it was?' </p>
            <p>　　I told her yes, because it was so like herself. </p>
            <p>　　'Papa says so, too,' said Agnes, pleased. 'Hark! That's papa 
              now!' </p>
            <p>　　Her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to 
              meet him, and as they came in, hand in hand. He greeted me cordially; 
              and told me I should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong, who 
              was one of the gentlest of men. </p>
            <p>　　'There may be some, perhaps - I don't know that there are - who 
              abuse his kindness,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Never be one of those, 
              Trotwood, in anything. He is the least suspicious of mankind; and 
              whether that's a merit, or whether it's a blemish, it deserves consideration 
              in all dealings with the Doctor, great or small.' </p>
            <p>　　He spoke, I thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with 
              something; but I did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner 
              was just then announced, and we went down and took the same seats 
              as before. </p>
            <p>　　We had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep put in his red head 
              and his lank hand at the door, and said: </p>
            <p>　　'Here's Mr. Maldon begs the favour of a word, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon,' said his master. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, sir,' returned Uriah; 'but Mr. Maldon has come back, and 
              he begs the favour of a word.' </p>
            <p>　　As he held the door open with his hand, Uriah looked at me, and 
              looked at Agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked at the plates, 
              and looked at every object in the room, I thought, - yet seemed 
              to look at nothing; he made such an appearance all the while of 
              keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master. 'I beg your pardon. 
              It's only to say, on reflection,' observed a voice behind Uriah, 
              as Uriah's head was pushed away, and the speaker's substituted - 
              'pray excuse me for this intrusion - that as it seems I have no 
              choice in the matter, the sooner I go abroad the better. My cousin 
              Annie did say, when we talked of it, that she liked to have her 
              friends within reach rather than to have them banished, and the 
              old Doctor -' </p>
            <p>　　'Doctor Strong, was that?' Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Doctor Strong, of course,' returned the other; 'I call him the 
              old Doctor; it's all the same, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know,' returned Mr. Wickfield. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Doctor Strong,' said the other - 'Doctor Strong was of 
              the same mind, I believed. But as it appears from the course you 
              take with me he has changed his mind, why there's no more to be 
              said, except that the sooner I am off, the better. Therefore, I 
              thought I'd come back and say, that the sooner I am off the better. 
              When a plunge is to be made into the water, it's of no use lingering 
              on the bank.' </p>
            <p>　　'There shall be as little lingering as possible, in your case, 
              Mr. Maldon, you may depend upon it,' said Mr. Wickfield. </p>
            <p>　　'Thank'ee,' said the other. 'Much obliged. I don't want to look 
              a gift-horse in the mouth, which is not a gracious thing to do; 
              otherwise, I dare say, my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in 
              her own way. I suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'Meaning that Mrs. Strong would only have to say to her husband 
              - do I follow you?' said Mr. Wickfield. </p>
            <p>　　'Quite so,' returned the other, '- would only have to say, that 
              she wanted such and such a thing to be so and so; and it would be 
              so and so, as a matter of course.' 'And why as a matter of course, 
              Mr. Maldon?' asked Mr. Wickfield, sedately eating his dinner. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, because Annie's a charming young girl, and the old Doctor 
              - Doctor Strong, I mean - is not quite a charming young boy,' said 
              Mr. Jack Maldon, laughing. 'No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield. 
              I only mean that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable 
              in that sort of marriage.' </p>
            <p>　　'Compensation to the lady, sir?' asked Mr. Wickfield gravely. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'To the lady, sir,' Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing. But appearing 
              to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same 
              sedate, immovable manner, and that there was no hope of making him 
              relax a muscle of his face, he added: 'However, I have said what 
              I came to say, and, with another apology for this intrusion, I may 
              take myself off. Of course I shall observe your directions, in considering 
              the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely, and 
              not to be referred to, up at the Doctor's.' </p>
            <p>　　'Have you dined?' asked Mr. Wickfield, with a motion of his hand 
              towards the table. </p>
            <p>　　'Thank'ee. I am going to dine,' said Mr. Maldon, 'with my cousin 
              Annie. Good-bye!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully 
              as he went out. He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, 
              I thought, with a handsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, 
              bold air. And this was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon; 
              whom I had not expected to see so soon, when I heard the Doctor 
              speak of him that morning. </p>
            <p>　　When we had dined, we went upstairs again, where everything went 
              on exactly as on the previous day. Agnes set the glasses and decanters 
              in the same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank 
              a good deal. Agnes played the piano to him, sat by him, and worked 
              and talked, and played some games at dominoes with me. In good time 
              she made tea; and afterwards, when I brought down my books, looked 
              into them, and showed me what she knew of them (which was no slight 
              matter, though she said it was), and what was the best way to learn 
              and understand them. I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid 
              manner, and I hear her beautiful calm voice, as I write these words. 
              The influence for all good, which she came to exercise over me at 
              a later time, begins already to descend upon my breast. I love little 
              Em'ly, and I don't love Agnes - no, not at all in that way - but 
              I feel that there are goodness, peace, and truth, wherever Agnes 
              is; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church, 
              seen long ago, falls on her always, and on me when I am near her, 
              and on everything around. </p>
            <p>　　The time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she 
              having left us, I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going 
              away myself. But he checked me and said: 'Should you like to stay 
              with us, Trotwood, or to go elsewhere?' </p>
            <p>　　'To stay,' I answered, quickly. </p>
            <p>　　'You are sure?' </p>
            <p>　　'If you please. If I may!' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, it's but a dull life that we lead here, boy, I am afraid,' 
              he said. </p>
            <p>　　'Not more dull for me than Agnes, sir. Not dull at all!' </p>
            <p>　　'Than Agnes,' he repeated, walking slowly to the great chimney-piece, 
              and leaning against it. 'Than Agnes!' </p>
            <p>　　He had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes 
              were bloodshot. Not that I could see them now, for they were cast 
              down, and shaded by his hand; but I had noticed them a little while 
              before. </p>
            <p>　　'Now I wonder,' he muttered, 'whether my Agnes tires of me. When 
              should I ever tire of her! But that's different, that's quite different.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He was musing, not speaking to me; so I remained quiet. </p>
            <p>　　'A dull old house,' he said, 'and a monotonous life; but I must 
              have her near me. I must keep her near me. If the thought that I 
              may die and leave my darling, or that my darling may die and leave 
              me, comes like a spectre, to distress my happiest hours, and is 
              only to be drowned in -' </p>
            <p>　　He did not supply the word; but pacing slowly to the place where 
              he had sat, and mechanically going through the action of pouring 
              wine from the empty decanter, set it down and paced back again. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'If it is miserable to bear, when she is here,' he said, 'what 
              would it be, and she away? No, no, no. I cannot try that.' </p>
            <p>　　He leaned against the chimney-piece, brooding so long that I 
              could not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going, 
              or to remain quietly where I was, until he should come out of his 
              reverie. At length he aroused himself, and looked about the room 
              until his eyes encountered mine. </p>
            <p>　　'Stay with us, Trotwood, eh?' he said in his usual manner, and 
              as if he were answering something I had just said. 'I am glad of 
              it. You are company to us both. It is wholesome to have you here. 
              Wholesome for me, wholesome for Agnes, wholesome perhaps for all 
              of us.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure it is for me, sir,' I said. 'I am so glad to be here.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'That's a fine fellow!' said Mr. Wickfield. 'As long as you are 
              glad to be here, you shall stay here.' He shook hands with me upon 
              it, and clapped me on the back; and told me that when I had anything 
              to do at night after Agnes had left us, or when I wished to read 
              for my own pleasure, I was free to come down to his room, if he 
              were there and if I desired it for company's sake, and to sit with 
              him. I thanked him for his consideration; and, as he went down soon 
              afterwards, and I was not tired, went down too, with a book in my 
              hand, to avail myself, for half-an-hour, of his permission. </p>
            <p>　　But, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately 
              feeling myself attracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fascination 
              for me, I went in there instead. I found Uriah reading a great fat 
              book, with such demonstrative attention, that his lank forefinger 
              followed up every line as he read, and made clammy tracks along 
              the page (or so I fully believed) like a snail. </p>
            <p>　　'You are working late tonight, Uriah,' says I. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, Master Copperfield,' says Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　As I was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more conveniently, 
              I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him, and 
              that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down 
              his cheeks, one on each side, to stand for one. </p>
            <p>　　'I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'What work, then?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,' said 
              Uriah. 'I am going through Tidd's Practice. Oh, what a writer Mr. 
              Tidd is, Master Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　My stool was such a tower of observation, that as I watched him 
              reading on again, after this rapturous exclamation, and following 
              up the lines with his forefinger, I observed that his nostrils, 
              which were thin and pointed, with sharp dints in them, had a singular 
              and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contracting themselves 
              - that they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes, which hardly 
              ever twinkled at all. </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?' I said, after looking 
              at him for some time. </p>
            <p>　　'Me, Master Copperfield?' said Uriah. 'Oh, no! I'm a very umble 
              person.' </p>
            <p>　　It was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he frequently 
              ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and 
              warm, besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his pocket-handkerchief. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am well aware that I am the umblest person going,' said Uriah 
              Heep, modestly; 'let the other be where he may. My mother is likewise 
              a very umble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, 
              but have much to be thankful for. My father's former calling was 
              umble. He was a sexton.' </p>
            <p>　　'What is he now?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'He is a partaker of glory at present, Master Copperfield,' said 
              Uriah Heep. 'But we have much to be thankful for. How much have 
              I to be thankful for in living with Mr. Wickfield!' </p>
            <p>　　I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long? </p>
            <p>　　'I have been with him, going on four year, Master Copperfield,' 
              said Uriah; shutting up his book, after carefully marking the place 
              where he had left off. 'Since a year after my father's death. How 
              much have I to be thankful for, in that! How much have I to be thankful 
              for, in Mr. Wickfield's kind intention to give me my articles, which 
              would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, 
              I suppose?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'With the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield,' returned 
              Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps you'll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield's business, one 
              of these days,' I said, to make myself agreeable; 'and it will be 
              Wickfield and Heep, or Heep late Wickfield.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh no, Master Copperfield,' returned Uriah, shaking his head, 
              'I am much too umble for that!' </p>
            <p>　　He certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the 
              beam outside my window, as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, 
              with his mouth widened, and the creases in his cheeks. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man, Master Copperfield,' 
              said Uriah. 'If you have known him long, you know it, I am sure, 
              much better than I can inform you.' </p>

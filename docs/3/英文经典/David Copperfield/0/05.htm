            <p>　　 If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing 
              that could give evidence, I might appeal to it at this day - who 
              sleeps there now, I wonder! - to bear witness for me what a heavy 
              heart I carried to it. I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard 
              bark after me all the way while I climbed the stairs; and, looking 
              as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me, sat 
              down with my small hands crossed, and thought. </p>
            <p>　　I thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of 
              the cracks in the ceiling, of the paper on the walls, of the flaws 
              in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, 
              of the washing-stand being rickety on its three legs, and having 
              a discontented something about it, which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge 
              under the influence of the old one. I was crying all the time, but, 
              except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure 
              I never thought why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to 
              consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had 
              been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want 
              me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This made such 
              a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up 
              in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep. </p>
            <p>　　I was awoke by somebody saying 'Here he is!' and uncovering my 
              hot head. My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it 
              was one of them who had done it. </p>
            <p>　　'Davy,' said my mother. 'What's the matter?' </p>
            <p>　　I thought it was very strange that she should ask me, and answered, 
              'Nothing.' I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling 
              lip, which answered her with greater truth. 'Davy,' said my mother. 
              'Davy, my child!' </p>
            <p>　　I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected 
              me so much, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in 
              the bedclothes, and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would 
              have raised me up. </p>
            <p>　　'This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!' said my mother. 
              'I have no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your 
              conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against 
              anybody who is dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, 
              in a sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, 
              'Lord forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said 
              this minute, may you never be truly sorry!' </p>
            <p>　　'It's enough to distract me,' cried my mother. 'In my honeymoon, 
              too, when my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, 
              and not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you 
              naughty boy! Peggotty, you savage creature! Oh, dear me!' cried 
              my mother, turning from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful 
              manner, 'what a troublesome world this is, when one has the most 
              right to expect it to be as agreeable as possible!' </p>
            <p>　　I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither hers nor Peggotty's, 
              and slipped to my feet at the bed-side. It was Mr. Murdstone's hand, 
              and he kept it on my arm as he said: </p>
            <p>　　'What's this? Clara, my love, have you forgotten? - Firmness, 
              my dear!' </p>
            <p>　　'I am very sorry, Edward,' said my mother. 'I meant to be very 
              good, but I am so uncomfortable.' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed!' he answered. 'That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I say it's very hard I should be made so now,' returned my mother, 
              pouting; 'and it is - very hard - isn't it?' </p>
            <p>　　He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew 
              as well, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, 
              and her arm touch his neck - I knew as well that he could mould 
              her pliant nature into any form he chose, as I know, now, that he 
              did it. </p>
            <p>　　'Go you below, my love,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'David and I will 
              come down, together. My friend,' turning a darkening face on Peggotty, 
              when he had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod 
              and a smile; 'do you know your mistress's name?' </p>
            <p>　　'She has been my mistress a long time, sir,' answered Peggotty, 
              'I ought to know it.' 'That's true,' he answered. 'But I thought 
              I heard you, as I came upstairs, address her by a name that is not 
              hers. She has taken mine, you know. Will you remember that?' </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out 
              of the room without replying; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected 
              to go, and had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, 
              he shut the door, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing 
              before him, looked steadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, 
              no less steadily, to his. As I recall our being opposed thus, face 
              to face, I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high. </p>
            <p>　　'David,' he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together, 
              'if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think 
              I do?' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know.' </p>
            <p>　　'I beat him.' </p>
            <p>　　I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in 
              my silence, that my breath was shorter now. </p>
            <p>　　'I make him wince, and smart. I say to myself, &quot;I'll conquer 
              that fellow&quot;; and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, 
              I should do it. What is that upon your face?' </p>
            <p>　　'Dirt,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had 
              asked the question twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I 
              believe my baby heart would have burst before I would have told 
              him so. </p>
            <p>　　'You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow,' he 
              said, with a grave smile that belonged to him, 'and you understood 
              me very well, I see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like 
              Mrs. Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. 
              I had little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would 
              have knocked me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Clara, my dear,' he said, when I had done his bidding, and he 
              walked me into the parlour, with his hand still on my arm; 'you 
              will not be made uncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve 
              our youthful humours.' </p>
            <p>　　God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I 
              might have been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind 
              word at that season. A word of encouragement and explanation, of 
              pity for my childish ignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance 
              to me that it was home, might have made me dutiful to him in my 
              heart henceforth, instead of in my hypocritical outside, and might 
              have made me respect instead of hate him. I thought my mother was 
              sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange, and 
              that, presently, when I stole to a chair, she followed me with her 
              eyes more sorrowfully still - missing, perhaps, some freedom in 
              my childish tread - but the word was not spoken, and the time for 
              it was gone. </p>
            <p>　　We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond 
              of my mother - I am afraid I liked him none the better for that 
              - and she was very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, 
              that an elder sister of his was coming to stay with them, and that 
              she was expected that evening. I am not certain whether I found 
              out then, or afterwards, that, without being actively concerned 
              in any business, he had some share in, or some annual charge upon 
              the profits of, a wine-merchant's house in London, with which his 
              family had been connected from his great-grandfather's time, and 
              in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may mention it 
              in this place, whether or no. </p>
            <p>　　After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating 
              an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, 
              lest it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up 
              to the garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother 
              followed him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round 
              at the parlour door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as 
              she had been used to do, whispered me to love my new father and 
              be obedient to him. She did this hurriedly and secretly, as if it 
              were wrong, but tenderly; and, putting out her hand behind her, 
              held mine in it, until we came near to where he was standing in 
              the garden, where she let mine go, and drew hers through his arm. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady 
              she was; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face 
              and voice; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her 
              large nose, as if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from 
              wearing whiskers, she had carried them to that account. She brought 
              with her two uncompromising hard black boxes, with her initials 
              on the lids in hard brass nails. When she paid the coachman she 
              took her money out of a hard steel purse, and she kept the purse 
              in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain, 
              and shut up like a bite. I had never, at that time, seen such a 
              metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was. </p>
            <p>　　She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome, 
              and there formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation. 
              Then she looked at me, and said: </p>
            <p>　　'Is that your boy, sister-in-law?' </p>
            <p>　　My mother acknowledged me. </p>
            <p>　　'Generally speaking,' said Miss Murdstone, 'I don't like boys. 
              How d'ye do, boy?' </p>
            <p>　　Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very 
              well, and that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent 
              grace, that Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words: </p>
            <p>　　'Wants manner!' </p>
            <p>　　Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the 
              favour of being shown to her room, which became to me from that 
              time forth a place of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes 
              were never seen open or known to be left unlocked, and where (for 
              I peeped in once or twice when she was out) numerous little steel 
              fetters and rivets, with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself 
              when she was dressed, generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable 
              array. </p>
            <p>　　As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no 
              intention of ever going again. She began to 'help' my mother next 
              morning, and was in and out of the store-closet all day, putting 
              things to rights, and making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost 
              the first remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her 
              being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a 
              man secreted somewhere on the premises. Under the influence of this 
              delusion, she dived into the coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, 
              and scarcely ever opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping 
              it to again, in the belief that she had got him. </p>
            <p>　　Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she 
              was a perfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I 
              believe to this hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the 
              house was stirring. Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even 
              slept with one eye open; but I could not concur in this idea; for 
              I tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out, and found 
              it couldn't be done. </p>
            <p>　　On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing 
              her bell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and 
              was going to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck 
              on the cheek, which was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you 
              of all the trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtless' 
              - my mother blushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this 
              character - 'to have any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken 
              by me. If you'll be so good as give me your keys, my dear, I'll 
              attend to all this sort of thing in future.' </p>
            <p>　　From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little 
              jail all day, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had 
              no more to do with them than I had. </p>
            <p>　　My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without 
              a shadow of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing 
              certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his 
              approbation, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought 
              she might have been consulted. </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' said Mr. Murdstone sternly. 'Clara! I wonder at you.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward!' cried my mother, 
              'and it's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't 
              like it yourself.' </p>
            <p>　　Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both 
              Mr. and Miss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed 
              my comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, 
              I nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was 
              another name for tyranny; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's 
              humour, that was in them both. The creed, as I should state it now, 
              was this. Mr. Murdstone was firm; nobody in his world was to be 
              so firm as Mr. Murdstone; nobody else in his world was to be firm 
              at all, for everybody was to be bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone 
              was an exception. She might be firm, but only by relationship, and 
              in an inferior and tributary degree. My mother was another exception. 
              She might be firm, and must be; but only in bearing their firmness, 
              and firmly believing there was no other firmness upon earth. </p>
            <p>　　'It's very hard,' said my mother, 'that in my own house -' </p>
            <p>　　'My own house?' repeated Mr. Murdstone. 'Clara!' </p>
            <p>　　'OUR own house, I mean,' faltered my mother, evidently frightened 
              - 'I hope you must know what I mean, Edward - it's very hard that 
              in YOUR own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters. 
              I am sure I managed very well before we were married. There's evidence,' 
              said my mother, sobbing; 'ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well 
              when I wasn't interfered with!' </p>
            <p>　　'Edward,' said Miss Murdstone, 'let there be an end of this. 
              I go tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　'Jane Murdstone,' said her brother, 'be silent! How dare you 
              to insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words 
              imply?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure,' my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, 
              and with many tears, 'I don't want anybody to go. I should be very 
              miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I 
              am not unreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am 
              very much obliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to 
              be consulted as a mere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, 
              once, with my being a little inexperienced and girlish, Edward - 
              I am sure you said so - but you seem to hate me for it now, you 
              are so severe.' </p>
            <p>　　'Edward,' said Miss Murdstone, again, 'let there be an end of 
              this. I go tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　'Jane Murdstone,' thundered Mr. Murdstone. 'Will you be silent? 
              How dare you?' </p>
            <p>　　Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, 
              and held it before her eyes. </p>
            <p>　　'Clara,' he continued, looking at my mother, 'you surprise me! 
              You astound me! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying 
              an inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, 
              and infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of 
              which it stood in need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to 
              come to my assistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, 
              a condition something like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with 
              a base return -' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, pray, pray, Edward,' cried my mother, 'don't accuse me of 
              being ungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said 
              I was before. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,' he went on, after waiting 
              until my mother was silent, 'with a base return, that feeling of 
              mine is chilled and altered.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't, my love, say that!' implored my mother very piteously. 
              'Oh, don't, Edward! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am 
              affectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I 
              wasn't sure that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she'll tell you I'm 
              affectionate.' </p>
            <p>　　'There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone 
              in reply, 'that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Pray let us be friends,' said my mother, 'I couldn't live under 
              coldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, 
              I know, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of 
              mind, to endeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object 
              to anything. I should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of 
              leaving -' My mother was too much overcome to go on. </p>
            <p>　　'Jane Murdstone,' said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, 'any harsh 
              words between us are, I hope, uncommon. It is not my fault that 
              so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight. I was betrayed 
              into it by another. Nor is it your fault. You were betrayed into 
              it by another. Let us both try to forget it. And as this,' he added, 
              after these magnanimous words, 'is not a fit scene for the boy - 
              David, go to bed!' I could hardly find the door, through the tears 
              that stood in my eyes. I was so sorry for my mother's distress; 
              but I groped my way out, and groped my way up to my room in the 
              dark, without even having the heart to say good night to Peggotty, 
              or to get a candle from her. When her coming up to look for me, 
              an hour or so afterwards, awoke me, she said that my mother had 
              gone to bed poorly, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting 
              alone. </p>
            <p>　　Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside 
              the parlour door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly 
              and humbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted, 
              and a perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother 
              afterwards to give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing 
              to Miss Murdstone, or without having first ascertained by some sure 
              means, what Miss Murdstone's opinion was; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, 
              when out of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards 
              her bag as if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign 
              them to my mother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible 
              fright. </p>

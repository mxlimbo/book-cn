            <div align="center"><b>Mr. MICAWBER'S GAUNTLET </b> </div>
            <p>　　 Until the day arrived on which I was to entertain my newly-found 
              old friends, I lived principally on Dora and coffee. In my love-lorn 
              condition, my appetite languished; and I was glad of it, for I felt 
              as though it would have been an act of perfidy towards Dora to have 
              a natural relish for my dinner. The quantity of walking exercise 
              I took, was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence, 
              as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air. I have my doubts, 
              too, founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of 
              my life, whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself 
              freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight 
              boots. I think the extremities require to be at peace before the 
              stomach will conduct itself with vigour. </p>
            <p>　　On the occasion of this domestic little party, I did not repeat 
              my former extensive preparations. I merely provided a pair of soles, 
              a small leg of mutton, and a pigeon-pie. Mrs. Crupp broke out into 
              rebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of 
              the fish and joint, and said, with a dignified sense of injury, 
              'No! No, sir! You will not ask me sich a thing, for you are better 
              acquainted with me than to suppose me capable of doing what I cannot 
              do with ampial satisfaction to my own feelings!' But, in the end, 
              a compromise was effected; and Mrs. Crupp consented to achieve this 
              feat, on condition that I dined from home for a fortnight afterwards. 
            </p>
            <p>　　And here I may remark, that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp, 
              in consequence of the tyranny she established over me, was dreadful. 
              I never was so much afraid of anyone. We made a compromise of everything. 
              If I hesitated, she was taken with that wonderful disorder which 
              was always lying in ambush in her system, ready, at the shortest 
              notice, to prey upon her vitals. If I rang the bell impatiently, 
              after half-a-dozen unavailing modest pulls, and she appeared at 
              last - which was not by any means to be relied upon - she would 
              appear with a reproachful aspect, sink breathless on a chair near 
              the door, lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom, and become so ill, 
              that I was glad, at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else, to 
              get rid of her. If I objected to having my bed made at five o'clock 
              in the afternoon - which I do still think an uncomfortable arrangement 
              - one motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of wounded 
              sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology. In short, I 
              would have done anything in an honourable way rather than give Mrs. 
              Crupp offence; and she was the terror of my life. </p>
            <p>　　I bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party, in 
              preference to re-engaging the handy young man; against whom I had 
              conceived a prejudice, in consequence of meeting him in the Strand, 
              one Sunday morning, in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine, 
              which had been missing since the former occasion. The 'young gal' 
              was re-engaged; but on the stipulation that she should only bring 
              in the dishes, and then withdraw to the landing-place, beyond the 
              outer door; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be 
              lost upon the guests, and where her retiring on the plates would 
              be a physical impossibility. </p>
            <p>　　Having laid in the materials for a bowl of punch, to be compounded 
              by Mr. Micawber; having provided a bottle of lavender-water, two 
              wax-candles, a paper of mixed pins, and a pincushion, to assist 
              Mrs. Micawber in her toilette at my dressing-table; having also 
              caused the fire in my bedroom to be lighted for Mrs. Micawber's 
              convenience; and having laid the cloth with my own hands, I awaited 
              the result with composure. </p>
            <p>　　At the appointed time, my three visitors arrived together. Mr. 
              Micawber with more shirt-collar than usual, and a new ribbon to 
              his eye-glass; Mrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper 
              parcel; Traddles carrying the parcel, and supporting Mrs. Micawber 
              on his arm. They were all delighted with my residence. When I conducted 
              Mrs. Micawber to my dressing-table, and she saw the scale on which 
              it was prepared for her, she was in such raptures, that she called 
              Mr. Micawber to come in and look. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'this is luxurious. 
              This is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was 
              myself in a state of celibacy, and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been 
              solicited to plight her faith at the Hymeneal altar.' </p>
            <p>　　'He means, solicited by him, Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 
              archly. 'He cannot answer for others.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, 'I 
              have no desire to answer for others. I am too well aware that when, 
              in the inscrutable decrees of Fate, you were reserved for me, it 
              is possible you may have been reserved for one, destined, after 
              a protracted struggle, at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements 
              of a complicated nature. I understand your allusion, my love. I 
              regret it, but I can bear it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber!' exclaimed Mrs. Micawber, in tears. 'Have I deserved 
              this! I, who never have deserted you; who never WILL desert you, 
              Micawber!' 'My love,' said Mr. Micawber, much affected, 'you will 
              forgive, and our old and tried friend Copperfield will, I am sure, 
              forgive, the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit, made sensitive 
              by a recent collision with the Minion of Power - in other words, 
              with a ribald Turncock attached to the water-works - and will pity, 
              not condemn, its excesses.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber, and pressed my hand; 
              leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic 
              supply of water had been cut off that afternoon, in consequence 
              of default in the payment of the company's rates. </p>
            <p>　　To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject, I informed 
              Mr. Micawber that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch, and led 
              him to the lemons. His recent despondency, not to say despair, was 
              gone in a moment. I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself 
              amid the fragrance of lemon-peel and sugar, the odour of burning 
              rum, and the steam of boiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon. 
              It was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud 
              of these delicate fumes, as he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and 
              looked as if he were making, instead of punch, a fortune for his 
              family down to the latest posterity. As to Mrs. Micawber, I don't 
              know whether it was the effect of the cap, or the lavender-water, 
              or the pins, or the fire, or the wax-candles, but she came out of 
              my room, comparatively speaking, lovely. And the lark was never 
              gayer than that excellent woman. </p>
            <p>　　I suppose - I never ventured to inquire, but I suppose - that 
              Mrs. Crupp, after frying the soles, was taken ill. Because we broke 
              down at that point. The leg of mutton came up very red within, and 
              very pale without: besides having a foreign substance of a gritty 
              nature sprinkled over it, as if if had had a fall into the ashes 
              of that remarkable kitchen fireplace. But we were not in condition 
              to judge of this fact from the appearance of the gravy, forasmuch 
              as the 'young gal' had dropped it all upon the stairs - where it 
              remained, by the by, in a long train, until it was worn out. The 
              pigeon-pie was not bad, but it was a delusive pie: the crust being 
              like a disappointing head, phrenologically speaking: full of lumps 
              and bumps, with nothing particular underneath. In short, the banquet 
              was such a failure that I should have been quite unhappy - about 
              the failure, I mean, for I was always unhappy about Dora - if I 
              had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company, and 
              by a bright suggestion from Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear friend Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'accidents will 
              occur in the best-regulated families; and in families not regulated 
              by that pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances the 
              - a - I would say, in short, by the influence of Woman, in the lofty 
              character of Wife, they may be expected with confidence, and must 
              be borne with philosophy. If you will allow me to take the liberty 
              of remarking that there are few comestibles better, in their way, 
              than a Devil, and that I believe, with a little division of labour, 
              we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance 
              could produce a gridiron, I would put it to you, that this little 
              misfortune may be easily repaired.' </p>
            <p>　　There was a gridiron in the pantry, on which my morning rasher 
              of bacon was cooked. We had it in, in a twinkling, and immediately 
              applied ourselves to carrying Mr. Micawber's idea into effect. The 
              division of labour to which he had referred was this: - Traddles 
              cut the mutton into slices; Mr. Micawber (who could do anything 
              of this sort to perfection) covered them with pepper, mustard, salt, 
              and cayenne; I put them on the gridiron, turned them with a fork, 
              and took them off, under Mr. Micawber's direction; and Mrs. Micawber 
              heated, and continually stirred, some mushroom ketchup in a little 
              saucepan. When we had slices enough done to begin upon, we fell-to, 
              with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrist, more slices sputtering 
              and blazing on the fire, and our attention divided between the mutton 
              on our plates, and the mutton then preparing. </p>
            <p>　　What with the novelty of this cookery, the excellence of it, 
              the bustle of it, the frequent starting up to look after it, the 
              frequent sitting down to dispose of it as the crisp slices came 
              off the gridiron hot and hot, the being so busy, so flushed with 
              the fire, so amused, and in the midst of such a tempting noise and 
              savour, we reduced the leg of mutton to the bone. My own appetite 
              came back miraculously. I am ashamed to record it, but I really 
              believe I forgot Dora for a little while. I am satisfied that Mr. 
              and Mrs. Micawber could not have enjoyed the feast more, if they 
              had sold a bed to provide it. Traddles laughed as heartily, almost 
              the whole time, as he ate and worked. Indeed we all did, all at 
              once; and I dare say there was never a greater success. </p>
            <p>　　We were at the height of our enjoyment, and were all busily engaged, 
              in our several departments, endeavouring to bring the last batch 
              of slices to a state of perfection that should crown the feast, 
              when I was aware of a strange presence in the room, and my eyes 
              encountered those of the staid Littimer, standing hat in hand before 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　'What's the matter?' I involuntarily asked. </p>
            <p>　　'I beg your pardon, sir, I was directed to come in. Is my master 
              not here, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'No.' </p>
            <p>　　'Have you not seen him, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'No; don't you come from him?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not immediately so, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'Did he tell you you would find him here?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not exactly so, sir. But I should think he might be here tomorrow, 
              as he has not been here today.' 'Is he coming up from Oxford?' </p>
            <p>　　'I beg, sir,' he returned respectfully, 'that you will be seated, 
              and allow me to do this.' With which he took the fork from my unresisting 
              hand, and bent over the gridiron, as if his whole attention were 
              concentrated on it. </p>
            <p>　　We should not have been much discomposed, I dare say, by the 
              appearance of Steerforth himself, but we became in a moment the 
              meekest of the meek before his respectable serving-man. Mr. Micawber, 
              humming a tune, to show that he was quite at ease, subsided into 
              his chair, with the handle of a hastily concealed fork sticking 
              out of the bosom of his coat, as if he had stabbed himself. Mrs. 
              Micawber put on her brown gloves, and assumed a genteel languor. 
              Traddles ran his greasy hands through his hair, and stood it bolt 
              upright, and stared in confusion on the table-cloth. As for me, 
              I was a mere infant at the head of my own table; and hardly ventured 
              to glance at the respectable phenomenon, who had come from Heaven 
              knows where, to put my establishment to rights. Meanwhile he took 
              the mutton off the gridiron, and gravely handed it round. We all 
              took some, but our appreciation of it was gone, and we merely made 
              a show of eating it. As we severally pushed away our plates, he 
              noiselessly removed them, and set on the cheese. He took that off, 
              too, when it was done with; cleared the table; piled everything 
              on the dumb-waiter; gave us our wine-glasses; and, of his own accord, 
              wheeled the dumb-waiter into the pantry. All this was done in a 
              perfect manner, and he never raised his eyes from what he was about. 
              Yet his very elbows, when he had his back towards me, seemed to 
              teem with the expression of his fixed opinion that I was extremely 
              young. </p>
            <p>　　'Can I do anything more, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him and said, No; but would he take no dinner himself? 
            </p>
            <p>　　'None, I am obliged to you, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford?' </p>
            <p>　　'I beg your pardon, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford?' </p>
            <p>　　'I should imagine that he might be here tomorrow, sir. I rather 
              thought he might have been here today, sir. The mistake is mine, 
              no doubt, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'If you should see him first -' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'If you'll excuse me, sir, I don't think I shall see him first.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'In case you do,' said I, 'pray say that I am sorry he was not 
              here today, as an old schoolfellow of his was here.' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed, sir!' and he divided a bow between me and Traddles, 
              with a glance at the latter. </p>
            <p>　　He was moving softly to the door, when, in a forlorn hope of 
              saying something naturally - which I never could, to this man - 
              I said: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! Littimer!' </p>
            <p>　　'Sir!' </p>
            <p>　　'Did you remain long at Yarmouth, that time?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not particularly so, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'You saw the boat completed?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, sir. I remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I know!' He raised his eyes to mine respectfully. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Steerforth has not seen it yet, I suppose?' </p>
            <p>　　'I really can't say, sir. I think - but I really can't say, sir. 
              I wish you good night, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　He comprehended everybody present, in the respectful bow with 
              which he followed these words, and disappeared. My visitors seemed 
              to breathe more freely when he was gone; but my own relief was very 
              great, for besides the constraint, arising from that extraordinary 
              sense of being at a disadvantage which I always had in this man's 
              presence, my conscience had embarrassed me with whispers that I 
              had mistrusted his master, and I could not repress a vague uneasy 
              dread that he might find it out. How was it, having so little in 
              reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding 
              me out? </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber roused me from this reflection, which was blended 
              with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing Steerforth himself, 
              by bestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable 
              fellow, and a thoroughly admirable servant. Mr. Micawber, I may 
              remark, had taken his full share of the general bow, and had received 
              it with infinite condescension. </p>
            <p>　　'But punch, my dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, tasting 
              it, 'like time and tide, waits for no man. Ah! it is at the present 
              moment in high flavour. My love, will you give me your opinion?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Micawber pronounced it excellent. </p>
            <p>　　'Then I will drink,' said Mr. Micawber, 'if my friend Copperfield 
              will permit me to take that social liberty, to the days when my 
              friend Copperfield and myself were younger, and fought our way in 
              the world side by side. I may say, of myself and Copperfield, in 
              words we have sung together before now, that </p>
            <p>　　 We twa hae run about the braes And pu'd the gowans' fine </p>
            <p>　　 - in a figurative point of view - on several occasions. I am 
              not exactly aware,' said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll in his 
              voice, and the old indescribable air of saying something genteel, 
              'what gowans may be, but I have no doubt that Copperfield and myself 
              would frequently have taken a pull at them, if it had been feasible.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, at the then present moment, took a pull at his 
              punch. So we all did: Traddles evidently lost in wondering at what 
              distant time Mr. Micawber and I could have been comrades in the 
              battle of the world. </p>
            <p>　　'Ahem!' said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat, and warming with 
              the punch and with the fire. 'My dear, another glass?' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Micawber said it must be very little; but we couldn't allow 
              that, so it was a glassful. </p>
            <p>　　'As we are quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. 
              Micawber, sipping her punch, 'Mr. Traddles being a part of our domesticity, 
              I should much like to have your opinion on Mr. Micawber's prospects. 
              For corn,' said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively, 'as I have repeatedly 
              said to Mr. Micawber, may be gentlemanly, but it is not remunerative. 
              Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight cannot, 
              however limited our ideas, be considered remunerative.' </p>
            <p>　　We were all agreed upon that. </p>
            <p>　　'Then,' said Mrs. Micawber, who prided herself on taking a clear 
              view of things, and keeping Mr. Micawber straight by her woman's 
              wisdom, when he might otherwise go a little crooked, 'then I ask 
              myself this question. If corn is not to be relied upon, what is? 
              Are coals to be relied upon? Not at all. We have turned our attention 
              to that experiment, on the suggestion of my family, and we find 
              it fallacious.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair with his hands in his 
              pockets, eyed us aside, and nodded his head, as much as to say that 
              the case was very clearly put. </p>
            <p>　　'The articles of corn and coals,' said Mrs. Micawber, still more 
              argumentatively, 'being equally out of the question, Mr. Copperfield, 
              I naturally look round the world, and say, &quot;What is there in 
              which a person of Mr. Micawber's talent is likely to succeed?&quot; 
              And I exclude the doing anything on commission, because commission 
              is not a certainty. What is best suited to a person of Mr. Micawber's 
              peculiar temperament is, I am convinced, a certainty.' </p>
            <p>　　Traddles and I both expressed, by a feeling murmur, that this 
              great discovery was no doubt true of Mr. Micawber, and that it did 
              him much credit. </p>
            <p>　　'I will not conceal from you, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' said 
              Mrs. Micawber, 'that I have long felt the Brewing business to be 
              particularly adapted to Mr. Micawber. Look at Barclay and Perkins! 
              Look at Truman, Hanbury, and Buxton! It is on that extensive footing 
              that Mr. Micawber, I know from my own knowledge of him, is calculated 
              to shine; and the profits, I am told, are e-NOR-MOUS! But if Mr. 
              Micawber cannot get into those firms - which decline to answer his 
              letters, when he offers his services even in an inferior capacity 
              - what is the use of dwelling upon that idea? None. I may have a 
              conviction that Mr. Micawber's manners -' </p>
            <p>　　'Hem! Really, my dear,' interposed Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'My love, be silent,' said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove 
              on his hand. 'I may have a conviction, Mr. Copperfield, that Mr. 
              Micawber's manners peculiarly qualify him for the Banking business. 
              I may argue within myself, that if I had a deposit at a banking-house, 
              the manners of Mr. Micawber, as representing that banking-house, 
              would inspire confidence, and must extend the connexion. But if 
              the various banking-houses refuse to avail themselves of Mr. Micawber's 
              abilities, or receive the offer of them with contumely, what is 
              the use of dwelling upon THAT idea? None. As to originating a banking-business, 
              I may know that there are members of my family who, if they chose 
              to place their money in Mr. Micawber's hands, might found an establishment 
              of that description. But if they do NOT choose to place their money 
              in Mr. Micawber's hands - which they don't - what is the use of 
              that? Again I contend that we are no farther advanced than we were 
              before.' </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head, and said, 'Not a bit.' Traddles also shook his 
              head, and said, 'Not a bit.' </p>
            <p>　　'What do I deduce from this?' Mrs. Micawber went on to say, still 
              with the same air of putting a case lucidly. 'What is the conclusion, 
              my dear Mr. Copperfield, to which I am irresistibly brought? Am 
              I wrong in saying, it is clear that we must live?' </p>
            <p>　　I answered 'Not at all!' and Traddles answered 'Not at all!' 
              and I found myself afterwards sagely adding, alone, that a person 
              must either live or die. </p>
            <p>　　'Just so,' returned Mrs. Micawber, 'It is precisely that. And 
              the fact is, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that we can not live without 
              something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning 
              up. Now I am convinced, myself, and this I have pointed out to Mr. 
              Micawber several times of late, that things cannot be expected to 
              turn up of themselves. We must, in a measure, assist to turn them 
              up. I may be wrong, but I have formed that opinion.' </p>
            <p>　　Both Traddles and I applauded it highly. </p>
            <p>　　'Very well,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'Then what do I recommend? Here 
              is Mr. Micawber with a variety of qualifications - with great talent 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'Really, my love,' said Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'Pray, my dear, allow me to conclude. Here is Mr. Micawber, with 
              a variety of qualifications, with great talent - I should say, with 
              genius, but that may be the partiality of a wife -' </p>
            <p>　　Traddles and I both murmured 'No.' </p>
            <p>　　'And here is Mr. Micawber without any suitable position or employment. 
              Where does that responsibility rest? Clearly on society. Then I 
              would make a fact so disgraceful known, and boldly challenge society 
              to set it right. It appears to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' said 
              Mrs. Micawber, forcibly, 'that what Mr. Micawber has to do, is to 
              throw down the gauntlet to society, and say, in effect, &quot;Show 
              me who will take that up. Let the party immediately step forward.&quot;' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I ventured to ask Mrs. Micawber how this was to be done. </p>
            <p>　　'By advertising,' said Mrs. Micawber - 'in all the papers. It 
              appears to me, that what Mr. Micawber has to do, in justice to himself, 
              in justice to his family, and I will even go so far as to say in 
              justice to society, by which he has been hitherto overlooked, is 
              to advertise in all the papers; to describe himself plainly as so-and-so, 
              with such and such qualifications and to put it thus: &quot;Now 
              employ me, on remunerative terms, and address, post-paid, to W. 
              M., Post Office, Camden Town.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'This idea of Mrs. Micawber's, my dear Copperfield,' said Mr. 
              Micawber, making his shirt-collar meet in front of his chin, and 
              glancing at me sideways, 'is, in fact, the Leap to which I alluded, 
              when I last had the pleasure of seeing you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Advertising is rather expensive,' I remarked, dubiously. </p>
            <p>　　'Exactly so!' said Mrs. Micawber, preserving the same logical 
              air. 'Quite true, my dear Mr. Copperfield! I have made the identical 
              observation to Mr. Micawber. It is for that reason especially, that 
              I think Mr. Micawber ought (as I have already said, in justice to 
              himself, in justice to his family, and in justice to society) to 
              raise a certain sum of money - on a bill.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair, trifled with his eye-glass 
              and cast his eyes up at the ceiling; but I thought him observant 
              of Traddles, too, who was looking at the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'If no member of my family,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'is possessed 
              of sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that bill - I believe 
              there is a better business-term to express what I mean -' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling, suggested 
              'Discount.' </p>
            <p>　　'To discount that bill,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'then my opinion 
              is, that Mr. Micawber should go into the City, should take that 
              bill into the Money Market, and should dispose of it for what he 
              can get. If the individuals in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber 
              to sustain a great sacrifice, that is between themselves and their 
              consciences. I view it, steadily, as an investment. I recommend 
              Mr. Micawber, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to do the same; to regard 
              it as an investment which is sure of return, and to make up his 
              mind to any sacrifice.' </p>
            <p>　　I felt, but I am sure I don't know why, that this was self-denying 
              and devoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect. 
              Traddles, who took his tone from me, did likewise, still looking 
              at the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'I will not,' said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, and gathering 
              her scarf about her shoulders, preparatory to her withdrawal to 
              my bedroom: 'I will not protract these remarks on the subject of 
              Mr. Micawber's pecuniary affairs. At your fireside, my dear Mr. 
              Copperfield, and in the presence of Mr. Traddles, who, though not 
              so old a friend, is quite one of ourselves, I could not refrain 
              from making you acquainted with the course I advise Mr. Micawber 
              to take. I feel that the time is arrived when Mr. Micawber should 
              exert himself and - I will add - assert himself, and it appears 
              to me that these are the means. I am aware that I am merely a female, 
              and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent 
              to the discussion of such questions; still I must not forget that, 
              when I lived at home with my papa and mama, my papa was in the habit 
              of saying, &quot;Emma's form is fragile, but her grasp of a subject 
              is inferior to none.&quot; That my papa was too partial, I well 
              know; but that he was an observer of character in some degree, my 
              duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt.' </p>
            <p>　　With these words, and resisting our entreaties that she would 
              grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence, 
              Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom. And really I felt that she 
              was a noble woman - the sort of woman who might have been a Roman 
              matron, and done all manner of heroic things, in times of public 
              trouble. </p>
            <p>　　In the fervour of this impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber 
              on the treasure he possessed. So did Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended 
              his hand to each of us in succession, and then covered his face 
              with his pocket-handkerchief, which I think had more snuff upon 
              it than he was aware of. He then returned to the punch, in the highest 
              state of exhilaration. </p>
            <p>　　He was full of eloquence. He gave us to understand that in our 
              children we lived again, and that, under the pressure of pecuniary 
              difficulties, any accession to their number was doubly welcome. 
              He said that Mrs. Micawber had latterly had her doubts on this point, 
              but that he had dispelled them, and reassured her. As to her family, 
              they were totally unworthy of her, and their sentiments were utterly 
              indifferent to him, and they might - I quote his own expression 
              - go to the Devil. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on Traddles. He said 
              Traddles's was a character, to the steady virtues of which he (Mr. 
              Micawber) could lay no claim, but which, he thanked Heaven, he could 
              admire. He feelingly alluded to the young lady, unknown, whom Traddles 
              had honoured with his affection, and who had reciprocated that affection 
              by honouring and blessing Traddles with her affection. Mr. Micawber 
              pledged her. So did I. Traddles thanked us both, by saying, with 
              a simplicity and honesty I had sense enough to be quite charmed 
              with, 'I am very much obliged to you indeed. And I do assure you, 
              she's the dearest girl! -' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber took an early opportunity, after that, of hinting, 
              with the utmost delicacy and ceremony, at the state of MY affections. 
              Nothing but the serious assurance of his friend Copperfield to the 
              contrary, he observed, could deprive him of the impression that 
              his friend Copperfield loved and was beloved. After feeling very 
              hot and uncomfortable for some time, and after a good deal of blushing, 
              stammering, and denying, I said, having my glass in my hand, 'Well! 
              I would give them D.!' which so excited and gratified Mr. Micawber, 
              that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom, in order that 
              Mrs. Micawber might drink D., who drank it with enthusiasm, crying 
              from within, in a shrill voice, 'Hear, hear! My dear Mr. Copperfield, 
              I am delighted. Hear!' and tapping at the wall, by way of applause. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Our conversation, afterwards, took a more worldly turn; Mr. Micawber 
              telling us that he found Camden Town inconvenient, and that the 
              first thing he contemplated doing, when the advertisement should 
              have been the cause of something satisfactory turning up, was to 
              move. He mentioned a terrace at the western end of Oxford Street, 
              fronting Hyde Park, on which he had always had his eye, but which 
              he did not expect to attain immediately, as it would require a large 
              establishment. There would probably be an interval, he explained, 
              in which he should content himself with the upper part of a house, 
              over some respectable place of business - say in Piccadilly, - which 
              would be a cheerful situation for Mrs. Micawber; and where, by throwing 
              out a bow-window, or carrying up the roof another story, or making 
              some little alteration of that sort, they might live, comfortably 
              and reputably, for a few years. Whatever was reserved for him, he 
              expressly said, or wherever his abode might be, we might rely on 
              this - there would always be a room for Traddles, and a knife and 
              fork for me. We acknowledged his kindness; and he begged us to forgive 
              his having launched into these practical and business-like details, 
              and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new arrangements 
              in life. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Micawber, tapping at the wall again to know if tea were 
              ready, broke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation. 
              She made tea for us in a most agreeable manner; and, whenever I 
              went near her, in handing about the tea-cups and bread-and-butter, 
              asked me, in a whisper, whether D. was fair, or dark, or whether 
              she was short, or tall: or something of that kind; which I think 
              I liked. After tea, we discussed a variety of topics before the 
              fire; and Mrs. Micawber was good enough to sing us (in a small, 
              thin, flat voice, which I remembered to have considered, when I 
              first knew her, the very table-beer of acoustics) the favourite 
              ballads of 'The Dashing White Sergeant', and 'Little Tafflin'. For 
              both of these songs Mrs. Micawber had been famous when she lived 
              at home with her papa and mama. Mr. Micawber told us, that when 
              he heard her sing the first one, on the first occasion of his seeing 
              her beneath the parental roof, she had attracted his attention in 
              an extraordinary degree; but that when it came to Little Tafflin, 
              he had resolved to win that woman or perish in the attempt. </p>
            <p>　　It was between ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose 
              to replace her cap in the whitey-brown paper parcel, and to put 
              on her bonnet. Mr. Micawber took the opportunity of Traddles putting 
              on his great-coat, to slip a letter into my hand, with a whispered 
              request that I would read it at my leisure. I also took the opportunity 
              of my holding a candle over the banisters to light them down, when 
              Mr. Micawber was going first, leading Mrs. Micawber, and Traddles 
              was following with the cap, to detain Traddles for a moment on the 
              top of the stairs. </p>
            <p>　　'Traddles,' said I, 'Mr. Micawber don't mean any harm, poor fellow: 
              but, if I were you, I wouldn't lend him anything.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' returned Traddles, smiling, 'I haven't 
              got anything to lend.' </p>
            <p>　　'You have got a name, you know,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! You call THAT something to lend?' returned Traddles, with 
              a thoughtful look. </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said Traddles. 'Yes, to be sure! I am very much obliged 
              to you, Copperfield; but - I am afraid I have lent him that already.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'For the bill that is to be a certain investment?' I inquired. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said Traddles. 'Not for that one. This is the first I have 
              heard of that one. I have been thinking that he will most likely 
              propose that one, on the way home. Mine's another.' </p>
            <p>　　'I hope there will be nothing wrong about it,' said I. 'I hope 
              not,' said Traddles. 'I should think not, though, because he told 
              me, only the other day, that it was provided for. That was Mr. Micawber's 
              expression, &quot;Provided for.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing, 
              I had only time to repeat my caution. Traddles thanked me, and descended. 
              But I was much afraid, when I observed the good-natured manner in 
              which he went down with the cap in his hand, and gave Mrs. Micawber 
              his arm, that he would be carried into the Money Market neck and 
              heels. </p>
            <p>　　I returned to my fireside, and was musing, half gravely and half 
              laughing, on the character of Mr. Micawber and the old relations 
              between us, when I heard a quick step ascending the stairs. At first, 
              I thought it was Traddles coming back for something Mrs. Micawber 
              had left behind; but as the step approached, I knew it, and felt 
              my heart beat high, and the blood rush to my face, for it was Steerforth's. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I was never unmindful of Agnes, and she never left that sanctuary 
              in my thoughts - if I may call it so - where I had placed her from 
              the first. But when he entered, and stood before me with his hand 
              out, the darkness that had fallen on him changed to light, and I 
              felt confounded and ashamed of having doubted one I loved so heartily. 
              I loved her none the less; I thought of her as the same benignant, 
              gentle angel in my life; I reproached myself, not her, with having 
              done him an injury; and I would have made him any atonement if I 
              had known what to make, and how to make it. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Daisy, old boy, dumb-foundered!' laughed Steerforth, shaking 
              my hand heartily, and throwing it gaily away. 'Have I detected you 
              in another feast, you Sybarite! These Doctors' Commons fellows are 
              the gayest men in town, I believe, and beat us sober Oxford people 
              all to nothing!' His bright glance went merrily round the room, 
              as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me, which Mrs. Micawber 
              had recently vacated, and stirred the fire into a blaze. </p>
            <p>　　'I was so surprised at first,' said I, giving him welcome with 
              all the cordiality I felt, 'that I had hardly breath to greet you 
              with, Steerforth.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, the sight of me is good for sore eyes, as the Scotch say,' 
              replied Steerforth, 'and so is the sight of you, Daisy, in full 
              bloom. How are you, my Bacchanal?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am very well,' said I; 'and not at all Bacchanalian tonight, 
              though I confess to another party of three.' </p>
            <p>　　'All of whom I met in the street, talking loud in your praise,' 
              returned Steerforth. 'Who's our friend in the tights?' </p>
            <p>　　I gave him the best idea I could, in a few words, of Mr. Micawber. 
              He laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman, and 
              said he was a man to know, and he must know him. 'But who do you 
              suppose our other friend is?' said I, in my turn. </p>
            <p>　　'Heaven knows,' said Steerforth. 'Not a bore, I hope? I thought 
              he looked a little like one.' </p>
            <p>　　'Traddles!' I replied, triumphantly. </p>
            <p>　　'Who's he?' asked Steerforth, in his careless way. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you remember Traddles? Traddles in our room at Salem House?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! That fellow!' said Steerforth, beating a lump of coal on 
              the top of the fire, with the poker. 'Is he as soft as ever? And 
              where the deuce did you pick him up?' </p>
            <p>　　I extolled Traddles in reply, as highly as I could; for I felt 
              that Steerforth rather slighted him. Steerforth, dismissing the 
              subject with a light nod, and a smile, and the remark that he would 
              be glad to see the old fellow too, for he had always been an odd 
              fish, inquired if I could give him anything to eat? During most 
              of this short dialogue, when he had not been speaking in a wild 
              vivacious manner, he had sat idly beating on the lump of coal with 
              the poker. I observed that he did the same thing while I was getting 
              out the remains of the pigeon-pie, and so forth. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Daisy, here's a supper for a king!' he exclaimed, starting 
              out of his silence with a burst, and taking his seat at the table. 
              'I shall do it justice, for I have come from Yarmouth.' </p>
            <p>　　'I thought you came from Oxford?' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Not I,' said Steerforth. 'I have been seafaring - better employed.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Littimer was here today, to inquire for you,' I remarked, 'and 
              I understood him that you were at Oxford; though, now I think of 
              it, he certainly did not say so.' </p>
            <p>　　'Littimer is a greater fool than I thought him, to have been 
              inquiring for me at all,' said Steerforth, jovially pouring out 
              a glass of wine, and drinking to me. 'As to understanding him, you 
              are a cleverer fellow than most of us, Daisy, if you can do that.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'That's true, indeed,' said I, moving my chair to the table. 
              'So you have been at Yarmouth, Steerforth!' interested to know all 
              about it. 'Have you been there long?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' he returned. 'An escapade of a week or so.' </p>
            <p>　　'And how are they all? Of course, little Emily is not married 
              yet?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not yet. Going to be, I believe - in so many weeks, or months, 
              or something or other. I have not seen much of 'em. By the by'; 
              he laid down his knife and fork, which he had been using with great 
              diligence, and began feeling in his pockets; 'I have a letter for 
              you.' </p>
            <p>　　'From whom?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, from your old nurse,' he returned, taking some papers out 
              of his breast pocket. &quot;'J. Steerforth, Esquire, debtor, to 
              The Willing Mind&quot;; that's not it. Patience, and we'll find 
              it presently. Old what's-his-name's in a bad way, and it's about 
              that, I believe.' </p>
            <p>　　'Barkis, do you mean?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes!' still feeling in his pockets, and looking over their contents: 
              'it's all over with poor Barkis, I am afraid. I saw a little apothecary 
              there - surgeon, or whatever he is - who brought your worship into 
              the world. He was mighty learned about the case, to me; but the 
              upshot of his opinion was, that the carrier was making his last 
              journey rather fast. - Put your hand into the breast pocket of my 
              great-coat on the chair yonder, and I think you'll find the letter. 
              Is it there?' </p>
            <p>　　'Here it is!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'That's right!' </p>
            <p>　　It was from Peggotty; something less legible than usual, and 
              brief. It informed me of her husband's hopeless state, and hinted 
              at his being 'a little nearer' than heretofore, and consequently 
              more difficult to manage for his own comfort. It said nothing of 
              her weariness and watching, and praised him highly. It was written 
              with a plain, unaffected, homely piety that I knew to be genuine, 
              and ended with 'my duty to my ever darling' - meaning myself. </p>
            <p>　　While I deciphered it, Steerforth continued to eat and drink. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'It's a bad job,' he said, when I had done; 'but the sun sets 
              every day, and people die every minute, and we mustn't be scared 
              by the common lot. If we failed to hold our own, because that equal 
              foot at all men's doors was heard knocking somewhere, every object 
              in this world would slip from us. No! Ride on! Rough-shod if need 
              be, smooth-shod if that will do, but ride on! Ride on over all obstacles, 
              and win the race!' </p>
            <p>　　'And win what race?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'The race that one has started in,' said he. 'Ride on!' </p>
            <p>　　I noticed, I remember, as he paused, looking at me with his handsome 
              head a little thrown back, and his glass raised in his hand, that, 
              though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face, and it was 
              ruddy, there were traces in it, made since I last saw it, as if 
              he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy 
              which, when roused, was so passionately roused within him. I had 
              it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way 
              of pursuing any fancy that he took - such as this buffeting of rough 
              seas, and braving of hard weather, for example - when my mind glanced 
              off to the immediate subject of our conversation again, and pursued 
              that instead. </p>
            <p>　　'I tell you what, Steerforth,' said I, 'if your high spirits 
              will listen to me -' </p>
            <p>　　'They are potent spirits, and will do whatever you like,' he 
              answered, moving from the table to the fireside again. </p>
            <p>　　'Then I tell you what, Steerforth. I think I will go down and 
              see my old nurse. It is not that I can do her any good, or render 
              her any real service; but she is so attached to me that my visit 
              will have as much effect on her, as if I could do both. She will 
              take it so kindly that it will be a comfort and support to her. 
              It is no great effort to make, I am sure, for such a friend as she 
              has been to me. Wouldn't you go a day's journey, if you were in 
              my place?' </p>
            <p>　　His face was thoughtful, and he sat considering a little before 
              he answered, in a low voice, 'Well! Go. You can do no harm.' </p>
            <p>　　'You have just come back,' said I, 'and it would be in vain to 
              ask you to go with me?' </p>
            <p>　　'Quite,' he returned. 'I am for Highgate tonight. I have not 
              seen my mother this long time, and it lies upon my conscience, for 
              it's something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son. - Bah! 
              Nonsense! - You mean to go tomorrow, I suppose?' he said, holding 
              me out at arm's length, with a hand on each of my shoulders. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I think so.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, then, don't go till next day. I wanted you to come and 
              stay a few days with us. Here I am, on purpose to bid you, and you 
              fly off to Yarmouth!' </p>
            <p>　　'You are a nice fellow to talk of flying off, Steerforth, who 
              are always running wild on some unknown expedition or other!' </p>
            <p>　　He looked at me for a moment without speaking, and then rejoined, 
              still holding me as before, and giving me a shake: </p>
            <p>　　'Come! Say the next day, and pass as much of tomorrow as you 
              can with us! Who knows when we may meet again, else? Come! Say the 
              next day! I want you to stand between Rosa Dartle and me, and keep 
              us asunder.' </p>
            <p>　　'Would you love each other too much, without me?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes; or hate,' laughed Steerforth; 'no matter which. Come! Say 
              the next day!' </p>
            <p>　　I said the next day; and he put on his great-coat and lighted 
              his cigar, and set off to walk home. Finding him in this intention, 
              I put on my own great-coat (but did not light my own cigar, having 
              had enough of that for one while) and walked with him as far as 
              the open road: a dull road, then, at night. He was in great spirits 
              all the way; and when we parted, and I looked after him going so 
              gallantly and airily homeward, I thought of his saying, 'Ride on 
              over all obstacles, and win the race!' and wished, for the first 
              time, that he had some worthy race to run. </p>
            <p>　　I was undressing in my own room, when Mr. Micawber's letter tumbled 
              on the floor. Thus reminded of it, I broke the seal and read as 
              follows. It was dated an hour and a half before dinner. I am not 
              sure whether I have mentioned that, when Mr. Micawber was at any 
              particularly desperate crisis, he used a sort of legal phraseology, 
              which he seemed to think equivalent to winding up his affairs. </p>
            <p>　　 'SIR - for I dare not say my dear Copperfield, </p>
            <p>　　'It is expedient that I should inform you that the undersigned 
              is Crushed. Some flickering efforts to spare you the premature knowledge 
              of his calamitous position, you may observe in him this day; but 
              hope has sunk beneath the horizon, and the undersigned is Crushed.

              is in legal possession of the premises, under a distress for rent. 
              His inventory includes, not only the chattels and effects of every 
              description belonging to the undersigned, as yearly tenant of this

              a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned, by the before-mentioned

              may be looked for - in round numbers - at the expiration of a period

              daughter, who was one of ten, down in Devonshire, and who was such 
              a dear girl, and who would wait for Traddles (ominous praise!) until 
              she was sixty, or any age that could be mentioned. </p>

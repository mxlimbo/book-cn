            <p>　　 My aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable 
              by my prolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that 
              I should go to Dover, to see that all was working well at the cottage, 
              which was let; and to conclude an agreement, with the same tenant, 
              for a longer term of occupation. Janet was drafted into the service 
              of Mrs. Strong, where I saw her every day. She had been undecided, 
              on leaving Dover, whether or no to give the finishing touch to that 
              renunciation of mankind in which she had been educated, by marrying 
              a pilot; but she decided against that venture. Not so much for the 
              sake of principle, I believe, as because she happened not to like 
              him. </p>
            <p>　　Although it required an effort to leave Miss Mills, I fell rather 
              willingly into my aunt's pretence, as a means of enabling me to 
              pass a few tranquil hours with Agnes. I consulted the good Doctor 
              relative to an absence of three days; and the Doctor wishing me 
              to take that relaxation, - he wished me to take more; but my energy 
              could not bear that, - I made up my mind to go. </p>
            <p>　　As to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about 
              my duties in that quarter. To say the truth, we were getting in 
              no very good odour among the tip-top proctors, and were rapidly 
              sliding down to but a doubtful position. The business had been indifferent 
              under Mr. jorkins, before Mr. Spenlow's time; and although it had 
              been quickened by the infusion of new blood, and by the display 
              which Mr. Spenlow made, still it was not established on a sufficiently 
              strong basis to bear, without being shaken, such a blow as the sudden 
              loss of its active manager. It fell off very much. Mr. jorkins, 
              notwithstanding his reputation in the firm, was an easy-going, incapable 
              sort of man, whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to 
              back it up. I was turned over to him now, and when I saw him take 
              his snuff and let the business go, I regretted my aunt's thousand 
              pounds more than ever. </p>
            <p>　　But this was not the worst of it. There were a number of hangers-on 
              and outsiders about the Commons, who, without being proctors themselves, 
              dabbled in common-form business, and got it done by real proctors, 
              who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoil; - 
              and there were a good many of these too. As our house now wanted 
              business on any terms, we joined this noble band; and threw out 
              lures to the hangers-on and outsiders, to bring their business to 
              us. Marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked 
              for, and what paid us best; and the competition for these ran very 
              high indeed. Kidnappers and inveiglers were planted in all the avenues 
              of entrance to the Commons, with instructions to do their utmost 
              to cut off all persons in mourning, and all gentlemen with anything 
              bashful in their appearance, and entice them to the offices in which 
              their respective employers were interested; which instructions were 
              so well observed, that I myself, before I was known by sight, was 
              twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent. The conflicting 
              interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to irritate 
              their feelings, personal collisions took place; and the Commons 
              was even scandalized by our principal inveigler (who had formerly 
              been in the wine trade, and afterwards in the sworn brokery line) 
              walking about for some days with a black eye. Any one of these scouts 
              used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black 
              out of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for, representing 
              his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that 
              proctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected) 
              to his employer's office. Many captives were brought to me in this 
              way. As to marriage licences, the competition rose to such a pitch, 
              that a shy gentleman in want of one, had nothing to do but submit 
              himself to the first inveigler, or be fought for, and become the 
              prey of the strongest. One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, 
              in the height of this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might 
              be ready to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who 
              was brought in. The system of inveigling continues, I believe, to 
              this day. The last time I was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied 
              person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway, and 
              whispering the word 'Marriage-licence' in my ear, was with great 
              difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me 
              into a proctor's. From this digression, let me proceed to Dover. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and 
              was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the 
              tenant inherited her feud, and waged incessant war against donkeys. 
              Having settled the little business I had to transact there, and 
              slept there one night, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning. 
              It was now winter again; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the 
              sweeping downland, brightened up my hopes a little. </p>
            <p>　　Coming into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with 
              a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits, and eased my heart. There 
              were the old signs, the old names over the shops, the old people 
              serving in them. It appeared so long, since I had been a schoolboy 
              there, that I wondered the place was so little changed, until I 
              reflected how little I was changed myself. Strange to say, that 
              quiet influence which was inseparable in my mind from Agnes, seemed 
              to pervade even the city where she dwelt. The venerable cathedral 
              towers, and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them 
              more retired than perfect silence would have done; the battered 
              gateways, one stuck full with statues, long thrown down, and crumbled 
              away, like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them; the 
              still nooks, where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled 
              ends and ruined walls; the ancient houses, the pastoral landscape 
              of field, orchard, and garden; everywhere - on everything - I felt 
              the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful, softening spirit. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Arrived at Mr. Wickfield's house, I found, in the little lower 
              room on the ground floor, where Uriah Heep had been of old accustomed 
              to sit, Mr. Micawber plying his pen with great assiduity. He was 
              dressed in a legal-looking suit of black, and loomed, burly and 
              large, in that small office. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber was extremely glad to see me, but a little confused 
              too. He would have conducted me immediately into the presence of 
              Uriah, but I declined. </p>
            <p>　　'I know the house of old, you recollect,' said I, 'and will find 
              my way upstairs. How do you like the law, Mr. Micawber?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' he replied. 'To a man possessed of the 
              higher imaginative powers, the objection to legal studies is the 
              amount of detail which they involve. Even in our professional correspondence,' 
              said Mr. Micawber, glancing at some letters he was writing, 'the 
              mind is not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression. 
              Still, it is a great pursuit. A great pursuit!' </p>
            <p>　　He then told me that he had become the tenant of Uriah Heep's 
              old house; and that Mrs. Micawber would be delighted to receive 
              me, once more, under her own roof. </p>
            <p>　　'It is humble,' said Mr. Micawber, '- to quote a favourite expression 
              of my friend Heep; but it may prove the stepping-stone to more ambitious 
              domiciliary accommodation.' </p>
            <p>　　I asked him whether he had reason, so far, to be satisfied with 
              his friend Heep's treatment of him? He got up to ascertain if the 
              door were close shut, before he replied, in a lower voice: </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield, a man who labours under the pressure of 
              pecuniary embarrassments, is, with the generality of people, at 
              a disadvantage. That disadvantage is not diminished, when that pressure 
              necessitates the drawing of stipendiary emoluments, before those 
              emoluments are strictly due and payable. All I can say is, that 
              my friend Heep has responded to appeals to which I need not more 
              particularly refer, in a manner calculated to redound equally to 
              the honour of his head, and of his heart.' </p>
            <p>　　'I should not have supposed him to be very free with his money 
              either,' I observed. </p>
            <p>　　'Pardon me!' said Mr. Micawber, with an air of constraint, 'I 
              speak of my friend Heep as I have experience.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am glad your experience is so favourable,' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'You are very obliging, my dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber; 
              and hummed a tune. </p>
            <p>　　'Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield?' I asked, to change the subject. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not much,' said Mr. Micawber, slightingly. 'Mr. Wickfield is, 
              I dare say, a man of very excellent intentions; but he is - in short, 
              he is obsolete.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield!' returned Mr. Micawber, after some uneasy 
              evolutions on his stool, 'allow me to offer a remark! I am here, 
              in a capacity of confidence. I am here, in a position of trust. 
              The discussion of some topics, even with Mrs. Micawber herself (so 
              long the partner of my various vicissitudes, and a woman of a remarkable 
              lucidity of intellect), is, I am led to consider, incompatible with 
              the functions now devolving on me. I would therefore take the liberty 
              of suggesting that in our friendly intercourse - which I trust will 
              never be disturbed! - we draw a line. On one side of this line,' 
              said Mr. Micawber, representing it on the desk with the office ruler, 
              'is the whole range of the human intellect, with a trifling exception; 
              on the other, IS that exception; that is to say, the affairs of 
              Messrs Wickfield and Heep, with all belonging and appertaining thereunto. 
              I trust I give no offence to the companion of my youth, in submitting 
              this proposition to his cooler judgement?' </p>
            <p>　　Though I saw an uneasy change in Mr. Micawber, which sat tightly 
              on him, as if his new duties were a misfit, I felt I had no right 
              to be offended. My telling him so, appeared to relieve him; and 
              he shook hands with me. </p>
            <p>　　'I am charmed, Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'let me assure 
              you, with Miss Wickfield. She is a very superior young lady, of 
              very remarkable attractions, graces, and virtues. Upon my honour,' 
              said Mr. Micawber, indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with 
              his genteelest air, 'I do Homage to Miss Wickfield! Hem!' 'I am 
              glad of that, at least,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'If you had not assured us, my dear Copperfield, on the occasion 
              of that agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with 
              you, that D. was your favourite letter,' said Mr. Micawber, 'I should 
              unquestionably have supposed that A. had been so.' </p>
            <p>　　We have all some experience of a feeling, that comes over us 
              occasionally, of what we are saying and doing having been said and 
              done before, in a remote time - of our having been surrounded, dim 
              ages ago, by the same faces, objects, and circumstances - of our 
              knowing perfectly what will be said next, as if we suddenly remembered 
              it! I never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life, 
              than before he uttered those words. </p>
            <p>　　I took my leave of Mr. Micawber, for the time, charging him with 
              my best remembrances to all at home. As I left him, resuming his 
              stool and his pen, and rolling his head in his stock, to get it 
              into easier writing order, I clearly perceived that there was something 
              interposed between him and me, since he had come into his new functions, 
              which prevented our getting at each other as we used to do, and 
              quite altered the character of our intercourse. </p>
            <p>　　There was no one in the quaint old drawing-room, though it presented 
              tokens of Mrs. Heep's whereabouts. I looked into the room still 
              belonging to Agnes, and saw her sitting by the fire, at a pretty 
              old-fashioned desk she had, writing. </p>
            <p>　　My darkening the light made her look up. What a pleasure to be 
              the cause of that bright change in her attentive face, and the object 
              of that sweet regard and welcome! </p>
            <p>　　'Ah, Agnes!' said I, when we were sitting together, side by side; 
              'I have missed you so much, lately!' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed?' she replied. 'Again! And so soon?' </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head. </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know how it is, Agnes; I seem to want some faculty of 
              mind that I ought to have. You were so much in the habit of thinking 
              for me, in the happy old days here, and I came so naturally to you 
              for counsel and support, that I really think I have missed acquiring 
              it.' </p>
            <p>　　'And what is it?' said Agnes, cheerfully. </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know what to call it,' I replied. 'I think I am earnest 
              and persevering?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure of it,' said Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　'And patient, Agnes?' I inquired, with a little hesitation. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' returned Agnes, laughing. 'Pretty well.' </p>
            <p>　　'And yet,' said I, 'I get so miserable and worried, and am so 
              unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself, that I know 
              I must want - shall I call it - reliance, of some kind?' </p>
            <p>　　'Call it so, if you will,' said Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　'Well!' I returned. 'See here! You come to London, I rely on 
              you, and I have an object and a course at once. I am driven out 
              of it, I come here, and in a moment I feel an altered person. The 
              circumstances that distressed me are not changed, since I came into 
              this room; but an influence comes over me in that short interval 
              that alters me, oh, how much for the better! What is it? What is 
              your secret, Agnes?' </p>
            <p>　　Her head was bent down, looking at the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'It's the old story,' said I. 'Don't laugh, when I say it was 
              always the same in little things as it is in greater ones. My old 
              troubles were nonsense, and now they are serious; but whenever I 
              have gone away from my adopted sister -' </p>
            <p>　　Agnes looked up - with such a Heavenly face! - and gave me her 
              hand, which I kissed. </p>
            <p>　　'Whenever I have not had you, Agnes, to advise and approve in 
              the beginning, I have seemed to go wild, and to get into all sorts 
              of difficulty. When I have come to you, at last (as I have always 
              done), I have come to peace and happiness. I come home, now, like 
              a tired traveller, and find such a blessed sense of rest!' </p>
            <p>　　I felt so deeply what I said, it affected me so sincerely, that 
              my voice failed, and I covered my face with my hand, and broke into 
              tears. I write the truth. Whatever contradictions and inconsistencies 
              there were within me, as there are within so many of us; whatever 
              might have been so different, and so much better; whatever I had 
              done, in which I had perversely wandered away from the voice of 
              my own heart; I knew nothing of. I only knew that I was fervently 
              in earnest, when I felt the rest and peace of having Agnes near 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　In her placid sisterly manner; with her beaming eyes; with her 
              tender voice; and with that sweet composure, which had long ago 
              made the house that held her quite a sacred place to me; she soon 
              won me from this weakness, and led me on to tell all that had happened 
              since our last meeting. </p>
            <p>　　'And there is not another word to tell, Agnes,' said I, when 
              I had made an end of my confidence. 'Now, my reliance is on you.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'But it must not be on me, Trotwood,' returned Agnes, with a 
              pleasant smile. 'It must be on someone else.' </p>
            <p>　　'On Dora?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Assuredly.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, I have not mentioned, Agnes,' said I, a little embarrassed, 
              'that Dora is rather difficult to - I would not, for the world, 
              say, to rely upon, because she is the soul of purity and truth - 
              but rather difficult to - I hardly know how to express it, really, 
              Agnes. She is a timid little thing, and easily disturbed and frightened. 
              Some time ago, before her father's death, when I thought it right 
              to mention to her - but I'll tell you, if you will bear with me, 
              how it was.' </p>
            <p>　　Accordingly, I told Agnes about my declaration of poverty, about 
              the cookery-book, the housekeeping accounts, and all the rest of 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Trotwood!' she remonstrated, with a smile. 'Just your old 
              headlong way! You might have been in earnest in striving to get 
              on in the world, without being so very sudden with a timid, loving, 
              inexperienced girl. Poor Dora!' </p>
            <p>　　I never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in a voice, 
              as she expressed in making this reply. It was as if I had seen her 
              admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, 
              by her considerate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that 
              little heart. It was as if I had seen Dora, in all her fascinating 
              artlessness, caressing Agnes, and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing 
              against me, and loving me with all her childish innocence. </p>
            <p>　　I felt so grateful to Agnes, and admired her so! I saw those 
              two together, in a bright perspective, such well-associated friends, 
              each adorning the other so much! </p>
            <p>　　'What ought I to do then, Agnes?' I inquired, after looking at 
              the fire a little while. 'What would it be right to do?' </p>
            <p>　　'I think,' said Agnes, 'that the honourable course to take, would 
              be to write to those two ladies. Don't you think that any secret 
              course is an unworthy one?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes. If YOU think so,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters,' replied Agnes, 
              with a modest hesitation, 'but I certainly feel - in short, I feel 
              that your being secret and clandestine, is not being like yourself.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Like myself, in the too high opinion you have of me, Agnes, 
              I am afraid,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Like yourself, in the candour of your nature,' she returned; 
              'and therefore I would write to those two ladies. I would relate, 
              as plainly and as openly as possible, all that has taken place; 
              and I would ask their permission to visit sometimes, at their house. 
              Considering that you are young, and striving for a place in life, 
              I think it would be well to say that you would readily abide by 
              any conditions they might impose upon you. I would entreat them 
              not to dismiss your request, without a reference to Dora; and to 
              discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable. I 
              would not be too vehement,' said Agnes, gently, 'or propose too 
              much. I would trust to my fidelity and perseverance - and to Dora.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'But if they were to frighten Dora again, Agnes, by speaking 
              to her,' said I. 'And if Dora were to cry, and say nothing about 
              me!' </p>
            <p>　　'Is that likely?' inquired Agnes, with the same sweet consideration 
              in her face. </p>
            <p>　　'God bless her, she is as easily scared as a bird,' said I. 'It 
              might be! Or if the two Miss Spenlows (elderly ladies of that sort 
              are odd characters sometimes) should not be likely persons to address 
              in that way!' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't think, Trotwood,' returned Agnes, raising her soft eyes 
              to mine, 'I would consider that. Perhaps it would be better only 
              to consider whether it is right to do this; and, if it is, to do 
              it.' </p>
            <p>　　I had no longer any doubt on the subject. With a lightened heart, 
              though with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task, 
              I devoted the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of 
              this letter; for which great purpose, Agnes relinquished her desk 
              to me. But first I went downstairs to see Mr. Wickfield and Uriah 
              Heep. </p>
            <p>　　I found Uriah in possession of a new, plaster-smelling office, 
              built out in the garden; looking extraordinarily mean, in the midst 
              of a quantity of books and papers. He received me in his usual fawning 
              way, and pretended not to have heard of my arrival from Mr. Micawber; 
              a pretence I took the liberty of disbelieving. He accompanied me 
              into Mr. Wickfield's room, which was the shadow of its former self 
              - having been divested of a variety of conveniences, for the accommodation 
              of the new partner - and stood before the fire, warming his back, 
              and shaving his chin with his bony hand, while Mr. Wickfield and 
              I exchanged greetings. </p>
            <p>　　'You stay with us, Trotwood, while you remain in Canterbury?' 
              said Mr. Wickfield, not without a glance at Uriah for his approval. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Is there room for me?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I am sure, Master Copperfield - I should say Mister, but the 
              other comes so natural,' said Uriah, -'I would turn out of your 
              old room with pleasure, if it would be agreeable.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Why should you be inconvenienced? 
              There's another room. There's another room.' 'Oh, but you know,' 
              returned Uriah, with a grin, 'I should really be delighted!' </p>
            <p>　　To cut the matter short, I said I would have the other room or 
              none at all; so it was settled that I should have the other room; 
              and, taking my leave of the firm until dinner, I went upstairs again. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I had hoped to have no other companion than Agnes. But Mrs. Heep 
              had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the 
              fire, in that room; on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable 
              for her rheumatics, as the wind then was, than the drawing-room 
              or dining-parlour. Though I could almost have consigned her to the 
              mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral, without 
              remorse, I made a virtue of necessity, and gave her a friendly salutation. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I'm umbly thankful to you, sir,' said Mrs. Heep, in acknowledgement 
              of my inquiries concerning her health, 'but I'm only pretty well. 
              I haven't much to boast of. If I could see my Uriah well settled 
              in life, I couldn't expect much more I think. How do you think my 
              Ury looking, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　I thought him looking as villainous as ever, and I replied that 
              I saw no change in him. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, don't you think he's changed?' said Mrs. Heep. 'There I 
              must umbly beg leave to differ from you. Don't you see a thinness 
              in him?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not more than usual,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you though!' said Mrs. Heep. 'But you don't take notice 
              of him with a mother's eye!' </p>
            <p>　　His mother's eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world, I 
              thought as it met mine, howsoever affectionate to him; and I believe 
              she and her son were devoted to one another. It passed me, and went 
              on to Agnes. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't YOU see a wasting and a wearing in him, Miss Wickfield?' 
              inquired Mrs. Heep. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said Agnes, quietly pursuing the work on which she was 
              engaged. 'You are too solicitous about him. He is very well.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Heep, with a prodigious sniff, resumed her knitting. </p>
            <p>　　She never left off, or left us for a moment. I had arrived early 
              in the day, and we had still three or four hours before dinner; 
              but she sat there, plying her knitting-needles as monotonously as 
              an hour-glass might have poured out its sands. She sat on one side 
              of the fire; I sat at the desk in front of it; a little beyond me, 
              on the other side, sat Agnes. Whensoever, slowly pondering over 
              my letter, I lifted up my eyes, and meeting the thoughtful face 
              of Agnes, saw it clear, and beam encouragement upon me, with its 
              own angelic expression, I was conscious presently of the evil eye 
              passing me, and going on to her, and coming back to me again, and 
              dropping furtively upon the knitting. What the knitting was, I don't 
              know, not being learned in that art; but it looked like a net; and 
              as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of knitting-needles, 
              she showed in the firelight like an ill-looking enchantress, baulked 
              as yet by the radiant goodness opposite, but getting ready for a 
              cast of her net by and by. </p>
            <p>　　At dinner she maintained her watch, with the same unwinking eyes. 
              After dinner, her son took his turn; and when Mr. Wickfield, himself, 
              and I were left alone together, leered at me, and writhed until 
              I could hardly bear it. In the drawing-room, there was the mother 
              knitting and watching again. All the time that Agnes sang and played, 
              the mother sat at the piano. Once she asked for a particular ballad, 
              which she said her Ury (who was yawning in a great chair) doted 
              on; and at intervals she looked round at him, and reported to Agnes 
              that he was in raptures with the music. But she hardly ever spoke 
              - I question if she ever did - without making some mention of him. 
              It was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her. </p>
            <p>　　This lasted until bedtime. To have seen the mother and son, like 
              two great bats hanging over the whole house, and darkening it with 
              their ugly forms, made me so uncomfortable, that I would rather 
              have remained downstairs, knitting and all, than gone to bed. I 
              hardly got any sleep. Next day the knitting and watching began again, 
              and lasted all day. </p>
            <p>　　I had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes, for ten minutes. 
              I could barely show her my letter. I proposed to her to walk out 
              with me; but Mrs. Heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse, 
              Agnes charitably remained within, to bear her company. Towards the 
              twilight I went out by myself, musing on what I ought to do, and 
              whether I was justified in withholding from Agnes, any longer, what 
              Uriah Heep had told me in London; for that began to trouble me again, 
              very much. </p>
            <p>　　I had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, 
              upon the Ramsgate road, where there was a good path, when I was 
              hailed, through the dust, by somebody behind me. The shambling figure, 
              and the scanty great-coat, were not to be mistaken. I stopped, and 
              Uriah Heep came up. </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'How fast you walk!' said he. 'My legs are pretty long, but you've 
              given 'em quite a job.' </p>
            <p>　　'Where are you going?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I am going with you, Master Copperfield, if you'll allow me 
              the pleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance.' Saying this, with 
              a jerk of his body, which might have been either propitiatory or 
              derisive, he fell into step beside me. </p>
            <p>　　'Uriah!' said I, as civilly as I could, after a silence. </p>
            <p>　　'Master Copperfield!' said Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　'To tell you the truth (at which you will not be offended), I 
              came Out to walk alone, because I have had so much company.' </p>
            <p>　　He looked at me sideways, and said with his hardest grin, 'You 
              mean mother.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why yes, I do,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! But you know we're so very umble,' he returned. 'And having 
              such a knowledge of our own umbleness, we must really take care 
              that we're not pushed to the wall by them as isn't umble. All stratagems 
              are fair in love, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　Raising his great hands until they touched his chin, he rubbed 
              them softly, and softly chuckled; looking as like a malevolent baboon, 
              I thought, as anything human could look. </p>
            <p>　　'You see,' he said, still hugging himself in that unpleasant 
              way, and shaking his head at me, 'you're quite a dangerous rival, 
              Master Copperfield. You always was, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you set a watch upon Miss Wickfield, and make her home no 
              home, because of me?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! Master Copperfield! Those are very arsh words,' he replied. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Put my meaning into any words you like,' said I. 'You know what 
              it is, Uriah, as well as I do.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh no! You must put it into words,' he said. 'Oh, really! I 
              couldn't myself.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you suppose,' said I, constraining myself to be very temperate 
              and quiet with him, on account of Agnes, 'that I regard Miss Wickfield 
              otherwise than as a very dear sister?' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Master Copperfield,' he replied, 'you perceive I am not 
              bound to answer that question. You may not, you know. But then, 
              you see, you may!' </p>
            <p>　　Anything to equal the low cunning of his visage, and of his shadowless 
              eyes without the ghost of an eyelash, I never saw. </p>
            <p>　　'Come then!' said I. 'For the sake of Miss Wickfield -' </p>
            <p>　　'My Agnes!' he exclaimed, with a sickly, angular contortion of 
              himself. 'Would you be so good as call her Agnes, Master Copperfield!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'For the sake of Agnes Wickfield - Heaven bless her!' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you for that blessing, Master Copperfield!'he interposed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I will tell you what I should, under any other circumstances, 
              as soon have thought of telling to - Jack Ketch.' </p>
            <p>　　'To who, sir?' said Uriah, stretching out his neck, and shading 
              his ear with his hand. </p>
            <p>　　'To the hangman,' I returned. 'The most unlikely person I could 
              think of,' - though his own face had suggested the allusion quite 
              as a natural sequence. 'I am engaged to another young lady. I hope 
              that contents you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Upon your soul?' said Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　I was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation 
              he required, when he caught hold of my hand, and gave it a squeeze. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Master Copperfield!' he said. 'If you had only had the condescension 
              to return my confidence when I poured out the fulness of my art, 
              the night I put you so much out of the way by sleeping before your 
              sitting-room fire, I never should have doubted you. As it is, I'm 
              sure I'll take off mother directly, and only too appy. I know you'll 
              excuse the precautions of affection, won't you? What a pity, Master 
              Copperfield, that you didn't condescend to return my confidence! 
              I'm sure I gave you every opportunity. But you never have condescended 
              to me, as much as I could have wished. I know you have never liked 
              me, as I have liked you!' </p>
            <p>　　All this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers, 
              while I made every effort I decently could to get it away. But I 
              was quite unsuccessful. He drew it under the sleeve of his mulberry-coloured 
              great-coat, and I walked on, almost upon compulsion, arm-in-arm 
              with him. </p>
            <p>　　'Shall we turn?' said Uriah, by and by wheeling me face about 
              towards the town, on which the early moon was now shining, silvering 
              the distant windows. </p>
            <p>　　'Before we leave the subject, you ought to understand,' said 
              I, breaking a pretty long silence, 'that I believe Agnes Wickfield 
              to be as far above you, and as far removed from all your aspirations, 
              as that moon herself!' </p>
            <p>　　'Peaceful! Ain't she!' said Uriah. 'Very! Now confess, Master 
              Copperfield, that you haven't liked me quite as I have liked you. 
              All along you've thought me too umble now, I shouldn't wonder?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am not fond of professions of humility,' I returned, 'or professions 
              of anything else.' 'There now!' said Uriah, looking flabby and lead-coloured 
              in the moonlight. 'Didn't I know it! But how little you think of 
              the rightful umbleness of a person in my station, Master Copperfield! 
              Father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys; 
              and mother, she was likewise brought up at a public, sort of charitable, 
              establishment. They taught us all a deal of umbleness - not much 
              else that I know of, from morning to night. We was to be umble to 
              this person, and umble to that; and to pull off our caps here, and 
              to make bows there; and always to know our place, and abase ourselves 
              before our betters. And we had such a lot of betters! Father got 
              the monitor-medal by being umble. So did I. Father got made a sexton 
              by being umble. He had the character, among the gentlefolks, of 
              being such a well-behaved man, that they were determined to bring 
              him in. &quot;Be umble, Uriah,&quot; says father to me, &quot;and 
              you'll get on. It was what was always being dinned into you and 
              me at school; it's what goes down best. Be umble,&quot; says father,&quot; 
              and you'll do!&quot; And really it ain't done bad!' </p>
            <p>　　It was the first time it had ever occurred to me, that this detestable 
              cant of false humility might have originated out of the Heep family. 
              I had seen the harvest, but had never thought of the seed. </p>
            <p>　　'When I was quite a young boy,' said Uriah, 'I got to know what 
              umbleness did, and I took to it. I ate umble pie with an appetite. 
              I stopped at the umble point of my learning, and says I, &quot;Hold 
              hard!&quot; When you offered to teach me Latin, I knew better. &quot;People 
              like to be above you,&quot; says father, &quot;keep yourself down.&quot; 
              I am very umble to the present moment, Master Copperfield, but I've 
              got a little power!' </p>
            <p>　　And he said all this - I knew, as I saw his face in the moonlight 
              - that I might understand he was resolved to recompense himself 
              by using his power. I had never doubted his meanness, his craft 
              and malice; but I fully comprehended now, for the first time, what 
              a base, unrelenting, and revengeful spirit, must have been engendered 
              by this early, and this long, suppression. </p>
            <p>　　His account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable 
              result, that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he 
              might have another hug of himself under the chin. Once apart from 
              him, I was determined to keep apart; and we walked back, side by 
              side, saying very little more by the way. Whether his spirits were 
              elevated by the communication I had made to him, or by his having 
              indulged in this retrospect, I don't know; but they were raised 
              by some influence. He talked more at dinner than was usual with 
              him; asked his mother (off duty, from the moment of our re-entering 
              the house) whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor; and 
              once looked at Agnes so, that I would have given all I had, for 
              leave to knock him down. </p>
            <p>　　When we three males were left alone after dinner, he got into 
              a more adventurous state. He had taken little or no wine; and I 
              presume it was the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him, 
              flushed perhaps by the temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I had observed yesterday, that he tried to entice Mr. Wickfield 
              to drink; and, interpreting the look which Agnes had given me as 
              she went out, had limited myself to one glass, and then proposed 
              that we should follow her. I would have done so again today; but 
              Uriah was too quick for me. </p>
            <p>　　'We seldom see our present visitor, sir,' he said, addressing 
              Mr. Wickfield, sitting, such a contrast to him, at the end of the 
              table, 'and I should propose to give him welcome in another glass 
              or two of wine, if you have no objections. Mr. Copperfield, your 
              elth and appiness!' </p>
            <p>　　I was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched 
              across to me; and then, with very different emotions, I took the 
              hand of the broken gentleman, his partner. </p>
            <p>　　'Come, fellow-partner,' said Uriah, 'if I may take the liberty, 
              - now, suppose you give us something or another appropriate to Copperfield!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I pass over Mr. Wickfield's proposing my aunt, his proposing 
              Mr. Dick, his proposing Doctors' Commons, his proposing Uriah, his 
              drinking everything twice; his consciousness of his own weakness, 
              the ineffectual effort that he made against it; the struggle between 
              his shame in Uriah's deportment, and his desire to conciliate him; 
              the manifest exultation with which Uriah twisted and turned, and 
              held him up before me. It made me sick at heart to see, and my hand 
              recoils from writing it. </p>
            <p>　　'Come, fellow-partner!' said Uriah, at last, 'I'll give you another 
              one, and I umbly ask for bumpers, seeing I intend to make it the 
              divinest of her sex.' </p>
            <p>　　Her father had his empty glass in his hand. I saw him set it 
              down, look at the picture she was so like, put his hand to his forehead, 
              and shrink back in his elbow-chair. </p>
            <p>　　'I'm an umble individual to give you her elth,' proceeded Uriah, 
              'but I admire - adore her.' </p>
            <p>　　No physical pain that her father's grey head could have borne, 
              I think, could have been more terrible to me, than the mental endurance 
              I saw compressed now within both his hands. </p>
            <p>　　'Agnes,' said Uriah, either not regarding him, or not knowing 
              what the nature of his action was, 'Agnes Wickfield is, I am safe 
              to say, the divinest of her sex. May I speak out, among friends? 
              To be her father is a proud distinction, but to be her usband -' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Spare me from ever again hearing such a cry, as that with which 
              her father rose up from the table! 'What's the matter?' said Uriah, 
              turning of a deadly colour. 'You are not gone mad, after all, Mr. 
              Wickfield, I hope? If I say I've an ambition to make your Agnes 
              my Agnes, I have as good a right to it as another man. I have a 
              better right to it than any other man!' </p>
            <p>　　I had my arms round Mr. Wickfield, imploring him by everything 
              that I could think of, oftenest of all by his love for Agnes, to 
              calm himself a little. He was mad for the moment; tearing out his 
              hair, beating his head, trying to force me from him, and to force 
              himself from me, not answering a word, not looking at or seeing 
              anyone; blindly striving for he knew not what, his face all staring 
              and distorted - a frightful spectacle. </p>
            <p>　　I conjured him, incoherently, but in the most impassioned manner, 
              not to abandon himself to this wildness, but to hear me. I besought 
              him to think of Agnes, to connect me with Agnes, to recollect how 
              Agnes and I had grown up together, how I honoured her and loved 
              her, how she was his pride and joy. I tried to bring her idea before 
              him in any form; I even reproached him with not having firmness 
              to spare her the knowledge of such a scene as this. I may have effected 
              something, or his wildness may have spent itself; but by degrees 
              he struggled less, and began to look at me - strangely at first, 
              then with recognition in his eyes. At length he said, 'I know, Trotwood! 
              My darling child and you - I know! But look at him!' </p>
            <p>　　He pointed to Uriah, pale and glowering in a corner, evidently 
              very much out in his calculations, and taken by surprise. </p>
            <p>　　'Look at my torturer,' he replied. 'Before him I have step by 
              step abandoned name and reputation, peace and quiet, house and home.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I have kept your name and reputation for you, and your peace 
              and quiet, and your house and home too,' said Uriah, with a sulky, 
              hurried, defeated air of compromise. 'Don't be foolish, Mr. Wickfield. 
              If I have gone a little beyond what you were prepared for, I can 
              go back, I suppose? There's no harm done.' </p>
            <p>　　'I looked for single motives in everyone,' said Mr. Wickfield, 
              and I was satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest. 
              But see what he is - oh, see what he is!' </p>
            <p>　　'You had better stop him, Copperfield, if you can,' cried Uriah, 
              with his long forefinger pointing towards me. 'He'll say something 
              presently - mind you! - he'll be sorry to have said afterwards, 
              and you'll be sorry to have heard!' </p>
            <p>　　'I'll say anything!' cried Mr. Wickfield, with a desperate air. 
              'Why should I not be in all the world's power if I am in yours?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mind! I tell you!' said Uriah, continuing to warn me. 'If you 
              don't stop his mouth, you're not his friend! Why shouldn't you be 
              in all the world's power, Mr. Wickfield? Because you have got a 
              daughter. You and me know what we know, don't we? Let sleeping dogs 
              lie - who wants to rouse 'em? I don't. Can't you see I am as umble 
              as I can be? I tell you, if I've gone too far, I'm sorry. What would 
              you have, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Trotwood, Trotwood!'exclaimed Mr. Wickfield, wringing his 
              hands. 'What I have come down to be, since I first saw you in this 
              house! I was on my downward way then, but the dreary, dreary road 
              I have traversed since! Weak indulgence has ruined me. Indulgence 
              in remembrance, and indulgence in forgetfulness. My natural grief 
              for my child's mother turned to disease; my natural love for my 
              child turned to disease. I have infected everything I touched. I 
              have brought misery on what I dearly love, I know -you know! I thought 
              it possible that I could truly love one creature in the world, and 
              not love the rest; I thought it possible that I could truly mourn 
              for one creature gone out of the world, and not have some part in 
              the grief of all who mourned. Thus the lessons of my life have been 
              perverted! I have preyed on my own morbid coward heart, and it has 
              preyed on me. Sordid in my grief, sordid in my love, sordid in my 
              miserable escape from the darker side of both, oh see the ruin I 
              am, and hate me, shun me!' </p>
            <p>　　He dropped into a chair, and weakly sobbed. The excitement into 
              which he had been roused was leaving him. Uriah came out of his 
              corner. </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know all I have done, in my fatuity,' said Mr. Wickfield, 
              putting out his hands, as if to deprecate my condemnation. 'He knows 
              best,' meaning Uriah Heep, 'for he has always been at my elbow, 
              whispering me. You see the millstone that he is about my neck. You 
              find him in my house, you find him in my business. You heard him, 
              but a little time ago. What need have I to say more!' </p>
            <p>　　'You haven't need to say so much, nor half so much, nor anything 
              at all,' observed Uriah, half defiant, and half fawning. 'You wouldn't 
              have took it up so, if it hadn't been for the wine. You'll think 
              better of it tomorrow, sir. If I have said too much, or more than 
              I meant, what of it? I haven't stood by it!' </p>
            <p>　　The door opened, and Agnes, gliding in, without a vestige of 
              colour in her face, put her arm round his neck, and steadily said, 
              'Papa, you are not well. Come with me!' </p>
            <p>　　He laid his head upon her shoulder, as if he were oppressed with 
              heavy shame, and went out with her. Her eyes met mine for but an 
              instant, yet I saw how much she knew of what had passed. </p>
            <p>　　'I didn't expect he'd cut up so rough, Master Copperfield,' said 
              Uriah. 'But it's nothing. I'll be friends with him tomorrow. It's 
              for his good. I'm umbly anxious for his good.' </p>
            <p>　　I gave him no answer, and went upstairs into the quiet room where 
              Agnes had so often sat beside me at my books. Nobody came near me 
              until late at night. I took up a book, and tried to read. I heard 
              the clocks strike twelve, and was still reading, without knowing 
              what I read, when Agnes touched me. </p>
            <p>　　'You will be going early in the morning, Trotwood! Let us say 
              good-bye, now!' </p>
            <p>　　She had been weeping, but her face then was so calm and beautiful! 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Heaven bless you!' she said, giving me her hand. </p>
            <p>　　'Dearest Agnes!' I returned, 'I see you ask me not to speak of 
              tonight - but is there nothing to be done?' </p>
            <p>　　'There is God to trust in!' she replied. </p>
            <p>　　'Can I do nothing- I, who come to you with my poor sorrows?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And make mine so much lighter,' she replied. 'Dear Trotwood, 
              no!' </p>
            <p>　　'Dear Agnes,' I said, 'it is presumptuous for me, who am so poor 
              in all in which you are so rich - goodness, resolution, all noble 
              qualities - to doubt or direct you; but you know how much I love 
              you, and how much I owe you. You will never sacrifice yourself to 
              a mistaken sense of duty, Agnes?' </p>
            <p>　　More agitated for a moment than I had ever seen her, she took 
              her hands from me, and moved a step back. </p>
            <p>　　'Say you have no such thought, dear Agnes! Much more than sister! 
              Think of the priceless gift of such a heart as yours, of such a 
              love as yours!' </p>
            <p>　　Oh! long, long afterwards, I saw that face rise up before me, 
              with its momentary look, not wondering, not accusing, not regretting. 
              Oh, long, long afterwards, I saw that look subside, as it did now, 
              into the lovely smile, with which she told me she had no fear for 
              herself - I need have none for her - and parted from me by the name 
              of Brother, and was gone! </p>
            <p>　　It was dark in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the 
              inn door. The day was just breaking when we were about to start, 
              and then, as I sat thinking of her, came struggling up the coach 
              side, through the mingled day and night, Uriah's head. </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield!' said he, in a croaking whisper, as he hung by 
              the iron on the roof, 'I thought you'd be glad to hear before you 
              went off, that there are no squares broke between us. I've been 
              into his room already, and we've made it all smooth. Why, though 
              I'm umble, I'm useful to him, you know; and he understands his interest 
              when he isn't in liquor! What an agreeable man he is, after all, 
              Master Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　I obliged myself to say that I was glad he had made his apology. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, to be sure!' said Uriah. 'When a person's umble, you know, 
              what's an apology? So easy! I say! I suppose,' with a jerk, 'you 
              have sometimes plucked a pear before it was ripe, Master Copperfield?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose I have,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'I did that last night,' said Uriah; 'but it'll ripen yet! It 
              only wants attending to. I can wait!' </p>
            <p>　　Profuse in his farewells, he got down again as the coachman got 
              up. For anything I know, he was eating something to keep the raw 
              morning air out; but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear 
              were ripe already, and he were smacking his lips over it. </p>

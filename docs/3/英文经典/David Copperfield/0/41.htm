            <p>　　 We had a very serious conversation in Buckingham Street that 
              night, about the domestic occurrences I have detailed in the last 
              chapter. My aunt was deeply interested in them, and walked up and 
              down the room with her arms folded, for more than two hours afterwards. 
              Whenever she was particularly discomposed, she always performed 
              one of these pedestrian feats; and the amount of her discomposure 
              might always be estimated by the duration of her walk. On this occasion 
              she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open 
              the bedroom door, and make a course for herself, comprising the 
              full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall; and while Mr. Dick 
              and I sat quietly by the fire, she kept passing in and out, along 
              this measured track, at an unchanging pace, with the regularity 
              of a clock-pendulum. </p>
            <p>　　When my aunt and I were left to ourselves by Mr. Dick's going 
              out to bed, I sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies. 
              By that time she was tired of walking, and sat by the fire with 
              her dress tucked up as usual. But instead of sitting in her usual 
              manner, holding her glass upon her knee, she suffered it to stand 
              neglected on the chimney-piece; and, resting her left elbow on her 
              right arm, and her chin on her left hand, looked thoughtfully at 
              me. As often as I raised my eyes from what I was about, I met hers. 
              'I am in the lovingest of tempers, my dear,' she would assure me 
              with a nod, 'but I am fidgeted and sorry!' </p>
            <p>　　I had been too busy to observe, until after she was gone to bed, 
              that she had left her night-mixture, as she always called it, untasted 
              on the chimney-piece. She came to her door, with even more than 
              her usual affection of manner, when I knocked to acquaint her with 
              this discovery; but only said, 'I have not the heart to take it, 
              Trot, tonight,' and shook her head, and went in again. </p>
            <p>　　She read my letter to the two old ladies, in the morning, and 
              approved of it. I posted it, and had nothing to do then, but wait, 
              as patiently as I could, for the reply. I was still in this state 
              of expectation, and had been, for nearly a week; when I left the 
              Doctor's one snowy night, to walk home. </p>
            <p>　　It had been a bitter day, and a cutting north-east wind had blown 
              for some time. The wind had gone down with the light, and so the 
              snow had come on. It was a heavy, settled fall, I recollect, in 
              great flakes; and it lay thick. The noise of wheels and tread of 
              people were as hushed, as if the streets had been strewn that depth 
              with feathers. </p>
            <p>　　My shortest way home, - and I naturally took the shortest way 
              on such a night - was through St. Martin's Lane. Now, the church 
              which gives its name to the lane, stood in a less free situation 
              at that time; there being no open space before it, and the lane 
              winding down to the Strand. As I passed the steps of the portico, 
              I encountered, at the corner, a woman's face. It looked in mine, 
              passed across the narrow lane, and disappeared. I knew it. I had 
              seen it somewhere. But I could not remember where. I had some association 
              with it, that struck upon my heart directly; but I was thinking 
              of anything else when it came upon me, and was confused. </p>
            <p>　　On the steps of the church, there was the stooping figure of 
              a man, who had put down some burden on the smooth snow, to adjust 
              it; my seeing the face, and my seeing him, were simultaneous. I 
              don't think I had stopped in my surprise; but, in any case, as I 
              went on, he rose, turned, and came down towards me. I stood face 
              to face with Mr. Peggotty! </p>
            <p>　　Then I remembered the woman. It was Martha, to whom Emily had 
              given the money that night in the kitchen. Martha Endell - side 
              by side with whom, he would not have seen his dear niece, Ham had 
              told me, for all the treasures wrecked in the sea. </p>
            <p>　　We shook hands heartily. At first, neither of us could speak 
              a word. </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy!' he said, gripping me tight, 'it do my art good 
              to see you, sir. Well met, well met!' </p>
            <p>　　'Well met, my dear old friend!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I had my thowts o' coming to make inquiration for you, sir, 
              tonight,' he said, 'but knowing as your aunt was living along wi' 
              you - fur I've been down yonder - Yarmouth way - I was afeerd it 
              was too late. I should have come early in the morning, sir, afore 
              going away.' </p>
            <p>　　'Again?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, sir,' he replied, patiently shaking his head, 'I'm away 
              tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　'Where were you going now?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Well!' he replied, shaking the snow out of his long hair, 'I 
              was a-going to turn in somewheers.' </p>
            <p>　　In those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of 
              the Golden Cross, the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his 
              misfortune, nearly opposite to where we stood. I pointed out the 
              gateway, put my arm through his, and we went across. Two or three 
              public-rooms opened out of the stable-yard; and looking into one 
              of them, and finding it empty, and a good fire burning, I took him 
              in there. </p>
            <p>　　When I saw him in the light, I observed, not only that his hair 
              was long and ragged, but that his face was burnt dark by the sun. 
              He was greyer, the lines in his face and forehead were deeper, and 
              he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all 
              varieties of weather; but he looked very strong, and like a man 
              upheld by steadfastness of purpose, whom nothing could tire out. 
              He shook the snow from his hat and clothes, and brushed it away 
              from his face, while I was inwardly making these remarks. As he 
              sat down opposite to me at a table, with his back to the door by 
              which we had entered, he put out his rough hand again, and grasped 
              mine warmly. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll tell you, Mas'r Davy,' he said, - 'wheer all I've been, 
              and what-all we've heerd. I've been fur, and we've heerd little; 
              but I'll tell you!' </p>
            <p>　　I rang the bell for something hot to drink. He would have nothing 
              stronger than ale; and while it was being brought, and being warmed 
              at the fire, he sat thinking. There was a fine, massive gravity 
              in his face, I did not venture to disturb. </p>
            <p>　　'When she was a child,' he said, lifting up his head soon after 
              we were left alone, 'she used to talk to me a deal about the sea, 
              and about them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue, and to 
              lay a-shining and a-shining in the sun. I thowt, odd times, as her 
              father being drownded made her think on it so much. I doen't know, 
              you see, but maybe she believed - or hoped - he had drifted out 
              to them parts, where the flowers is always a-blowing, and the country 
              bright.' </p>
            <p>　　'It is likely to have been a childish fancy,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'When she was - lost,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'I know'd in my mind, 
              as he would take her to them countries. I know'd in my mind, as 
              he'd have told her wonders of 'em, and how she was to be a lady 
              theer, and how he got her to listen to him fust, along o' sech like. 
              When we see his mother, I know'd quite well as I was right. I went 
              across-channel to France, and landed theer, as if I'd fell down 
              from the sky.' </p>
            <p>　　I saw the door move, and the snow drift in. I saw it move a little 
              more, and a hand softly interpose to keep it open. </p>
            <p>　　'I found out an English gen'leman as was in authority,' said 
              Mr. Peggotty, 'and told him I was a-going to seek my niece. He got 
              me them papers as I wanted fur to carry me through - I doen't rightly 
              know how they're called - and he would have give me money, but that 
              I was thankful to have no need on. I thank him kind, for all he 
              done, I'm sure! &quot;I've wrote afore you,&quot; he says to me, 
              &quot;and I shall speak to many as will come that way, and many 
              will know you, fur distant from here, when you're a-travelling alone.&quot; 
              I told him, best as I was able, what my gratitoode was, and went 
              away through France.' </p>
            <p>　　'Alone, and on foot?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Mostly a-foot,' he rejoined; 'sometimes in carts along with 
              people going to market; sometimes in empty coaches. Many mile a 
              day a-foot, and often with some poor soldier or another, travelling 
              to see his friends. I couldn't talk to him,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              'nor he to me; but we was company for one another, too, along the 
              dusty roads.' </p>
            <p>　　I should have known that by his friendly tone. </p>
            <p>　　'When I come to any town,' he pursued, 'I found the inn, and 
              waited about the yard till someone turned up (someone mostly did) 
              as know'd English. Then I told how that I was on my way to seek 
              my niece, and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the 
              house, and I waited to see any as seemed like her, going in or out. 
              When it warn't Em'ly, I went on agen. By little and little, when 
              I come to a new village or that, among the poor people, I found 
              they know'd about me. They would set me down at their cottage doors, 
              and give me what-not fur to eat and drink, and show me where to 
              sleep; and many a woman, Mas'r Davy, as has had a daughter of about 
              Em'ly's age, I've found a-waiting fur me, at Our Saviour's Cross 
              outside the village, fur to do me sim'lar kindnesses. Some has had 
              daughters as was dead. And God only knows how good them mothers 
              was to me!' </p>
            <p>　　It was Martha at the door. I saw her haggard, listening face 
              distinctly. My dread was lest he should turn his head, and see her 
              too. </p>
            <p>　　'They would often put their children - particular their little 
              girls,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'upon my knee; and many a time you might 
              have seen me sitting at their doors, when night was coming in, a'most 
              as if they'd been my Darling's children. Oh, my Darling!' </p>
            <p>　　Overpowered by sudden grief, he sobbed aloud. I laid my trembling 
              hand upon the hand he put before his face. 'Thankee, sir,' he said, 
              'doen't take no notice.' </p>
            <p>　　In a very little while he took his hand away and put it on his 
              breast, and went on with his story. 'They often walked with me,' 
              he said, 'in the morning, maybe a mile or two upon my road; and 
              when we parted, and I said, &quot;I'm very thankful to you! God 
              bless you!&quot; they always seemed to understand, and answered 
              pleasant. At last I come to the sea. It warn't hard, you may suppose, 
              for a seafaring man like me to work his way over to Italy. When 
              I got theer, I wandered on as I had done afore. The people was just 
              as good to me, and I should have gone from town to town, maybe the 
              country through, but that I got news of her being seen among them 
              Swiss mountains yonder. One as know'd his servant see 'em there, 
              all three, and told me how they travelled, and where they was. I 
              made fur them mountains, Mas'r Davy, day and night. Ever so fur 
              as I went, ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me. 
              But I come up with 'em, and I crossed 'em. When I got nigh the place 
              as I had been told of, I began to think within my own self, &quot;What 
              shall I do when I see her?&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　The listening face, insensible to the inclement night, still 
              drooped at the door, and the hands begged me - prayed me - not to 
              cast it forth. </p>
            <p>　　'I never doubted her,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'No! Not a bit! On'y 
              let her see my face - on'y let her beer my voice - on'y let my stanning 
              still afore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away 
              from, and the child she had been - and if she had growed to be a 
              royal lady, she'd have fell down at my feet! I know'd it well! Many 
              a time in my sleep had I heerd her cry out, &quot;Uncle!&quot; and 
              seen her fall like death afore me. Many a time in my sleep had I 
              raised her up, and whispered to her, &quot;Em'ly, my dear, I am 
              come fur to bring forgiveness, and to take you home!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　He stopped and shook his head, and went on with a sigh. </p>
            <p>　　'He was nowt to me now. Em'ly was all. I bought a country dress 
              to put upon her; and I know'd that, once found, she would walk beside 
              me over them stony roads, go where I would, and never, never, leave 
              me more. To put that dress upon her, and to cast off what she wore 
              - to take her on my arm again, and wander towards home - to stop 
              sometimes upon the road, and heal her bruised feet and her worse-bruised 
              heart - was all that I thowt of now. I doen't believe I should have 
              done so much as look at him. But, Mas'r Davy, it warn't to be - 
              not yet! I was too late, and they was gone. Wheer, I couldn't learn. 
              Some said beer, some said theer. I travelled beer, and I travelled 
              theer, but I found no Em'ly, and I travelled home.' </p>
            <p>　　'How long ago?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'A matter o' fower days,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'I sighted the old 
              boat arter dark, and the light a-shining in the winder. When I come 
              nigh and looked in through the glass, I see the faithful creetur 
              Missis Gummidge sittin' by the fire, as we had fixed upon, alone. 
              I called out, &quot;Doen't be afeerd! It's Dan'l!&quot; and I went 
              in. I never could have thowt the old boat would have been so strange!' 
              From some pocket in his breast, he took out, with a very careful 
              hand a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little 
              packets, which he laid upon the table. </p>
            <p>　　'This fust one come,' he said, selecting it from the rest, 'afore 
              I had been gone a week. A fifty pound Bank note, in a sheet of paper, 
              directed to me, and put underneath the door in the night. She tried 
              to hide her writing, but she couldn't hide it from Me!' </p>
            <p>　　He folded up the note again, with great patience and care, in 
              exactly the same form, and laid it on one side. </p>
            <p>　　'This come to Missis Gummidge,' he said, opening another, 'two 
              or three months ago.'After looking at it for some moments, he gave 
              it to me, and added in a low voice, 'Be so good as read it, sir.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I read as follows: </p>
            <p>　　 'Oh what will you feel when you see this writing, and know it 
              comes from my wicked hand! But try, try - not for my sake, but for 
              uncle's goodness, try to let your heart soften to me, only for a 
              little little time! Try, pray do, to relent towards a miserable 
              girl, and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well, and what 
              he said about me before you left off ever naming me among yourselves 
              - and whether, of a night, when it is my old time of coming home, 
              you ever see him look as if he thought of one he used to love so 
              dear. Oh, my heart is breaking when I think about it! I am kneeling 
              down to you, begging and praying you not to be as hard with me as 
              I deserve - as I well, well, know I deserve - but to be so gentle 
              and so good, as to write down something of him, and to send it to 
              me. You need not call me Little, you need not call me by the name 
              I have disgraced; but oh, listen to my agony, and have mercy on 
              me so far as to write me some word of uncle, never, never to be 
              seen in this world by my eyes again! </p>
            <p>　　'Dear, if your heart is hard towards me - justly hard, I know 
              - but, listen, if it is hard, dear, ask him I have wronged the most 
              - him whose wife I was to have been - before you quite decide against 
              my poor poor prayer! If he should be so compassionate as to say 
              that you might write something for me to read - I think he would, 
              oh, I think he would, if you would only ask him, for he always was 
              so brave and so forgiving - tell him then (but not else), that when 
              I hear the wind blowing at night, I feel as if it was passing angrily 
              from seeing him and uncle, and was going up to God against me. Tell 
              him that if I was to die tomorrow (and oh, if I was fit, I would 
              be so glad to die!) I would bless him and uncle with my last words, 
              and pray for his happy home with my last breath!' </p>
            <p>　　 Some money was enclosed in this letter also. Five pounds. It 
              was untouched like the previous sum, and he refolded it in the same 
              way. Detailed instructions were added relative to the address of 
              a reply, which, although they betrayed the intervention of several 
              hands, and made it difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion 
              in reference to her place of concealment, made it at least not unlikely 
              that she had written from that spot where she was stated to have 
              been seen. </p>
            <p>　　'What answer was sent?' I inquired of Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Missis Gummidge,' he returned, 'not being a good scholar, sir, 
              Ham kindly drawed it out, and she made a copy on it. They told her 
              I was gone to seek her, and what my parting words was.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is that another letter in your hand?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'It's money, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty, unfolding it a little way. 
              'Ten pound, you see. And wrote inside, &quot;From a true friend,&quot; 
              like the fust. But the fust was put underneath the door, and this 
              come by the post, day afore yesterday. I'm a-going to seek her at 
              the post-mark.' </p>
            <p>　　He showed it to me. It was a town on the Upper Rhine. He had 
              found out, at Yarmouth, some foreign dealers who knew that country, 
              and they had drawn him a rude map on paper, which he could very 
              well understand. He laid it between us on the table; and, with his 
              chin resting on one hand, tracked his course upon it with the other. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I asked him how Ham was? He shook his head. </p>
            <p>　　'He works,' he said, 'as bold as a man can. His name's as good, 
              in all that part, as any man's is, anywheres in the wureld. Anyone's 
              hand is ready to help him, you understand, and his is ready to help 
              them. He's never been heerd fur to complain. But my sister's belief 
              is ('twixt ourselves) as it has cut him deep.' </p>
            <p>　　'Poor fellow, I can believe it!' </p>
            <p>　　'He ain't no care, Mas'r Davy,' said Mr. Peggotty in a solemn 
              whisper - 'kinder no care no-how for his life. When a man's wanted 
              for rough sarvice in rough weather, he's theer. When there's hard 
              duty to be done with danger in it, he steps for'ard afore all his 
              mates. And yet he's as gentle as any child. There ain't a child 
              in Yarmouth that doen't know him.' </p>
            <p>　　He gathered up the letters thoughtfully, smoothing them with 
              his hand; put them into their little bundle; and placed it tenderly 
              in his breast again. The face was gone from the door. I still saw 
              the snow drifting in; but nothing else was there. </p>
            <p>　　'Well!' he said, looking to his bag, 'having seen you tonight, 
              Mas'r Davy (and that doos me good!), I shall away betimes tomorrow 
              morning. You have seen what I've got heer'; putting his hand on 
              where the little packet lay; 'all that troubles me is, to think 
              that any harm might come to me, afore that money was give back. 
              If I was to die, and it was lost, or stole, or elseways made away 
              with, and it was never know'd by him but what I'd took it, I believe 
              the t'other wureld wouldn't hold me! I believe I must come back!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He rose, and I rose too; we grasped each other by the hand again, 
              before going out. </p>
            <p>　　'I'd go ten thousand mile,' he said, 'I'd go till I dropped dead, 
              to lay that money down afore him. If I do that, and find my Em'ly, 
              I'm content. If I doen't find her, maybe she'll come to hear, sometime, 
              as her loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended 
              his life; and if I know her, even that will turn her home at last!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　As he went out into the rigorous night, I saw the lonely figure 
              flit away before us. I turned him hastily on some pretence, and 
              held him in conversation until it was gone. </p>
            <p>　　He spoke of a traveller's house on the Dover Road, where he knew 
              he could find a clean, plain lodging for the night. I went with 
              him over Westminster Bridge, and parted from him on the Surrey shore. 
              Everything seemed, to my imagination, to be hushed in reverence 
              for him, as he resumed his solitary journey through the snow. </p>
            <p>　　I returned to the inn yard, and, impressed by my remembrance 
              of the face, looked awfully around for it. It was not there. The 
              snow had covered our late footprints; my new track was the only 
              one to be seen; and even that began to die away (it snowed so fast) 
              as I looked back over my shoulder. </p>

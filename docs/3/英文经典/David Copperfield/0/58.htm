            <p>　　 One thing more, I had to do, before yielding myself to the shock 
              of these emotions. It was, to conceal what had occurred, from those 
              who were going away; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy 
              ignorance. In this, no time was to be lost. </p>
            <p>　　I took Mr. Micawber aside that same night, and confided to him 
              the task of standing between Mr. Peggotty and intelligence of the 
              late catastrophe. He zealously undertook to do so, and to intercept 
              any newspaper through which it might, without such precautions, 
              reach him. </p>
            <p>　　'If it penetrates to him, sir,' said Mr. Micawber, striking himself 
              on the breast, 'it shall first pass through this body!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, I must observe, in his adaptation of himself to 
              a new state of society, had acquired a bold buccaneering air, not 
              absolutely lawless, but defensive and prompt. One might have supposed 
              him a child of the wilderness, long accustomed to live out of the 
              confines of civilization, and about to return to his native wilds. 
            </p>
            <p>　　He had provided himself, among other things, with a complete 
              suit of oilskin, and a straw hat with a very low crown, pitched 
              or caulked on the outside. In this rough clothing, with a common 
              mariner's telescope under his arm, and a shrewd trick of casting 
              up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather, he was far 
              more nautical, after his manner, than Mr. Peggotty. His whole family, 
              if I may so express it, were cleared for action. I found Mrs. Micawber 
              in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets, made fast under 
              the chin; and in a shawl which tied her up (as I had been tied up, 
              when my aunt first received me) like a bundle, and was secured behind 
              at the waist, in a strong knot. Miss Micawber I found made snug 
              for stormy weather, in the same manner; with nothing superfluous 
              about her. Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey shirt, 
              and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw; and the children were 
              done up, like preserved meats, in impervious cases. Both Mr. Micawber 
              and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the 
              wrists, as being ready to lend a hand in any direction, and to 'tumble 
              up', or sing out, 'Yeo - Heave - Yeo!' on the shortest notice. </p>
            <p>　　Thus Traddles and I found them at nightfall, assembled on the 
              wooden steps, at that time known as Hungerford Stairs, watching 
              the departure of a boat with some of their property on board. I 
              had told Traddles of the terrible event, and it had greatly shocked 
              him; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a 
              secret, and he had come to help me in this last service. It was 
              here that I took Mr. Micawber aside, and received his promise. </p>
            <p>　　The Micawber family were lodged in a little, dirty, tumble-down 
              public-house, which in those days was close to the stairs, and whose 
              protruding wooden rooms overhung the river. The family, as emigrants, 
              being objects of some interest in and about Hungerford, attracted 
              so many beholders, that we were glad to take refuge in their room. 
              It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs, with the tide flowing 
              underneath. My aunt and Agnes were there, busily making some little 
              extra comforts, in the way of dress, for the children. Peggotty 
              was quietly assisting, with the old insensible work-box, yard-measure, 
              and bit of wax-candle before her, that had now outlived so much. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was not easy to answer her inquiries; still less to whisper 
              Mr. Peggotty, when Mr. Micawber brought him in, that I had given 
              the letter, and all was well. But I did both, and made them happy. 
              If I showed any trace of what I felt, my own sorrows were sufficient 
              to account for it. </p>
            <p>　　'And when does the ship sail, Mr. Micawber?' asked my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt 
              or his wife, by degrees, and said, sooner than he had expected yesterday. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'The boat brought you word, I suppose?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'It did, ma'am,' he returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said my aunt. 'And she sails -' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' he replied, 'I am informed that we must positively be 
              on board before seven tomorrow morning.' </p>
            <p>　　'Heyday!' said my aunt, 'that's soon. Is it a sea-going fact, 
              Mr. Peggotty?' ''Tis so, ma'am. She'll drop down the river with 
              that theer tide. If Mas'r Davy and my sister comes aboard at Gravesen', 
              arternoon o' next day, they'll see the last on us.' </p>
            <p>　　'And that we shall do,' said I, 'be sure!' </p>
            <p>　　'Until then, and until we are at sea,' observed Mr. Micawber, 
              with a glance of intelligence at me, 'Mr. Peggotty and myself will 
              constantly keep a double look-out together, on our goods and chattels. 
              Emma, my love,' said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat in his magnificent 
              way, 'my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit, 
              in my ear, that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients 
              necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage 
              which is peculiarly associated, in our minds, with the Roast Beef 
              of Old England. I allude to - in short, Punch. Under ordinary circumstances, 
              I should scruple to entreat the indulgence of Miss Trotwood and 
              Miss Wickfield, but-' </p>
            <p>　　'I can only say for myself,' said my aunt, 'that I will drink 
              all happiness and success to you, Mr. Micawber, with the utmost 
              pleasure.' </p>
            <p>　　'And I too!' said Agnes, with a smile. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber immediately descended to the bar, where he appeared 
              to be quite at home; and in due time returned with a steaming jug. 
              I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with 
              his own clasp-knife, which, as became the knife of a practical settler, 
              was about a foot long; and which he wiped, not wholly without ostentation, 
              on the sleeve of his coat. Mrs. Micawber and the two elder members 
              of the family I now found to be provided with similar formidable 
              instruments, while every child had its own wooden spoon attached 
              to its body by a strong line. In a similar anticipation of life 
              afloat, and in the Bush, Mr. Micawber, instead of helping Mrs. Micawber 
              and his eldest son and daughter to punch, in wine-glasses, which 
              he might easily have done, for there was a shelf-full in the room, 
              served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots; 
              and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his 
              own particular pint pot, and putting it in his pocket at the close 
              of the evening. </p>
            <p>　　'The luxuries of the old country,' said Mr. Micawber, with an 
              intense satisfaction in their renouncement, 'we abandon. The denizens 
              of the forest cannot, of course, expect to participate in the refinements 
              of the land of the Free.' </p>
            <p>　　Here, a boy came in to say that Mr. Micawber was wanted downstairs. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I have a presentiment,' said Mrs. Micawber, setting down her 
              tin pot, 'that it is a member of my family!' </p>
            <p>　　'If so, my dear,' observed Mr. Micawber, with his usual suddenness 
              of warmth on that subject, 'as the member of your family - whoever 
              he, she, or it, may be - has kept us waiting for a considerable 
              period, perhaps the Member may now wait MY convenience.' </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber,' said his wife, in a low tone, 'at such a time as 
              this -' </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;It is not meet,&quot;' said Mr. Micawber, rising, '&quot;that 
              every nice offence should bear its comment!&quot; Emma, I stand 
              reproved.' </p>
            <p>　　'The loss, Micawber,' observed his wife, 'has been my family's, 
              not yours. If my family are at length sensible of the deprivation 
              to which their own conduct has, in the past, exposed them, and now 
              desire to extend the hand of fellowship, let it not be repulsed.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' he returned, 'so be it!' </p>
            <p>　　'If not for their sakes; for mine, Micawber,' said his wife. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Emma,' he returned, 'that view of the question is, at such a 
              moment, irresistible. I cannot, even now, distinctly pledge myself 
              to fall upon your family's neck; but the member of your family, 
              who is now in attendance, shall have no genial warmth frozen by 
              me.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber withdrew, and was absent some little time; in the 
              course of which Mrs. Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension 
              that words might have arisen between him and the Member. At length 
              the same boy reappeared, and presented me with a note written in 
              pencil, and headed, in a legal manner, 'Heep v. Micawber'. From 
              this document, I learned that Mr. Micawber being again arrested, 
              'Was in a final paroxysm of despair; and that he begged me to send 
              him his knife and pint pot, by bearer, as they might prove serviceable 
              during the brief remainder of his existence, in jail. He also requested, 
              as a last act of friendship, that I would see his family to the 
              Parish Workhouse, and forget that such a Being ever lived. </p>
            <p>　　Of course I answered this note by going down with the boy to 
              pay the money, where I found Mr. Micawber sitting in a corner, looking 
              darkly at the Sheriff 's Officer who had effected the capture. On 
              his release, he embraced me with the utmost fervour; and made an 
              entry of the transaction in his pocket-book - being very particular, 
              I recollect, about a halfpenny I inadvertently omitted from my statement 
              of the total. </p>
            <p>　　This momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another 
              transaction. On our return to the room upstairs (where he accounted 
              for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances 
              over which he had no control), he took out of it a large sheet of 
              paper, folded small, and quite covered with long sums, carefully 
              worked. From the glimpse I had of them, I should say that I never 
              saw such sums out of a school ciphering-book. These, it seemed, 
              were calculations of compound interest on what he called 'the principal 
              amount of forty-one, ten, eleven and a half', for various periods. 
              After a careful consideration of these, and an elaborate estimate 
              of his resources, he had come to the conclusion to select that sum 
              which represented the amount with compound interest to two years, 
              fifteen calendar months, and fourteen days, from that date. For 
              this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness, which he handed 
              over to Traddles on the spot, a discharge of his debt in full (as 
              between man and man), with many acknowledgements. </p>
            <p>　　'I have still a presentiment,' said Mrs. Micawber, pensively 
              shaking her head, 'that my family will appear on board, before we 
              finally depart.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too, 
              but he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it. </p>
            <p>　　'If you have any opportunity of sending letters home, on your 
              passage, Mrs. Micawber,' said my aunt, 'you must let us hear from 
              you, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Miss Trotwood,' she replied, 'I shall only be too happy 
              to think that anyone expects to hear from us. I shall not fail to 
              correspond. Mr. Copperfield, I trust, as an old and familiar friend, 
              will not object to receive occasional intelligence, himself, from 
              one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious?' </p>
            <p>　　I said that I should hope to hear, whenever she had an opportunity 
              of writing. </p>
            <p>　　'Please Heaven, there will be many such opportunities,' said 
              Mr. Micawber. 'The ocean, in these times, is a perfect fleet of 
              ships; and we can hardly fail to encounter many, in running over. 
              It is merely crossing,' said Mr. Micawber, trifling with his eye-glass, 
              'merely crossing. The distance is quite imaginary.' </p>
            <p>　　I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, 
              that, when he went from London to Canterbury, he should have talked 
              as if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth; and, when 
              he went from England to Australia, as if he were going for a little 
              trip across the channel. </p>
            <p>　　'On the voyage, I shall endeavour,' said Mr. Micawber, 'occasionally 
              to spin them a yarn; and the melody of my son Wilkins will, I trust, 
              be acceptable at the galley-fire. When Mrs. Micawber has her sea-legs 
              on - an expression in which I hope there is no conventional impropriety 
              - she will give them, I dare say, &quot;Little Tafflin&quot;. Porpoises 
              and dolphins, I believe, will be frequently observed athwart our 
              Bows; and, either on the starboard or the larboard quarter, objects 
              of interest will be continually descried. In short,' said Mr. Micawber, 
              with the old genteel air, 'the probability is, all will be found 
              so exciting, alow and aloft, that when the lookout, stationed in 
              the main-top, cries Land-oh! we shall be very considerably astonished!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　With that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot, 
              as if he had made the voyage, and had passed a first-class examination 
              before the highest naval authorities. </p>
            <p>　　' What I chiefly hope, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 
              'is, that in some branches of our family we may live again in the 
              old country. Do not frown, Micawber! I do not now refer to my own 
              family, but to our children's children. However vigorous the sapling,' 
              said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, 'I cannot forget the parent-tree; 
              and when our race attains to eminence and fortune, I own I should 
              wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' said Mr. Micawber, 'Britannia must take her chance. 
              I am bound to say that she has never done much for me, and that 
              I have no particular wish upon the subject.' </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber,' returned Mrs. Micawber, 'there, you are wrong. You 
              are going out, Micawber, to this distant clime, to strengthen, not 
              to weaken, the connexion between yourself and Albion.' </p>
            <p>　　'The connexion in question, my love,' rejoined Mr. Micawber, 
              'has not laid me, I repeat, under that load of personal obligation, 
              that I am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber,' returned Mrs. Micawber. 'There, I again say, you 
              are wrong. You do not know your power, Micawber. It is that which 
              will strengthen, even in this step you are about to take, the connexion 
              between yourself and Albion.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber sat in his elbow-chair, with his eyebrows raised; 
              half receiving and half repudiating Mrs. Micawber's views as they 
              were stated, but very sensible of their foresight. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'I wish Mr. Micawber 
              to feel his position. It appears to me highly important that Mr. 
              Micawber should, from the hour of his embarkation, feel his position. 
              Your old knowledge of me, my dear Mr. Copperfield, will have told 
              you that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber. My 
              disposition is, if I may say so, eminently practical. I know that 
              this is a long voyage. I know that it will involve many privations 
              and inconveniences. I cannot shut my eyes to those facts. But I 
              also know what Mr. Micawber is. I know the latent power of Mr. Micawber. 
              And therefore I consider it vitally important that Mr. Micawber 
              should feel his position.' </p>
            <p>　　'My love,' he observed, 'perhaps you will allow me to remark 
              that it is barely possible that I DO feel my position at the present 
              moment.' </p>
            <p>　　'I think not, Micawber,' she rejoined. 'Not fully. My dear Mr. 
              Copperfield, Mr. Micawber's is not a common case. Mr. Micawber is 
              going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully 
              understood and appreciated for the first time. I wish Mr. Micawber 
              to take his stand upon that vessel's prow, and firmly say, &quot;This 
              country I am come to conquer! Have you honours? Have you riches? 
              Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument? Let them be brought 
              forward. They are mine!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, glancing at us all, seemed to think there was a 
              good deal in this idea. </p>
            <p>　　'I wish Mr. Micawber, if I make myself understood,' said Mrs. 
              Micawber, in her argumentative tone, 'to be the Caesar of his own 
              fortunes. That, my dear Mr. Copperfield, appears to me to be his 
              true position. From the first moment of this voyage, I wish Mr. 
              Micawber to stand upon that vessel's prow and say, &quot;Enough 
              of delay: enough of disappointment: enough of limited means. That 
              was in the old country. This is the new. Produce your reparation. 
              Bring it forward!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner, as if he were 
              then stationed on the figure-head. </p>
            <p>　　'And doing that,' said Mrs. Micawber, '- feeling his position 
              - am I not right in saying that Mr. Micawber will strengthen, and 
              not weaken, his connexion with Britain? An important public character 
              arising in that hemisphere, shall I be told that its influence will 
              not be felt at home? Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber, 
              wielding the rod of talent and of power in Australia, will be nothing 
              in England? I am but a woman; but I should be unworthy of myself 
              and of my papa, if I were guilty of such absurd weakness.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Micawber's conviction that her arguments were unanswerable, 
              gave a moral elevation to her tone which I think I had never heard 
              in it before. </p>
            <p>　　'And therefore it is,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'that I the more wish, 
              that, at a future period, we may live again on the parent soil. 
              Mr. Micawber may be - I cannot disguise from myself that the probability 
              is, Mr. Micawber will be - a page of History; and he ought then 
              to be represented in the country which gave him birth, and did NOT 
              give him employment!' </p>
            <p>　　'My love,' observed Mr. Micawber, 'it is impossible for me not 
              to be touched by your affection. I am always willing to defer to 
              your good sense. What will be - will be. Heaven forbid that I should 
              grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated 
              by our descendants!' </p>
            <p>　　'That's well,' said my aunt, nodding towards Mr. Peggotty, 'and 
              I drink my love to you all, and every blessing and success attend 
              you!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing, one 
              on each knee, to join Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in drinking to all of 
              us in return; and when he and the Micawbers cordially shook hands 
              as comrades, and his brown face brightened with a smile, I felt 
              that he would make his way, establish a good name, and be beloved, 
              go where he would. </p>
            <p>　　Even the children were instructed, each to dip a wooden spoon 
              into Mr. Micawber's pot, and pledge us in its contents. When this 
              was done, my aunt and Agnes rose, and parted from the emigrants. 
              It was a sorrowful farewell. They were all crying; the children 
              hung about Agnes to the last; and we left poor Mrs. Micawber in 
              a very distressed condition, sobbing and weeping by a dim candle, 
              that must have made the room look, from the river, like a miserable 
              light-house. </p>
            <p>　　I went down again next morning to see that they were away. They 
              had departed, in a boat, as early as five o'clock. It was a wonderful 
              instance to me of the gap such partings make, that although my association 
              of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden stairs 
              dated only from last night, both seemed dreary and deserted, now 
              that they were gone. </p>
            <p>　　In the afternoon of the next day, my old nurse and I went down 
              to Gravesend. We found the ship in the river, surrounded by a crowd 
              of boats; a favourable wind blowing; the signal for sailing at her 
              mast-head. I hired a boat directly, and we put off to her; and getting 
              through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre, 
              went on board. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty was waiting for us on deck. He told me that Mr. 
              Micawber had just now been arrested again (and for the last time) 
              at the suit of Heep, and that, in compliance with a request I had 
              made to him, he had paid the money, which I repaid him. He then 
              took us down between decks; and there, any lingering fears I had 
              of his having heard any rumours of what had happened, were dispelled 
              by Mr. Micawber's coming out of the gloom, taking his arm with an 
              air of friendship and protection, and telling me that they had scarcely 
              been asunder for a moment, since the night before last. </p>
            <p>　　It was such a strange scene to me, and so confined and dark, 
              that, at first, I could make out hardly anything; but, by degrees, 
              it cleared, as my eyes became more accustomed to the gloom, and 
              I seemed to stand in a picture by OSTADE. Among the great beams, 
              bulks, and ringbolts of the ship, and the emigrant-berths, and chests, 
              and bundles, and barrels, and heaps of miscellaneous baggage -'lighted 
              up, here and there, by dangling lanterns; and elsewhere by the yellow 
              daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchway - were crowded groups 
              of people, making new friendships, taking leave of one another, 
              talking, laughing, crying, eating and drinking; some, already settled 
              down into the possession of their few feet of space, with their 
              little households arranged, and tiny children established on stools, 
              or in dwarf elbow-chairs; others, despairing of a resting-place, 
              and wandering disconsolately. From babies who had but a week or 
              two of life behind them, to crooked old men and women who seemed 
              to have but a week or two of life before them; and from ploughmen 
              bodily carrying out soil of England on their boots, to smiths taking 
              away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins; every age and 
              occupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the 
              'tween decks. </p>
            <p>　　As my eye glanced round this place, I thought I saw sitting, 
              by an open port, with one of the Micawber children near her, a figure 
              like Emily's; it first attracted my attention, by another figure 
              parting from it with a kiss; and as it glided calmly away through 
              the disorder, reminding me of - Agnes! But in the rapid motion and 
              confusion, and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts, I lost it 
              again; and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were 
              being warned to leave the ship; that my nurse was crying on a chest 
              beside me; and that Mrs. Gummidge, assisted by some younger stooping 
              woman in black, was busily arranging Mr. Peggotty's goods. </p>
            <p>　　'Is there any last wured, Mas'r Davy?' said he. 'Is there any 
              one forgotten thing afore we parts?' </p>
            <p>　　'One thing!' said I. 'Martha!' </p>
            <p>　　He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder, 
              and Martha stood before me. </p>
            <p>　　'Heaven bless you, you good man!' cried I. 'You take her with 
              you!' </p>
            <p>　　She answered for him, with a burst of tears. I could speak no 
              more at that time, but I wrung his hand; and if ever I have loved 
              and honoured any man, I loved and honoured that man in my soul. 
            </p>
            <p>　　The ship was clearing fast of strangers. The greatest trial that 
              I had, remained. I told him what the noble spirit that was gone, 
              had given me in charge to say at parting. It moved him deeply. But 
              when he charged me, in return, with many messages of affection and 
              regret for those deaf ears, he moved me more. </p>
            <p>　　The time was come. I embraced him, took my weeping nurse upon 
              my arm, and hurried away. On deck, I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber. 
              She was looking distractedly about for her family, even then; and 
              her last words to me were, that she never would desert Mr. Micawber. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We went over the side into our boat, and lay at a little distance, 
              to see the ship wafted on her course. It was then calm, radiant 
              sunset. She lay between us, and the red light; and every taper line 
              and spar was visible against the glow. A sight at once so beautiful, 
              so mournful, and so hopeful, as the glorious ship, lying, still, 
              on the flushed water, with all the life on board her crowded at 
              the bulwarks, and there clustering, for a moment, bare-headed and 
              silent, I never saw. </p>
            <p>　　Silent, only for a moment. As the sails rose to the wind, and 
              the ship began to move, there broke from all the boats three resounding 
              cheers, which those on board took up, and echoed back, and which 
              were echoed and re-echoed. My heart burst out when I heard the sound, 
              and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs - and then I 
              saw her! </p>
            <p>　　Then I saw her, at her uncle's side, and trembling on his shoulder. 
              He pointed to us with an eager hand; and she saw us, and waved her 
              last good-bye to me. Aye, Emily, beautiful and drooping, cling to 
              him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart; for he has clung 
              to thee, with all the might of his great love! </p>
            <p>　　Surrounded by the rosy light, and standing high upon the deck, 
              apart together, she clinging to him, and he holding her, they solemnly 
              passed away. The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were 
              rowed ashore - and fallen darkly upon me. </p>

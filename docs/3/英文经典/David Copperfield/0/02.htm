            <p>　　Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether 
              that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. 
              To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I 
              was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve 
              o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, 
              and I began to cry, simultaneously. </p>
            <p>　　In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared 
              by the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had 
              taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any 
              possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I 
              was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged 
              to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, 
              as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born 
              towards the small hours on a Friday night. </p>
            <p>　　I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can 
              show better than my history whether that prediction was verified 
              or falsified by the result. On the second branch of the question, 
              I will only remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance 
              while I was still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do 
              not at all complain of having been kept out of this property; and 
              if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is 
              heartily welcome to keep it. </p>
            <p>　　I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the 
              newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going 
              people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith 
              and preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there 
              was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected 
              with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, 
              and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning 
              on any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn 
              at a dead loss - for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry 
              was in the market then - and ten years afterwards, the caul was 
              put up in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members 
              at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was 
              present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable 
              and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way. 
              The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket, 
              who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated five shillings, 
              all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short - as it took an immense 
              time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect 
              to prove to her. It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable 
              down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in 
              bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was, to the last, 
              her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her 
              life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she 
              was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation 
              at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to 
              go 'meandering' about the world. It was in vain to represent to 
              her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from 
              this objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis 
              and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 
              'Let us have no meandering.' </p>
            <p>　　Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they 
              say in Scotland. I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had 
              closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened 
              on it. There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection 
              that he never saw me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy 
              remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his 
              white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion 
              I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when 
              our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle, and 
              the doors of our house were - almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes 
              - bolted and locked against it. </p>
            <p>　　An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, 
              of whom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal 
              magnate of our family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor 
              mother always called her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread 
              of this formidable personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), 
              had been married to a husband younger than herself, who was very 
              handsome, except in the sense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, 
              that handsome does' - for he was strongly suspected of having beaten 
              Miss Betsey, and even of having once, on a disputed question of 
              supplies, made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her 
              out of a two pair of stairs' window. These evidences of an incompatibility 
              of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off, and effect a separation 
              by mutual consent. He went to India with his capital, and there, 
              according to a wild legend in our family, he was once seen riding 
              on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think it must have 
              been a Baboo - or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his death 
              reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody 
              knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name 
              again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way 
              off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant, 
              and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible 
              retirement. </p>
            <p>　　My father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she 
              was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother 
              was 'a wax doll'. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her 
              to be not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. 
              He was double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate 
              constitution. He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six 
              months before I came into the world. </p>
            <p>　　This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may 
              be excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can 
              make no claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters 
              stood; or to have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my 
              own senses, of what follows. </p>
            <p>　　My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and 
              very low in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding 
              heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was 
              already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer 
              upstairs, to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival; 
              my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire, that bright, windy March 
              afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful of ever coming 
              alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her eyes 
              as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady 
              coming up the garden. </p>
            <p>　　MY mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it 
              was Miss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, 
              over the garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with 
              a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could 
              have belonged to nobody else. </p>
            <p>　　When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity. 
              My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like 
              any ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she 
              came and looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of 
              her nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother 
              used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment. </p>
            <p>　　She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced 
              I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday. </p>
            <p>　　My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind 
              it in the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and 
              inquiringly, began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like 
              a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. 
              Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother, like one who was 
              accustomed to be obeyed, to come and open the door. My mother went. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,' said Miss Betsey; the emphasis 
              referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said my mother, faintly. </p>
            <p>　　'Miss Trotwood,' said the visitor. 'You have heard of her, I 
              dare say?' </p>
            <p>　　My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable 
              consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering 
              pleasure. </p>
            <p>　　'Now you see her,' said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, 
              and begged her to walk in. </p>
            <p>　　They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire 
              in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted 
              - not having been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and 
              when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, 
              after vainly trying to restrain herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, 
              tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in a hurry. 'Don't do that! Come, come!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until 
              she had had her cry out. </p>
            <p>　　'Take off your cap, child,' said Miss Betsey, 'and let me see 
              you.' </p>
            <p>　　MY mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with 
              this odd request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore 
              she did as she was told, and did it with such nervous hands that 
              her hair (which was luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her 
              face. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, bless my heart!' exclaimed Miss Betsey. 'You are a very 
              Baby!' </p>
            <p>　　My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even 
              for her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor 
              thing, and said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but 
              a childish widow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived. 
              In a short pause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss 
              Betsey touch her hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking 
              at her, in her timid hope, she found that lady sitting with the 
              skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands folded on one knee, and 
              her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'In the name of Heaven,' said Miss Betsey, suddenly, 'why Rookery?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Do you mean the house, ma'am?' asked my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'Why Rookery?' said Miss Betsey. 'Cookery would have been more 
              to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either 
              of you.' </p>
            <p>　　'The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,' returned my mother. 
              'When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks 
              about it.' </p>
            <p>　　The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some 
              tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my 
              mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms 
              bent to one another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and 
              after a few seconds of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, 
              tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were 
              really too wicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged 
              old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks 
              upon a stormy sea. </p>
            <p>　　'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'The -? ' My mother had been thinking of something else. </p>
            <p>　　'The rooks - what has become of them?' asked Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'There have not been any since we have lived here,' said my mother. 
              'We thought - Mr. Copperfield thought - it was quite a large rookery; 
              but the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them 
              a long while.' </p>
            <p>　　'David Copperfield all over!' cried Miss Betsey. 'David Copperfield 
              from head to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there's not a rook 
              near it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield,' returned my mother, 'is dead, and if you dare 
              to speak unkindly of him to me -' </p>
            <p>　　My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention 
              of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily 
              have settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far 
              better training for such an encounter than she was that evening. 
              But it passed with the action of rising from her chair; and she 
              sat down again very meekly, and fainted. </p>
            <p>　　When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her, 
              whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The 
              twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly 
              as they saw each other, they could not have done that without the 
              aid of the fire. </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she 
              had only been taking a casual look at the prospect; 'and when do 
              you expect -' </p>
            <p>　　'I am all in a tremble,' faltered my mother. 'I don't know what's 
              the matter. I shall die, I am sure!' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, no,' said Miss Betsey. 'Have some tea.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?' cried 
              my mother in a helpless manner. </p>
            <p>　　'Of course it will,' said Miss Betsey. 'It's nothing but fancy. 
              What do you call your girl?' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,' said my mother 
              innocently. </p>
            <p>　　'Bless the Baby!' exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting 
              the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but 
              applying it to my mother instead of me, 'I don't mean that. I mean 
              your servant-girl.' </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty,' said my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty!' repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. 'Do 
              you mean to say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian 
              church, and got herself named Peggotty?' 'It's her surname,' said 
              my mother, faintly. 'Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her 
              Christian name was the same as mine.' </p>
            <p>　　'Here! Peggotty!' cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. 
              'Tea. Your mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.' </p>
            <p>　　Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she 
              had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been 
              a house, and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming 
              along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, 
              Miss Betsey shut the door again, and sat down as before: with her 
              feet on the fender, the skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands 
              folded on one knee. </p>
            <p>　　'You were speaking about its being a girl,' said Miss Betsey. 
              'I have no doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it 
              must be a girl. Now child, from the moment of the birth of this 
              girl -' </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps boy,' my mother took the liberty of putting in. </p>
            <p>　　'I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,' returned 
              Miss Betsey. 'Don't contradict. From the moment of this girl's birth, 
              child, I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, 
              and I beg you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must 
              be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be 
              no trifling with HER affections, poor dear. She must be well brought 
              up, and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where 
              they are not deserved. I must make that MY care.' </p>
            <p>　　There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these 
              sentences, as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and 
              she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint. 
              So my mother suspected, at least, as she observed her by the low 
              glimmer of the fire: too much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy 
              in herself, and too subdued and bewildered altogether, to observe 
              anything very clearly, or to know what to say. </p>
            <p>　　'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, when she 
              had been silent for a little while, and these motions of her head 
              had gradually ceased. 'Were you comfortable together?' </p>
            <p>　　'We were very happy,' said my mother. 'Mr. Copperfield was only 
              too good to me.' </p>
            <p>　　'What, he spoilt you, I suppose?' returned Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough 
              world again, yes, I fear he did indeed,' sobbed my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'Well! Don't cry!' said Miss Betsey. 'You were not equally matched, 
              child - if any two people can be equally matched - and so I asked 
              the question. You were an orphan, weren't you?' 'Yes.' </p>
            <p>　　'And a governess?' </p>
            <p>　　'I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came 
              to visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great 
              deal of notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and 
              at last proposed to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,' 
              said my mother simply. </p>
            <p>　　'Ha! Poor Baby!' mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent 
              upon the fire. 'Do you know anything?' </p>
            <p>　　'I beg your pardon, ma'am,' faltered my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'About keeping house, for instance,' said Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'Not much, I fear,' returned my mother. 'Not so much as I could 
              wish. But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -' </p>
            <p>　　('Much he knew about it himself!') said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis. 
            </p>
            <p>　　- 'And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, 
              and he very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his 
              death' - my mother broke down again here, and could get no farther. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　-'I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with 
              Mr. Copperfield every night,' cried my mother in another burst of 
              distress, and breaking down again. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. 'Don't cry any more.' </p>
            <p>　　- 'And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting 
              it, except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives 
              being too much like each other, or to my putting curly tails to 
              my sevens and nines,' resumed my mother in another burst, and breaking 
              down again. </p>
            <p>　　'You'll make yourself ill,' said Miss Betsey, 'and you know that 
              will not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You 
              mustn't do it!' </p>
            <p>　　This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her 
              increasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval 
              of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating 
              'Ha!' as she sat with her feet upon the fender. </p>
            <p>　　'David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,' 
              said she, by and by. 'What did he do for you?' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Copperfield,' said my mother, answering with some difficulty, 
              'was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part 
              of it to me.' </p>
            <p>　　'How much?' asked Miss Betsey. </p>
            <p>　　'A hundred and five pounds a year,' said my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'He might have done worse,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much 
              worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and 
              seeing at a glance how ill she was, - as Miss Betsey might have 
              done sooner if there had been light enough, - conveyed her upstairs 
              to her own room with all speed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, 
              her nephew, who had been for some days past secreted in the house, 
              unknown to my mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, 
              to fetch the nurse and doctor. </p>
            <p>　　Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived 
              within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous 
              appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her 
              left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty knowing 
              nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she was 
              quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a magazine 
              of jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in 
              her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her 
              presence. </p>
            <p>　　The doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having 
              satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this 
              unknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for 
              some hours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the 
              meekest of his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and 
              out of a room, to take up the less space. He walked as softly as 
              the Ghost in Hamlet, and more slowly. He carried his head on one 
              side, partly in modest depreciation of himself, partly in modest 
              propitiation of everybody else. It is nothing to say that he hadn't 
              a word to throw at a dog. He couldn't have thrown a word at a mad 
              dog. He might have offered him one gently, or half a one, or a fragment 
              of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked; but he wouldn't have 
              been rude to him, and he couldn't have been quick with him, for 
              any earthly consideration. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, 
              and making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' 
              cotton, as he softly touched his left ear: </p>
            <p>　　'Some local irritation, ma'am?' </p>
            <p>　　'What!' replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like 
              a cork. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness - as he told my 
              mother afterwards - that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence 
              of mind. But he repeated sweetly: </p>
            <p>　　'Some local irritation, ma'am?' </p>
            <p>　　'Nonsense!' replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one 
              blow. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at 
              her feebly, as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called 
              upstairs again. After some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest 
              to him. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are- we are progressing 
              slowly, ma'am.' </p>
            <p>　　'Ba--a--ah!' said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous 
              interjection. And corked herself as before. </p>
            <p>　　Really - really - as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost 
              shocked; speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was 
              almost shocked. But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for 
              nearly two hours, as she sat looking at the fire, until he was again 
              called out. After another absence, he again returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Well?' said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are - we are progressing 
            </p>
            <p>　　slowly, ma'am.' </p>
            <p>　　'Ya--a--ah!' said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. 
              Chillip absolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to 
              break his spirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit 
              upon the stairs, in the dark and a strong draught, until he was 
              again sent for. </p>
            <p>　　Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very 
              dragon at his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a 
              credible witness, reported next day, that happening to peep in at 
              the parlour-door an hour after this, he was instantly descried by 
              Miss Betsey, then walking to and fro in a state of agitation, and 
              pounced upon before he could make his escape. That there were now 
              occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred 
              the cotton did not exclude, from the circumstance of his evidently 
              being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant 
              agitation when the sounds were loudest. That, marching him constantly 
              up and down by the collar (as if he had been taking too much laudanum), 
              she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his hair, made light of 
              his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own, 
              and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was in part confirmed 
              by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o'clock, soon after 
              his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was. </p>
            <p>　　The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a 
              time, if at any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was 
              at liberty, and said to my aunt in his meekest manner: </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.' </p>
            <p>　　'What upon?' said my aunt, sharply. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my 
              aunt's manner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little 
              smile, to mollify her. </p>
            <p>　　'Mercy on the man, what's he doing!' cried my aunt, impatiently. 
              'Can't he speak?' </p>
            <p>　　'Be calm, my dear ma'am,' said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am. Be calm.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't 
              shake him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook 
              her own head at him, but in a way that made him quail. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am,' resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, 
              'I am happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well 
              over.' </p>
            <p>　　During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the 
              delivery of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly. </p>
            <p>　　'How is she?' said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet 
              still tied on one of them. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,' returned 
              Mr. Chillip. 'Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother 
              to be, under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot 
              be any objection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. It may do 
              her good.' </p>
            <p>　　'And SHE. How is SHE?' said my aunt, sharply. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked 
              at my aunt like an amiable bird. </p>
            <p>　　'The baby,' said my aunt. 'How is she?' </p>
            <p>　　'Ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'I apprehended you had known. 
              It's a boy.' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, 
              in the manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with 
              it, put it on bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished 
              like a discontented fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, 
              whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see; and never 
              came back any more. </p>
            <p>　　No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey 
              Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, 
              the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the 
              light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne 
              of all such travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust 
              that once was he, without whom I had never been. </p>

            <p>　　 There was a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, 
              was usually with Steerforth, and had come into his service at the 
              University, who was in appearance a pattern of respectability. I 
              believe there never existed in his station a more respectable-looking 
              man. He was taciturn, soft-footed, very quiet in his manner, deferential, 
              observant, always at hand when wanted, and never near when not wanted; 
              but his great claim to consideration was his respectability. He 
              had not a pliant face, he had rather a stiff neck, rather a tight 
              smooth head with short hair clinging to it at the sides, a soft 
              way of speaking, with a peculiar habit of whispering the letter 
              S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it oftener than any other 
              man; but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable. If his 
              nose had been upside-down, he would have made that respectable. 
              He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability, and 
              walked secure in it. It would have been next to impossible to suspect 
              him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable. Nobody 
              could have thought of putting him in a livery, he was so highly 
              respectable. To have imposed any derogatory work upon him, would 
              have been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable 
              man. And of this, I noticed- the women-servants in the household 
              were so intuitively conscious, that they always did such work themselves, 
              and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire. </p>
            <p>　　Such a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as 
              in every other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. 
              Even the fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form 
              a part of his respectability. Nothing could be objected against 
              his surname, Littimer, by which he was known. Peter might have been 
              hanged, or Tom transported; but Littimer was perfectly respectable. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability 
              in the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence. 
              How old he was himself, I could not guess - and that again went 
              to his credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability 
              he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty. </p>
            <p>　　Littimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring 
              me that reproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes. When 
              I undrew the curtains and looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable 
              temperature of respectability, unaffected by the east wind of January, 
              and not even breathing frostily, standing my boots right and left 
              in the first dancing position, and blowing specks of dust off my 
              coat as he laid it down like a baby. </p>
            <p>　　I gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was. He 
              took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever 
              saw, and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far, 
              looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, 
              shut it up again, and said, if I pleased, it was half past eight. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you,' said I, 'very well indeed. Is Mr. Steerforth quite 
              well?' </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well.' Another of 
              his characteristics - no use of superlatives. A cool calm medium 
              always. </p>
            <p>　　'Is there anything more I can have the honour of doing for you, 
              sir? The warning-bell will ring at nine; the family take breakfast 
              at half past nine.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing, I thank you.' </p>
            <p>　　'I thank YOU, sir, if you please'; and with that, and with a 
              little inclination of his head when he passed the bed-side, as an 
              apology for correcting me, he went out, shutting the door as delicately 
              as if I had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Every morning we held exactly this conversation: never any more, 
              and never any less: and yet, invariably, however far I might have 
              been lifted out of myself over-night, and advanced towards maturer 
              years, by Steerforth's companionship, or Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, 
              or Miss Dartle's conversation, in the presence of this most respectable 
              man I became, as our smaller poets sing, 'a boy again'. </p>
            <p>　　He got horses for us; and Steerforth, who knew everything, gave 
              me lessons in riding. He provided foils for us, and Steerforth gave 
              me lessons in fencing - gloves, and I began, of the same master, 
              to improve in boxing. It gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth 
              should find me a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear 
              to show my want of skill before the respectable Littimer. I had 
              no reason to believe that Littimer understood such arts himself; 
              he never led me to suppose anything of the kind, by so much as the 
              vibration of one of his respectable eyelashes; yet whenever he was 
              by, while we were practising, I felt myself the greenest and most 
              inexperienced of mortals. </p>
            <p>　　I am particular about this man, because he made a particular 
              effect on me at that time, and because of what took place thereafter. 
            </p>
            <p>　　The week passed away in a most delightful manner. It passed rapidly, 
              as may be supposed, to one entranced as I was; and yet it gave me 
              so many occasions for knowing Steerforth better, and admiring him 
              more in a thousand respects, that at its close I seemed to have 
              been with him for a much longer time. A dashing way he had of treating 
              me like a plaything, was more agreeable to me than any behaviour 
              he could have adopted. It reminded me of our old acquaintance; it 
              seemed the natural sequel of it; it showed me that he was unchanged; 
              it relieved me of any uneasiness I might have felt, in comparing 
              my merits with his, and measuring my claims upon his friendship 
              by any equal standard; above all, it was a familiar, unrestrained, 
              affectionate demeanour that he used towards no one else. As he had 
              treated me at school differently from all the rest, I joyfully believed 
              that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he had. I believed 
              that I was nearer to his heart than any other friend, and my own 
              heart warmed with attachment to him. He made up his mind to go with 
              me into the country, and the day arrived for our departure. He had 
              been doubtful at first whether to take Littimer or not, but decided 
              to leave him at home. The respectable creature, satisfied with his 
              lot whatever it was, arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage 
              that was to take us into London, as if they were intended to defy 
              the shocks of ages, and received my modestly proffered donation 
              with perfect tranquillity. </p>
            <p>　　We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks 
              on my part, and much kindness on the devoted mother's. The last 
              thing I saw was Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, 
              with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed. </p>
            <p>　　What I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar 
              places, I shall not endeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail. 
              I was so concerned, I recollect, even for the honour of Yarmouth, 
              that when Steerforth said, as we drove through its dark streets 
              to the inn, that, as well as he could make out, it was a good, queer, 
              out-of-the-way kind of hole, I was highly pleased. We went to bed 
              on our arrival (I observed a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in 
              connexion with my old friend the Dolphin as we passed that door), 
              and breakfasted late in the morning. Steerforth, who was in great 
              spirits, had been strolling about the beach before I was up, and 
              had made acquaintance, he said, with half the boatmen in the place. 
              Moreover, he had seen, in the distance, what he was sure must be 
              the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke coming out of the 
              chimney; and had had a great mind, he told me, to walk in and swear 
              he was myself grown out of knowledge. </p>
            <p>　　'When do you propose to introduce me there, Daisy?' he said. 
              'I am at your disposal. Make your own arrangements.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, 
              Steerforth, when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like 
              you to see it when it's snug, it's such a curious place.' </p>
            <p>　　'So be it!' returned Steerforth. 'This evening.' </p>
            <p>　　'I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know,' 
              said I, delighted. 'We must take them by surprise.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, of course! It's no fun,' said Steerforth, 'unless we take 
              them by surprise. Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned,' I returned. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Aha! What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?' he 
              exclaimed with a quick look. 'Confound the girl, I am half afraid 
              of her. She's like a goblin to me. But never mind her. Now what 
              are you going to do? You are going to see your nurse, I suppose?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Why, yes,' I said, 'I must see Peggotty first of all.' </p>
            <p>　　'Well,' replied Steerforth, looking at his watch. 'Suppose I 
              deliver you up to be cried over for a couple of hours. Is that long 
              enough?' </p>
            <p>　　I answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it 
              in that time, but that he must come also; for he would find that 
              his renown had preceded him, and that he was almost as great a personage 
              as I was. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll come anywhere you like,' said Steerforth, 'or do anything 
              you like. Tell me where to come to; and in two hours I'll produce 
              myself in any state you please, sentimental or comical.' </p>
            <p>　　I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. 
              Barkis, carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere; and, on this understanding, 
              went out alone. There was a sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; 
              the sea was crisp and clear; the sun was diffusing abundance of 
              light, if not much warmth; and everything was fresh and lively. 
              I was so fresh and lively myself, in the pleasure of being there, 
              that I could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands 
              with them. </p>
            <p>　　The streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have 
              only seen as children always do, I believe, when we go back to them. 
              But I had forgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, 
              until I came to Mr. Omer's shop. OMER AND Joram was now written 
              up, where OMER used to be; but the inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, 
              HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &amp;c., remained as it was. </p>
            <p>　　My footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door, after 
              I had read these words from over the way, that I went across the 
              road and looked in. There was a pretty woman at the back of the 
              shop, dancing a little child in her arms, while another little fellow 
              clung to her apron. I had no difficulty in recognizing either Minnie 
              or Minnie's children. The glass door of the parlour was not open; 
              but in the workshop across the yard I could faintly hear the old 
              tune playing, as if it had never left off. </p>
            <p>　　'Is Mr. Omer at home?' said I, entering. 'I should like to see 
              him, for a moment, if he is.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh yes, sir, he is at home,' said Minnie; 'the weather don't 
              suit his asthma out of doors. Joe, call your grandfather!' </p>
            <p>　　The little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty 
              shout, that the sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his 
              face in her skirts, to her great admiration. I heard a heavy puffing 
              and blowing coming towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded 
              than of yore, but not much older-looking, stood before me. </p>
            <p>　　'Servant, sir,' said Mr. Omer. 'What can I do for you, sir?' 
              'You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please,' said I, 
              putting out my own. 'You were very good-natured to me once, when 
              I am afraid I didn't show that I thought so.' </p>
            <p>　　'Was I though?' returned the old man. 'I'm glad to hear it, but 
              I don't remember when. Are you sure it was me?' </p>
            <p>　　'Quite.' 'I think my memory has got as short as my breath,' said 
              Mr. Omer, looking at me and shaking his head; 'for I don't remember 
              you.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you remember your coming to the coach to meet me, and 
              my having breakfast here, and our riding out to Blunderstone together: 
              you, and I, and Mrs. Joram, and Mr. Joram too - who wasn't her husband 
              then?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Lord bless my soul!' exclaimed Mr. Omer, after being thrown 
              by his surprise into a fit of coughing, 'you don't say so! Minnie, 
              my dear, you recollect? Dear me, yes; the party was a lady, I think?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My mother,' I rejoined. </p>
            <p>　　'To - be - sure,' said Mr. Omer, touching my waistcoat with his 
              forefinger, 'and there was a little child too! There was two parties. 
              The little party was laid along with the other party. Over at Blunderstone 
              it was, of course. Dear me! And how have you been since?' </p>
            <p>　　Very well, I thanked him, as I hoped he had been too. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! nothing to grumble at, you know,' said Mr. Omer. 'I find 
              my breath gets short, but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older. 
              I take it as it comes, and make the most of it. That's the best 
              way, ain't it?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Omer coughed again, in consequence of laughing, and was assisted 
              out of his fit by his daughter, who now stood close beside us, dancing 
              her smallest child on the counter. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' said Mr. Omer. 'Yes, to be sure. Two parties! Why, 
              in that very ride, if you'll believe me, the day was named for my 
              Minnie to marry Joram. &quot;Do name it, sir,&quot; says Joram. 
              &quot;Yes, do, father,&quot; says Minnie. And now he's come into 
              the business. And look here! The youngest!' </p>
            <p>　　Minnie laughed, and stroked her banded hair upon her temples, 
              as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child 
              she was dancing on the counter. </p>
            <p>　　'Two parties, of course!' said Mr. Omer, nodding his head retrospectively. 
              'Ex-actly so! And Joram's at work, at this minute, on a grey one 
              with silver nails, not this measurement' - the measurement of the 
              dancing child upon the counter - 'by a good two inches. - Will you 
              take something?' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him, but declined. </p>
            <p>　　'Let me see,' said Mr. Omer. 'Barkis's the carrier's wife - Peggotty's 
              the boatman's sister - she had something to do with your family? 
              She was in service there, sure?' </p>
            <p>　　My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I believe my breath will get long next, my memory's getting 
              so much so,' said Mr. Omer. 'Well, sir, we've got a young relation 
              of hers here, under articles to us, that has as elegant a taste 
              in the dress-making business - I assure you I don't believe there's 
              a Duchess in England can touch her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Not little Em'ly?' said I, involuntarily. </p>
            <p>　　'Em'ly's her name,' said Mr. Omer, 'and she's little too. But 
              if you'll believe me, she has such a face of her own that half the 
              women in this town are mad against her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nonsense, father!' cried Minnie. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' said Mr. Omer, 'I don't say it's the case with you,' 
              winking at me, 'but I say that half the women in Yarmouth - ah! 
              and in five mile round - are mad against that girl.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then she should have kept to her own station in life, father,' 
              said Minnie, 'and not have given them any hold to talk about her, 
              and then they couldn't have done it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Couldn't have done it, my dear!' retorted Mr. Omer. 'Couldn't 
              have done it! Is that YOUR knowledge of life? What is there that 
              any woman couldn't do, that she shouldn't do - especially on the 
              subject of another woman's good looks?' </p>
            <p>　　I really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer, after he had 
              uttered this libellous pleasantry. He coughed to that extent, and 
              his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy, 
              that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter, 
              and his little black breeches, with the rusty little bunches of 
              ribbons at the knees, come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle. 
              At length, however, he got better, though he still panted hard, 
              and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of 
              the shop-desk. </p>
            <p>　　'You see,' he said, wiping his head, and breathing with difficulty, 
              'she hasn't taken much to any companions here; she hasn't taken 
              kindly to any particular acquaintances and friends, not to mention 
              sweethearts. In consequence, an ill-natured story got about, that 
              Em'ly wanted to be a lady. Now my opinion is, that it came into 
              circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying, at the 
              school, that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for 
              her uncle - don't you see? - and buy him such-and-such fine things.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me,' I returned eagerly, 
              'when we were both children.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin. 'Just so. Then 
              out of a very little, she could dress herself, you see, better than 
              most others could out of a deal, and that made things unpleasant. 
              Moreover, she was rather what might be called wayward - I'll go 
              so far as to say what I should call wayward myself,' said Mr. Omer; 
              '- didn't know her own mind quite - a little spoiled - and couldn't, 
              at first, exactly bind herself down. No more than that was ever 
              said against her, Minnie?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, father,' said Mrs. Joram. 'That's the worst, I believe.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'So when she got a situation,' said Mr. Omer, 'to keep a fractious 
              old lady company, they didn't very well agree, and she didn't stop. 
              At last she came here, apprenticed for three years. Nearly two of 
              'em are over, and she has been as good a girl as ever was. Worth 
              any six! Minnie, is she worth any six, now?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, father,' replied Minnie. 'Never say I detracted from her!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Very good,' said Mr. Omer. 'That's right. And so, young gentleman,' 
              he added, after a few moments' further rubbing of his chin, 'that 
              you may not consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I 
              believe that's all about it.' </p>
            <p>　　As they had spoken in a subdued tone, while speaking of Em'ly, 
              I had no doubt that she was near. On my asking now, if that were 
              not so, Mr. Omer nodded yes, and nodded towards the door of the 
              parlour. My hurried inquiry if I might peep in, was answered with 
              a free permission; and, looking through the glass, I saw her sitting 
              at her work. I saw her, a most beautiful little creature, with the 
              cloudless blue eyes, that had looked into my childish heart, turned 
              laughingly upon another child of Minnie's who was playing near her; 
              with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what I had 
              heard; with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it; but 
              with nothing in her pretty looks, I am sure, but what was meant 
              for goodness and for happiness, and what was on a good and </p>
            <p>　　happy course. </p>
            <p>　　The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left 
              off - alas! it was the tune that never DOES leave off - was beating, 
              softly, all the while. </p>
            <p>　　'Wouldn't you like to step in,' said Mr. Omer, 'and speak to 
              her? Walk in and speak to her, sir! Make yourself at home!' </p>
            <p>　　I was too bashful to do so then - I was afraid of confusing her, 
              and I was no less afraid of confusing myself.- but I informed myself 
              of the hour at which she left of an evening, in order that our visit 
              might be timed accordingly; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his 
              pretty daughter, and her little children, went away to my dear old 
              Peggotty's. </p>
            <p>　　Here she was, in the tiled kitchen, cooking dinner! The moment 
              I knocked at the door she opened it, and asked me what I pleased 
              to want. I looked at her with a smile, but she gave me no smile 
              in return. I had never ceased to write to her, but it must have 
              been seven years since we had met. </p>
            <p>　　'Is Mr. Barkis at home, ma'am?' I said, feigning to speak roughly 
              to her. </p>
            <p>　　'He's at home, sir,' returned Peggotty, 'but he's bad abed with 
              the rheumatics.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't he go over to Blunderstone now?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'When he's well he do,' she answered. </p>
            <p>　　'Do YOU ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?' </p>
            <p>　　She looked at me more attentively, and I noticed a quick movement 
              of her hands towards each other. </p>
            <p>　　'Because I want to ask a question about a house there, that they 
              call the - what is it? - the Rookery,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　She took a step backward, and put out her hands in an undecided 
              frightened way, as if to keep me off. </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty!' I cried to her. </p>
            <p>　　She cried, 'My darling boy!' and we both burst into tears, and 
              were locked in one another's arms. </p>
            <p>　　What extravagances she committed; what laughing and crying over 
              me; what pride she showed, what joy, what sorrow that she whose 
              pride and joy I might have been, could never hold me in a fond embrace; 
              I have not the heart to tell. I was troubled with no misgiving that 
              it was young in me to respond to her emotions. I had never laughed 
              and cried in all my life, I dare say - not even to her - more freely 
              than I did that morning. </p>
            <p>　　'Barkis will be so glad,' said Peggotty, wiping her eyes with 
              her apron, 'that it'll do him more good than pints of liniment. 
              May I go and tell him you are here? Will you come up and see him, 
              my dear?' </p>
            <p>　　Of course I would. But Peggotty could not get out of the room 
              as easily as she meant to, for as often as she got to the door and 
              looked round at me, she came back again to have another laugh and 
              another cry upon my shoulder. At last, to make the matter easier, 
              I went upstairs with her; and having waited outside for a minute, 
              while she said a word of preparation to Mr. Barkis, presented myself 
              before that invalid. </p>
            <p>　　He received me with absolute enthusiasm. He was too rheumatic 
              to be shaken hands with, but he begged me to shake the tassel on 
              the top of his nightcap, which I did most cordially. When I sat 
              down by the side of the bed, he said that it did him a world of 
              good to feel as if he was driving me on the Blunderstone road again. 
              As he lay in bed, face upward, and so covered, with that exception, 
              that he seemed to be nothing but a face - like a conventional cherubim 
              - he looked the queerest object I ever beheld. </p>
            <p>　　'What name was it, as I wrote up in the cart, sir?' said Mr. 
              Barkis, with a slow rheumatic smile. </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! Mr. Barkis, we had some grave talks about that matter, hadn't 
              we?' </p>
            <p>　　'I was willin' a long time, sir?' said Mr. Barkis. </p>
            <p>　　'A long time,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you remember what 
              you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing 
              all the cooking?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, very well,' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'It was as true,' said Mr. Barkis, 'as turnips is. It was as 
              true,' said Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, which was his only 
              means of emphasis, 'as taxes is. And nothing's truer than them.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, as if for my assent to this 
              result of his reflections in bed; and I gave it. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing's truer than them,' repeated Mr. Barkis; 'a man as poor 
              as I am, finds that out in his mind when he's laid up. I'm a very 
              poor man, sir!' </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.' </p>
            <p>　　'A very poor man, indeed I am,' said Mr. Barkis. </p>
            <p>　　Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes, 
              and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which 
              was loosely tied to the side of the bed. After some poking about 
              with this instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a 
              variety of distracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked it against a 
              box, an end of which had been visible to me all the time. Then his 
              face became composed. </p>
            <p>　　'Old clothes,' said Mr. Barkis. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I wish it was Money, sir,' said Mr. Barkis. </p>
            <p>　　'I wish it was, indeed,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'But it AIN'T,' said Mr. Barkis, opening both his eyes as wide 
              as he possibly could. </p>
            <p>　　I expressed myself quite sure of that, and Mr. Barkis, turning 
              his eyes more gently to his wife, said: </p>
            <p>　　'She's the usefullest and best of women, C. P. Barkis. All the 
              praise that anyone can give to C. P. Barkis, she deserves, and more! 
              My dear, you'll get a dinner today, for company; something good 
              to eat and drink, will you?' </p>
            <p>　　I should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration 
              in my honour, but that I saw Peggotty, on the opposite side of the 
              bed, extremely anxious I should not. So I held my peace. </p>
            <p>　　'I have got a trifle of money somewhere about me, my dear,' said 
              Mr. Barkis, 'but I'm a little tired. If you and Mr. David will leave 
              me for a short nap, I'll try and find it when I wake.' </p>
            <p>　　We left the room, in compliance with this request. When we got 
              outside the door, Peggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis, being now 
              'a little nearer' than he used to be, always resorted to this same 
              device before producing a single coin from his store; and that he 
              endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking 
              it from that unlucky box. In effect, we presently heard him uttering 
              suppressed groans of the most dismal nature, as this magpie proceeding 
              racked him in every joint; but while Peggotty's eyes were full of 
              compassion for him, she said his generous impulse would do him good, 
              and it was better not to check it. So he groaned on, until he had 
              got into bed again, suffering, I have no doubt, a martyrdom; and 
              then called us in, pretending to have just woke up from a refreshing 
              sleep, and to produce a guinea from under his pillow. His satisfaction 
              in which happy imposition on us, and in having preserved the impenetrable 
              secret of the box, appeared to be a sufficient compensation to him 
              for all his tortures. </p>
            <p>　　I prepared Peggotty for Steerforth's arrival and it was not long 
              before he came. I am persuaded she knew no difference between his 
              having been a personal benefactor of hers, and a kind friend to 
              me, and that she would have received him with the utmost gratitude 
              and devotion in any case. But his easy, spirited good humour; his 
              genial manner, his handsome looks, his natural gift of adapting 
              himself to whomsoever he pleased, and making direct, when he cared 
              to do it, to the main point of interest in anybody's heart; bound 
              her to him wholly in five minutes. His manner to me, alone, would 
              have won her. But, through all these causes combined, I sincerely 
              believe she had a kind of adoration for him before he left the house 
              that night. </p>
            <p>　　He stayed there with me to dinner - if I were to say willingly, 
              I should not half express how readily and gaily. He went into Mr. 
              Barkis's room like light and air, brightening and refreshing it 
              as if he were healthy weather. There was no noise, no effort, no 
              consciousness, in anything he did; but in everything an indescribable 
              lightness, a seeming impossibility of doing anything else, or doing 
              anything better, which was so graceful, so natural, and agreeable, 
              that it overcomes me, even now, in the remembrance. </p>
            <p>　　We made merry in the little parlour, where the Book of Martyrs, 
              unthumbed since my time, was laid out upon the desk as of old, and 
              where I now turned over its terrific pictures, remembering the old 
              sensations they had awakened, but not feeling them. When Peggotty 
              spoke of what she called my room, and of its being ready for me 
              at night, and of her hoping I would occupy it, before I could so 
              much as look at Steerforth, hesitating, he was possessed of the 
              whole case. </p>
            <p>　　'Of course,' he said. 'You'll sleep here, while we stay, and 
              I shall sleep at the hotel.' </p>
            <p>　　'But to bring you so far,' I returned, 'and to separate, seems 
              bad companionship, Steerforth.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, in the name of Heaven, where do you naturally belong?' 
              he said. 'What is &quot;seems&quot;, compared to that?' It was settled 
              at once. </p>
            <p>　　He maintained all his delightful qualities to the last, until 
              we started forth, at eight o'clock, for Mr. Peggotty's boat. Indeed, 
              they were more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on; 
              for I thought even then, and I have no doubt now, that the consciousness 
              of success in his determination to please, inspired him with a new 
              delicacy of perception, and made it, subtle as it was, more easy 
              to him. If anyone had told me, then, that all this was a brilliant 
              game, played for the excitement of the moment, for the employment 
              of high spirits, in the thoughtless love of superiority, in a mere 
              wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him, and 
              next minute thrown away - I say, if anyone had told me such a lie 
              that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation 
              would have found a vent! Probably only in an increase, had that 
              been possible, of the romantic feelings of fidelity and friendship 
              with which I walked beside him, over the dark wintry sands towards 
              the old boat; the wind sighing around us even more mournfully, than 
              it had sighed and moaned upon the night when I first darkened Mr. 
              Peggotty's door. </p>
            <p>　　'This is a wild kind of place, Steerforth, is it not?' </p>
            <p>　　'Dismal enough in the dark,' he said: 'and the sea roars as if 
              it were hungry for us. Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder?' 
              'That's the boat,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'And it's the same I saw this morning,' he returned. 'I came 
              straight to it, by instinct, I suppose.' </p>
            <p>　　We said no more as we approached the light, but made softly for 
              the door. I laid my hand upon the latch; and whispering Steerforth 
              to keep close to me, went in. </p>
            <p>　　A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside, and, at the 
              moment of our entrance, a clapping of hands: which latter noise, 
              I was surprised to see, proceeded from the generally disconsolate 
              Mrs. Gummidge. But Mrs. Gummidge was not the only person there who 
              was unusually excited. Mr. Peggotty, his face lighted up with uncommon 
              satisfaction, and laughing with all his might, held his rough arms 
              wide open, as if for little Em'ly to run into them; Ham, with a 
              mixed expression in his face of admiration, exultation, and a lumbering 
              sort of bashfulness that sat upon him very well, held little Em'ly 
              by the hand, as if he were presenting her to Mr. Peggotty; little 
              Em'ly herself, blushing and shy, but delighted with Mr. Peggotty's 
              delight, as her joyous eyes expressed, was stopped by our entrance 
              (for she saw us first) in the very act of springing from Ham to 
              nestle in Mr. Peggotty's embrace. In the first glimpse we had of 
              them all, and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night 
              into the warm light room, this was the way in which they were all 
              employed: Mrs. Gummidge in the background, clapping her hands like 
              a madwoman. </p>
            <p>　　The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going 
              in, that one might have doubted whether it had ever been. I was 
              in the midst of the astonished family, face to face with Mr. Peggotty, 
              and holding out my hand to him, when Ham shouted: </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy! It's Mas'r Davy!' </p>
            <p>　　In a moment we were all shaking hands with one another, and asking 
              one another how we did, and telling one another how glad we were 
              to meet, and all talking at once. Mr. Peggotty was so proud and 
              overjoyed to see us, that he did not know what to say or do, but 
              kept over and over again shaking hands with me, and then with Steerforth, 
              and then with me, and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his 
              head, and laughing with such glee and triumph, that it was a treat 
              to see him. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, that you two gent'lmen - gent'lmen growed - should come 
              to this here roof tonight, of all nights in my life,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              'is such a thing as never happened afore, I do rightly believe! 
              Em'ly, my darling, come here! Come here, my little witch! There's 
              Mas'r Davy's friend, my dear! There's the gent'lman as you've heerd 
              on, Em'ly. He comes to see you, along with Mas'r Davy, on the brightest 
              night of your uncle's life as ever was or will be, Gorm the t'other 
              one, and horroar for it!' </p>
            <p>　　After delivering this speech all in a breath, and with extraordinary 
              animation and pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one of his large hands 
              rapturously on each side of his niece's face, and kissing it a dozen 
              times, laid it with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest, 
              and patted it as if his hand had been a lady's. Then he let her 
              go; and as she ran into the little chamber where I used to sleep, 
              looked round upon us, quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon 
              satisfaction. </p>
            <p>　　'If you two gent'lmen - gent'lmen growed now, and such gent'lmen 
              -' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'So th' are, so th' are!' cried Ham. 'Well said! So th' are. 
              Mas'r Davy bor' - gent'lmen growed - so th' are!' </p>
            <p>　　'If you two gent'lmen, gent'lmen growed,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              'don't ex-cuse me for being in a state of mind, when you understand 
              matters, I'll arks your pardon. Em'ly, my dear! - She knows I'm 
              a going to tell,' here his delight broke out again, 'and has made 
              off. Would you be so good as look arter her, Mawther, for a minute?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared. 'If this ain't,' said Mr. 
              Peggotty, sitting down among us by the fire, 'the brightest night 
              o' my life, I'm a shellfish - biled too - and more I can't say. 
              This here little Em'ly, sir,' in a low voice to Steerforth, '- her 
              as you see a blushing here just now -' </p>
            <p>　　Steerforth only nodded; but with such a pleased expression of 
              interest, and of participation in Mr. Peggotty's feelings, that 
              the latter answered him as if he had spoken. </p>
            <p>　　'To be sure,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'That's her, and so she is. 
              Thankee, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　Ham nodded to me several times, as if he would have said so too. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'This here little Em'ly of ours,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'has been, 
              in our house, what I suppose (I'm a ignorant man, but that's my 
              belief) no one but a little bright-eyed creetur can be in a house. 
              She ain't my child; I never had one; but I couldn't love her more. 
              You understand! I couldn't do it!' </p>
            <p>　　'I quite understand,' said Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　'I know you do, sir,' returned Mr. Peggotty, 'and thankee again. 
              Mas'r Davy, he can remember what she was; you may judge for your 
              own self what she is; but neither of you can't fully know what she 
              has been, is, and will be, to my loving art. I am rough, sir,' said 
              Mr. Peggotty, 'I am as rough as a Sea Porkypine; but no one, unless, 
              mayhap, it is a woman, can know, I think, what our little Em'ly 
              is to me. And betwixt ourselves,' sinking his voice lower yet, 'that 
              woman's name ain't Missis Gummidge neither, though she has a world 
              of merits.' Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again, with both hands, 
              as a further preparation for what he was going to say, and went 
              on, with a hand upon each of his knees: </p>
            <p>　　'There was a certain person as had know'd our Em'ly, from the 
              time when her father was drownded; as had seen her constant; when 
              a babby, when a young gal, when a woman. Not much of a person to 
              look at, he warn't,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'something o' my own build 
              - rough - a good deal o' the sou'-wester in him - wery salt - but, 
              on the whole, a honest sort of a chap, with his art in the right 
              place.' </p>
            <p>　　I thought I had never seen Ham grin to anything like the extent 
              to which he sat grinning at us now. </p>
            <p>　　'What does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do,' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              with his face one high noon of enjoyment, 'but he loses that there 
              art of his to our little Em'ly. He follers her about, he makes hisself 
              a sort o' servant to her, he loses in a great measure his relish 
              for his wittles, and in the long-run he makes it clear to me wot's 
              amiss. Now I could wish myself, you see, that our little Em'ly was 
              in a fair way of being married. I could wish to see her, at all 
              ewents, under articles to a honest man as had a right to defend 
              her. I don't know how long I may live, or how soon I may die; but 
              I know that if I was capsized, any night, in a gale of wind in Yarmouth 
              Roads here, and was to see the town-lights shining for the last 
              time over the rollers as I couldn't make no head against, I could 
              go down quieter for thinking &quot;There's a man ashore there, iron-true 
              to my little Em'ly, God bless her, and no wrong can touch my Em'ly 
              while so be as that man lives.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved his right arm, as 
              if he were waving it at the town-lights for the last time, and then, 
              exchanging a nod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well! I counsels him to speak to Em'ly. He's big enough, but 
              he's bashfuller than a little un, and he don't like. So I speak. 
              &quot;What! Him!&quot; says Em'ly. &quot;Him that I've know'd so 
              intimate so many years, and like so much. Oh, Uncle! I never can 
              have him. He's such a good fellow!&quot; I gives her a kiss, and 
              I says no more to her than, &quot;My dear, you're right to speak 
              out, you're to choose for yourself, you're as free as a little bird.&quot; 
              Then I aways to him, and I says, &quot;I wish it could have been 
              so, but it can't. But you can both be as you was, and wot I say 
              to you is, Be as you was with her, like a man.&quot; He says to 
              me, a-shaking of my hand, &quot;I will!&quot; he says. And he was 
              - honourable and manful - for two year going on, and we was just 
              the same at home here as afore.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty's face, which had varied in its expression with 
              the various stages of his narrative, now resumed all its former 
              triumphant delight, as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon 
              Steerforth's (previously wetting them both, for the greater emphasis 
              of the action), and divided the following speech between us: </p>
            <p>　　'All of a sudden, one evening - as it might be tonight - comes 
              little Em'ly from her work, and him with her! There ain't so much 
              in that, you'll say. No, because he takes care on her, like a brother, 
              arter dark, and indeed afore dark, and at all times. But this tarpaulin 
              chap, he takes hold of her hand, and he cries out to me, joyful, 
              &quot;Look here! This is to be my little wife!&quot; And she says, 
              half bold and half shy, and half a laughing and half a crying, &quot;Yes, 
              Uncle! If you please.&quot; - If I please!' cried Mr. Peggotty, 
              rolling his head in an ecstasy at the idea; 'Lord, as if I should 
              do anythink else! - &quot;If you please, I am steadier now, and 
              I have thought better of it, and I'll be as good a little wife as 
              I can to him, for he's a dear, good fellow!&quot; Then Missis Gummidge, 
              she claps her hands like a play, and you come in. Theer! the murder's 
              out!' said Mr. Peggotty - 'You come in! It took place this here 
              present hour; and here's the man that'll marry her, the minute she's 
              out of her time.' </p>
            <p>　　Ham staggered, as well he might, under the blow Mr. Peggotty 
              dealt him in his unbounded joy, as a mark of confidence and friendship; 
              but feeling called upon to say something to us, he said, with much 
              faltering and great difficulty: </p>
            <p>　　'She warn't no higher than you was, Mas'r Davy - when you first 
              come - when I thought what she'd grow up to be. I see her grown 
              up - gent'lmen - like a flower. I'd lay down my life for her - Mas'r 
              Davy - Oh! most content and cheerful! She's more to me - gent'lmen 
              - than - she's all to me that ever I can want, and more than ever 
              I - than ever I could say. I - I love her true. There ain't a gent'lman 
              in all the land - nor yet sailing upon all the sea - that can love 
              his lady more than I love her, though there's many a common man 
              - would say better - what he meant.' </p>
            <p>　　I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was 
              now, trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little 
              creature who had won his heart. I thought the simple confidence 
              reposed in us by Mr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting. 
              I was affected by the story altogether. How far my emotions were 
              influenced by the recollections of my childhood, I don't know. Whether 
              I had come there with any lingering fancy that I was still to love 
              little Em'ly, I don't know. I know that I was filled with pleasure 
              by all this; but, at first, with an indescribably sensitive pleasure, 
              that a very little would have changed to pain. </p>
            <p>　　Therefore, if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing 
              chord among them with any skill, I should have made a poor hand 
              of it. But it depended upon Steerforth; and he did it with such 
              address, that in a few minutes we were all as easy and as happy 
              as it was possible to be. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Peggotty,' he said, 'you are a thoroughly good fellow, and 
              deserve to be as happy as you are tonight. My hand upon it! Ham, 
              I give you joy, my boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir the 
              fire, and make it a brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can 
              induce your gentle niece to come back (for whom I vacate this seat 
              in the corner), I shall go. Any gap at your fireside on such a night 
              - such a gap least of all - I wouldn't make, for the wealth of the 
              Indies!' </p>
            <p>　　So Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em'ly. 
              At first little Em'ly didn't like to come, and then Ham went. Presently 
              they brought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy, 
              - but she soon became more assured when she found how gently and 
              respectfully Steerforth spoke to her; how skilfully he avoided anything 
              that would embarrass her; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats, 
              and ships, and tides, and fish; how he referred to me about the 
              time when he had seen Mr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted 
              he was with the boat and all belonging to it; how lightly and easily 
              he carried on, until he brought us, by degrees, into a charmed circle, 
              and we were all talking away without any reserve. </p>
            <p>　　Em'ly, indeed, said little all the evening; but she looked, and 
              listened, and her face got animated, and she was charming. Steerforth 
              told a story of a dismal shipwreck (which arose out of his talk 
              with Mr. Peggotty), as if he saw it all before him - and little 
              Em'ly's eyes were fastened on him all the time, as if she saw it 
              too. He told us a merry adventure of his own, as a relief to that, 
              with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to him as 
              it was to us - and little Em'ly laughed until the boat rang with 
              the musical sounds, and we all laughed (Steerforth too), in irresistible 
              sympathy with what was so pleasant and light-hearted. He got Mr. 
              Peggotty to sing, or rather to roar, 'When the stormy winds do blow, 
              do blow, do blow'; and he sang a sailor's song himself, so pathetically 
              and beautifully, that I could have almost fancied that the real 
              wind creeping sorrowfully round the house, and murmuring low through 
              our unbroken silence, was there to listen. </p>
            <p>　　As to Mrs. Gummidge, he roused that victim of despondency with 
              a success never attained by anyone else (so Mr. Peggotty informed 
              me), since the decease of the old one. He left her so little leisure 
              for being miserable, that she said next day she thought she must 
              have been bewitched. </p>
            <p>　　But he set up no monopoly of the general attention, or the conversation. 
              When little Em'ly grew more courageous, and talked (but still bashfully) 
              across the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to 
              pick up shells and pebbles; and when I asked her if she recollected 
              how I used to be devoted to her; and when we both laughed and reddened, 
              casting these looks back on the pleasant old times, so unreal to 
              look at now; he was silent and attentive, and observed us thoughtfully. 
              She sat, at this time, and all the evening, on the old locker in 
              her old little corner by the fire - Ham beside her, where I used 
              to sit. I could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little 
              tormenting way, or in a maidenly reserve before us, that she kept 
              quite close to the wall, and away from him; but I observed that 
              she did so, all the evening. </p>
            <p>　　As I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. 
              We had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth 
              had produced from his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we 
              men (I may say we men, now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted 
              merrily; and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us 
              as far as they could upon our road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of 
              little Em'ly peeping after us, from behind Ham, and heard her soft 
              voice calling to us to be careful how we went. </p>
            <p>　　'A most engaging little Beauty!' said Steerforth, taking my arm. 
              'Well! It's a quaint place, and they are quaint company, and it's 
              quite a new sensation to mix with them.' </p>
            <p>　　'How fortunate we are, too,' I returned, 'to have arrived to 
              witness their happiness in that intended marriage! I never saw people 
              so happy. How delightful to see it, and to be made the sharers in 
              their honest joy, as we have been!' </p>
            <p>　　'That's rather a chuckle-headed fellow for the girl; isn't he?' 
              said Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　He had been so hearty with him, and with them all, that I felt 
              a shock in this unexpected and cold reply. But turning quickly upon 
              him, and seeing a laugh in his eyes, I answered, much relieved: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Ah, Steerforth! It's well for you to joke about the poor! You 
              may skirmish with Miss Dartle, or try to hide your sympathies in 
              jest from me, but I know better. When I see how perfectly you understand 
              them, how exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain 
              fisherman's, or humour a love like my old nurse's, I know that there 
              is not a joy or sorrow, not an emotion, of such people, that can 
              be indifferent to you. And I admire and love you for it, Steerforth, 
              twenty times the more!' </p>
            <p>　　He stopped, and, looking in my face, said, 'Daisy, I believe 
              you are in earnest, and are good. I wish we all were!' Next moment 
              he was gaily singing Mr. Peggotty's song, as we walked at a round 
              pace back to Yarmouth. </p>
